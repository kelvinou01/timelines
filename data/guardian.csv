"‘War-enabling, not war-winning’: how are drones affecting the Ukraine war?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/war-enabling-not-war-winning-how-are-drones-affecting-the-ukraine-war,2022-05-15T07:00:25Z,"<strong>Analysis:</strong> Ukraine is enjoying a lot of propaganda success with its Turkish-designed TB2s, as Russia plays catchup","Shot after shot pounded into the Russian missile battery hidden by the lighthouse on Snake Island, a Black Sea rock 22 miles (35km) from the Ukrainian coast. The edited video, released by the Ukrainian military, showed the strike and its aftermath – all taken from a Turkish-designed Bayraktar TB2 drone. Until then, evidence of the TB2 – a remotely piloted killer drone with a range of up to 190 miles – had largely disappeared from the conflict. The assumption was that the two dozen or so that Ukraine had bought from Turkey had been shot down and Ankara, not wanting to upset Russia, had declined to supply more. Yet the battle for control of Snake Island suggested the picture had changed. A day later, another TB2 video, accompanied by the pumping music typical of these propaganda releases, showed a landing craft being destroyed; a day after that, the downing of an Mi-8 helicopter as Russian troops were disembarking. Death from a distance, shown on social media video. An aviation analyst, Amelia Smith, spotted that one of the drone videos indicated the drone had a new registration: T253 – not seen in Ukraine before. It had been spotted being tested in late March around the manufacturer’s test facility in Turkey, suggesting it was newly supplied, perhaps part of a new batch. One week on, Russia said it had shot down nine TB2 drones, which cost somewhere between $1m (£820,000) to $2m each, plus several other uncrewed aircraft, in the battle for Snake Island. While that claim is hard to verify, control of the territory is still being contested, for all the videoed strikes. The TB2s are clearly militarily effective – and are used for all their propaganda worth. But it is not obvious they are militarily decisive. The point is not lost on Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who said in April: “With all due respect to Bayraktar, and to any hardware, I will tell you, frankly, this is a different war.” The 11-week conflict – in which Russia’s invasion has stalled after capturing most of the south coast and some of the east of the country – has become, since the abortive attempt to take Kyiv, largely a battle of tanks and artillery in which both sides exchange heavy and often unguided fire as they fight over increasingly small amounts of territory. This is not to suggest that drones are irrelevant. However, it reflects in part the reality that for both sides, the larger armed drones – the TB2s on the Ukrainian side and Russia’s nearest equivalent, the Orion drone - have not been present in large numbers and once eliminated are not easy to replace. Sam Bendett, a drone expert with the US Center for Naval Analyses thinktank, said the Ukrainian military had taken advantage of the fact that Russia did not control all the airspace and that it did not have persistent electronic warfare defences “with some very accurate and significant strikes”. But he added: “What is needed from their perspective is to do so on a much larger scale.” Russia knew it needed to counter the TB2 from the 2020 war between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Azerbaijan used Turkish drones to knock out Armenia’s Russian-designed tanks and gain a decisive advantage. Moscow had long lagged behind in drone technology, said Douglas Barrie, an aerospace analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “Russia is having to play catchup. They have underinvested in this area since the early 1990s, just as they underinvested across the board,” he said. Moscow started deploying Orion combat drones in Ukraine in March, followed almost immediately by reports one had been shot down. “They went into the war with a limited supply, the consequence of decisions made years ago; perhaps with two or three dozen Orions, instead of having a larger number,” Bendett said. Ukraine has wasted little opportunity in trying to demonstrate the homespun nature of Russian drones: videos of a downed Orlan 10 reconnaissance drone being taken apart show it relies on a consumer Canon DSLR camera with key buttons glued into position and, for its fuel tank, parts of a water bottle, including the screw-on top. “No original part” was made in Russia, the Ukrainians conclude in the video, and the true cost of the drone was estimated at $3,000 rather than the $80,000 to $120,000 official cost. It is probably a reasonable estimate, but in reality, even Turkish TB2 drones have relied on off-the-shelf components to keep costs down and the pace of manufacturing up. Meanwhile, as the war becomes increasingly attritional, and armed drones are knocked out of the sky, new drones are coming to the fore. The US has agreed to supply to Ukraine at least 700 of the less sophisticated single-use, or kamikaze, Switchblade 300 and 600 drones, with a range of six or 25 miles, loitering munitions that can hang in the sky and smash down, with fearful effect on their target. Switchblades have started to arrive on the frontline – a Ukrainian video from a week ago purports to show a Russian position struck from above, followed by soldiers fleeing in terror. But again, although the number of kamikaze drones appears large, the stockpile may be quickly depleted as the war continues. Prof Peter Lee, a drones expert at Portsmouth University, said that in a war where “no side has control of the air” the most significant use of drones has instead been for “intelligence gathering and situational awareness – exactly what aircraft were first used for 100 years ago”. Each side has made heavy use of simple, commercially available drones for reconnaissance, with videos frequently released into the public domain, such as an edited montage of footage of a Russian armoured column being ambushed in Brovary, east of Kyiv, in March. Drone footage of artillery shelling, attacks on armoured vehicles and other fighting on both sides have become a routine feature of the war. Such has been the demand for simple camera drones that China’s DJI, the world’s largest manufacturer, chose in April to suspend sales of its easy-to-use drones to Ukraine and, more surprisingly, to Russia – although it is unclear if the ban will have a meaningful effect. One expert has estimated that Ukraine is operating as many as 6,000 reconnaissance drones on the battlefield. “Drones are not a war-winning technology,” Lee said. “But they are a war-enabling technology, and what we have seen is Ukraine responding in a quicker and more agile way.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine war deepens China’s mistrust of the west,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/ukraine-war-deepens-chinas-mistrust-of-the-west,2022-06-06T09:13:54Z,Analysis: the conflict in Europe has entrenched the differences between Beijing and the US and its allies,"More than 100 days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s strategic assessment of the conflict is becoming clearer: it does not wish to be cast in the same light as Russia, but the war has deepened Beijing’s mistrust of the west. In Beijing’s view, the pessimism has been exacerbated by the US and its allies’ recent efforts, for example, to help Taiwan increase its international recognition. On Monday last week, Beijing made the second-largest incursion into Taiwan’s air defence zone this year with Taipei reporting 30 jets entering the area, including more than 20 fighters. China’s tone has also evolved from sitting on the fence to outright defensive. When the conflict first began in late February, Beijing tried to be “impartial”, but in the last few weeks, it deployed the language that directly confronted the US-led Nato and western sanctions, calling them “financial terrorism” and “economic weaponisation”. “The war in Ukraine has intensified the confrontation between the US and China,” said Prof Yan Xuetong, director of the institute of international studies at Tsinghua University in Beijing, in a recent talk. “It [also] further highlighted the differences between us [China] and France, Germany, Britain and Japan.” Yan also detected that the emerging bipolarisation in the new world order was not tilting in China’s favour. And his view was widely shared by Chinese scholars and public intellectuals, said Liu Yawei, senior adviser on China at the Atlanta-based Carter Centre. China’s leadership has sensed it, too. Early in May, the Guardian reported that shortly after the invasion began, Beijing had ordered a comprehensive “stress test” to study the implications of a possible Russia-style sanctioning by the west. Several key government agencies – from banking regulation to international trade – have been asked to come up with responses if the west imposed the same embargos on China. Domestically, debates over Ukraine have endured, in spite of censorship. “China not only cannot stand with Putin, but also should take concrete actions to prevent Putin’s possible adventures,” warned Hu Wei, vice-chairman of the Public Policy Research Center of the Counselor’s Office of the State Council in Beijing in March, in rare dissent against the official view. But the article was quickly taken down. While Beijing’s relationship with Moscow continues to evolve, despite their friendly public pledges such as “‘no limits’ partnership”, in a strategically anxious China today, voices such as Hu’s are often met with fierce criticism. Zhao Tong, a Beijing-based senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, observed: “Liberal voices within China have become less capable to counterbalance against the growing influence of hardline views that see China’s future as resting with working with other like-minded countries to more proactively push back against the US-led western order, norms, and values.” One of the reasons for this dynamic, according to Liu, was that opponents saw “strong evidence that even if China had supported the US in condemning Russia and sanctioning it, the fundamentals in the bilateral relationship would not change”. He pointed out that many saw last week’s speech by Antony Blinken, in which the secretary of state said Washington would “shape the strategic environment around Beijing”, as further evidence that the American state has determined to treat China as its ultimate challenger. And until recent weeks, public opinion seemed to be on Beijing’s side, too. According to a poll by the Carter Centre’s US-China Perception Monitor initiative, 75% of Chinese respondents agreed that supporting Russia was in China’s national interest, although roughly 60% of the surveyed also expected China to play a role in mediating an end to the war. The public’s overwhelming support for Beijing’s stance – which some called “pro-Russian neutrality” – has made an immediate change of course more difficult, even if senior officials were thinking about a possible adjustment at some point, Zhao said. The perception gap in Beijing is stark to many westerners. There is also a growing view among hawks that the conflict is a “proxy war” between Russia and the western powers. Additionally, Beijing thinks the US would ultimately glean the benefits from Ukraine’s misfortune – an assumption that has been heightened by the collapse of mutual trust in recent years. “Russia-Ukraine conflict is Putin’s ‘counter-strike’ against the US-led west’s plan to dismember Russia,” declared Qiu Wenping of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, a government thinktank, repeating Moscow’s talking points in a recent TV discussion. “China is in a position that is somewhat comparable to Russia’s … The US is clearly manipulating the Taiwan issue and constantly fanning the flames in order to dismember China by creating a Ukraine of the Orient.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only diplomacy can end Ukraine war, says Volodymyr Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/only-diplomacy-can-end-ukraine-war-volodymyr-zelenskiy,2022-05-21T11:29:35Z,Country’s president emphasises need for talks to resume with Russia after previous negotiations stalled,"Ukraine’s president has said the war can only be resolved through diplomacy, despite the current suspension of negotiations. “Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview with a Ukrainian television channel. “Under what format I don’t know – with intermediaries, without them, in a broader group, at the presidential level. But the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “There are things that can only be reached at the negotiating table. We want everything to return [to as it was before] but Russia does not want that,” he said. The last talks between the two sides took place on 22 April, according to Russian news agencies. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of not wanting to continue talks to end the fighting. During the interview, Zelenskiy spoke of a document about security guarantees for his country. Although a bilateral discussion would be held with Russia at the same time, the document would be signed by “friends and partners of Ukraine, without Moscow”, he added. However, Zelenskiy warned that the precondition for resuming the negotiations with Moscow was that Russia does not kill Ukrainian troops who defended the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. “The most important thing for me is to save the maximum number of people and soldiers,” he said. On Friday, Russia claimed to have taken full control of the besieged city of Mariupol – in what has been described as Moscow’s biggest prize since it invaded Ukraine in February – after the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks surrendered. The move marked an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in the city. “Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” Russia’s defence ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered. Hours before the Russian announcement, Zelenskiy said the defenders had been told by Ukraine’s military that they could get out and save their lives and would most probably all leave in the coming days. In a live video posted on Telegram, Denys Prokopenko, the commander of the Azov regiment that has led the defence of the factory, said only the dead remained. “The higher military command has given the order to save the lives of the soldiers of our garrison and to stop defending the city,” he said. “I now hope that soon the families and all of Ukraine will be able to bury their fighters with honours.” Ukraine hopes to exchange the surrendering Azovstal soldiers for Russian prisoners. But in Donetsk, pro-Kremlin authorities are threatening to put some of them on trial. Meanwhile on Saturday, Russia’s Gazprom halted gas exports to neighbouring Finland, the Finnish gas system operator said, after Helsinki angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership. Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied to join Nato, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Moscow warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”. The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but the fuel only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption. On the ground in Ukraine, fierce fighting continued in the eastern region of Donbas, where, Zelenskiy said, Russian troops “completely ruined the cities of Rubizhne, Volnovakha, just as they did Mariupol”, adding that the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”. And while the US Congress this week approved a $40bn (£32bn) aid package, including funds to enhance Ukraine’s armoured vehicle fleet and air defence system, Moscow claimed on Saturday it had destroyed a large shipment of US and European weapons, using sea-launched Kalibr cruise missiles that allegedly hit Malin railway station, north-west of Kyiv, in the Zhytomyr region. There was no Ukrainian or independent confirmation as to the success of the strike.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine war weighs heavy as apocalyptic mood shrouds Davos,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/25/ukraine-war-weighs-heavy-as-apocalyptic-mood-shrouds-davos,2022-05-25T14:58:59Z,"From a warning of third world war to global stagflation or depression, gathering is unsurprisingly sombre","The impact of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine dominated a delayed and slimmed-down World Economic Forum this year but it took George Soros to articulate what many of those making the trip to the Swiss Alps had been thinking. Davos would not be Davos without a broadside from the 91-year-old philanthropist and former speculator, but the conflict in eastern Europe prompted his most apocalyptic warning yet. “The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said. Others were voicing similarly dark thoughts – some publicly, some privately. So much so, that at times it felt as if the meeting was taking place not in May 2022 but in July 1914 or August 1939, times past when the world has stood on the brink of the precipice. The historian Adam Tooze said: “The war dominates everything. The nuclear escalation risk is not being priced in. This doesn’t feel like cold war. It’s hard to think of a time during the cold war when the US openly announced its policy was to eliminate the capacity of Russia to take independent military action.” Similar sentiments were expressed by a senior policymaker who pointed out that a global pandemic had been unthinkable in early 2020, a near-coup in Washington incited by Donald Trump had been unthinkable in January 2021 and a war between Russia and Ukraine had been unthinkable at the start of 2022. “Why should we think the unthinkable ended with the start of the war?” Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of Nato, said the west’s military build-up in eastern Europe was designed to deter Vladimir Putin rather than provoke him, but even if Russia resists the temptation to push the nuclear button it has other ways to escalate the conflict. Solidarity with Ukraine was total. In previous years, one of the hottest ticket at Davos was an invite to the champagne and caviar bashes thrown at the Russia House on the Promenade. This year, no Russians were invited and the party premises became the “Russia War Crimes House”, where Ukraine displayed evidence of atrocities committed since the start of the invasion. But solidarity with Ukraine comes at a cost, as was clear from many of the sessions. It was taken as read that the war would be bad for the global economy, with the only dispute about exactly how bad. Estimates ranged all the way from a mild dose of stagflation through to Soros’s prediction of a depression. There was no sense in Davos of the west easing its sanctions on Russia but fears over the health of the global economy reflected the fact that Putin has economic weapons at his disposal – energy and food – and has already shown a willingness to use both of them. The Kremlin has cut off gas supplies to Poland, Bulgaria and Finland, and the European Union expects to be hit by a blanket embargo this winter, assuming there is no early end to the war. Few in Davos believe peace will have broken out by the time the WEF’s annual meeting reverts to its normal mid-January slot in 2023. “We can handle it,” one European policymaker said, “but it is not going to be easy.” Higher gas and petrol prices since the start of the war three months ago have added to inflationary pressures in many countries, prompting central banks to raise interest rates. But for those attending Davos – and there were fewer of them than usual – it was food not energy that was the more immediate threat. Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Putin was “weaponising food” by seizing Ukraine’s grain and blockading Black Sea ports. Kristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund,, said: “The price of food is going up, up, up, up. We can shrink our use of petrol when growth slows down but we have to eat every day.” Achim Steiner, administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP), said developing countries were faced with a triple threat: a food crisis, a fuel crisis and a financial crisis. Sri Lanka was the first country to default on its debts since the start of the war, but the IMF fears it will not be the last to require its financial help. It wasn’t supposed to be like this. After two years dominated by the global pandemic, this was billed as the Davos where the global movers and shakers breathed a sigh of relief and planned for a sustainable recovery. The idea was to harness new technology to forge a green future in which growth would be consistent with tackling climate change. In reality, the effects of the pandemic have lingered on, with China’s lockdowns to combat the spread of Covid-19 weakening global demand and adding to bottlenecks. Meanwhile, countries starved of Russian gas are turning to coal as a substitute. As one climate change expert put it, countries made commitments at the Cop26 conference in Glasgow to limit the rise in global temperature to 1.8C but had yet to turn pledges into action. As things stood, temperatures would rise by 4C. In the longer term, the hope in Davos was that the war, and the vulnerability to Russia it has exposed, would hasten the transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. The prospect of countries accelerating progress to net zero provided a rare glimpse of sunshine in what has otherwise been a sombre affair.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
War leads to surge in money transfers to Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/11/ukraine-russia-war-money-transfers-surge-world-bank,2022-05-11T14:51:46Z,"As more Ukrainians abroad send funds home, World Bank expects remittances to Russia-linked countries to fall","The war in Ukraine is fuelling a surge in money transfers to the country as migrant workers and refugees fleeing the conflict scramble to send financial support back to their families. The World Bank said remittances to Ukraine from other countries were expected to rise by more than 20% this year, driven by Ukrainians abroad transferring funds back to friends and family facing the severe economic impact of the Russian invasion. Meanwhile the flow of funds from Russia to countries in central Asia, from where it draws millions of migrant workers, is expected to suffer a dramatic decline as western sanctions plunge Russia into the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Remittances are payments sent from one person to another in a different country, typically by migrant workers sending money back to their families. The World Bank said the surge in cross-border payments to Ukraine mirrored a trend typically seen after natural disasters, as refugees and migrant workers scrambled to support friends and family. The biggest increases came from Poland, the largest recipient of Ukrainian migrant workers, and, to some extent, the US. Even before Vladimir Putin’s invasion Ukraine was the biggest recipient of remittances in Europe and central Asia, with record-high inflows of $18.2bn (£14.8bn) last year. However, money flows are expected to surge in 2022 by 20% from the level in 2021 due to the impact of war. The World Bank said total global remittance flows to low-and middle-income countries were expected to grow by 4.2% to reach $630bn this year. While Ukraine is expected to record a surge, the organisation said countries with close ties to Russia would probably suffer a sharp fall in remittances due to the impact of western sanctions on the country’s economy – forecast to shrink by 11% this year – and ability of Russians to send money abroad. Furthermore, with the country’s biggest banks limited from accessing the global financial system, remittance outflows from Russia could plummet by 40%. The World Bank said this would have a damaging impact on central Asian countries with exceptionally tight links to Russia that rely on remittances for a large share of overseas currency earnings, including Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, Armenia and Uzbekistan. In Kyrgyzstan, where 82% of remittances originated in Russia in 2021, flows this year are likely to plunge by 32%, compared with an original projected growth rate of 3%. Major payments companies including Visa and Mastercard have blocked services in Russia, while providers such as PayPal and Revolut have waived fees on transfers to Ukraine in support of the country. The World Bank said average remittance fees for sending funds to Ukraine ranged between 4.7% in Hungary to 7% in the Czech Republic last year, while steps to reduce charges by 2 percentage points could save Ukrainian migrants over $400m. The institution said rising food, fertiliser and oil prices triggered by Russia’s invasion were likely to increase risks to food security and exacerbate poverty in many low-income countries around the world. Michal Rutkowski, global director of the social protection and jobs global practice at the World Bank, said: “The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered large-scale humanitarian, migration and refugee crises and risks for a global economy that is still dealing with the impact of the Covid pandemic. “Boosting social protection programmes to protect the most vulnerable, including Ukrainians and families in central Asia, as well as those affected by the war’s economic impact, is a key priority to protect people from the threats of food insecurity and rising poverty.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Trial by fire: Ukraine war becomes gruelling artillery duel,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/gas-masks-medics-ukraine-choking-troops-sloviansk,2022-05-13T16:21:20Z,"As troops in mazes of trenches pound each other with shells, the terror of war draws closer to the city of Sloviansk","The call came at about midday on Wednesday. There had been “chemical poisoning” after a blast and patients needed collecting. Fears of a Russian chemical weapons attack have haunted Ukraine almost since the war began, and as the volunteer medics in Sloviansk pulled on the ageing gas masks and plastic overalls that were their only protection, they wondered if this was it. They set off anyway, inured to personal risks after weeks of driving through shelling to patch up the men and women injured on one of the most intensely fought-over sections of the frontline. “We got a call saying there was a yellow-brown cloud after the hit and yellow-white flakes in the air like snow. The soldiers immediately started having breathing problems,” said Vit, a paramedic who asked to go only by his nickname, which refers to his peacetime role as mayor of a small town. He was worried about being captured and tortured by Russian troops who were just a few miles away. The ambulance team listened to the warning and then went to get the choking soldiers. Like the troops they support, they are supplementing limited, outdated equipment with courage and determination. After dropping off their patient, who had gone into spasms in the ambulance, they were told the gas came not from chemical weapons but from a chemical plant that had been hit by Russian munitions. But if the fear of one particular horror was put on hold for a moment, the other terrors of this war are drawing closer to this city in Donbas, less than 20 miles behind the frontline. “You can win one battle then the next day there are more troops, sent back to the same place,” said Vlad, a veteran who signed up to fight again after the February invasion, and now a patient in a Sloviansk clinic. He asked not to give his last name because his family were in areas occupied by Russian troops and he feared they could face reprisals. His cheek shook when he talked about his children, and his fight was personal as well as patriotic. This corner of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions is one of the few areas where Moscow’s army is still consistently gaining ground, even if their advance proceeds at a snail’s pace and recent attempts to bridge a strategically important river ended in a rout. Ukraine has followed its victory in Kyiv by pushing Russian artillery back from within firing range of the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv. A senior general said this week that Moscow’s troops had been put on the defensive on several other key fronts, including along the Black Sea coast, and ministers have started talking about an offensive to take back territory lost in 2014. But on the rolling steppe here, geography denies the Ukrainian military some of the advantages that allowed its forces to humble Moscow’s troops around the capital. Soldiers rarely get close enough to fight face to face or deploy the western anti-tank missiles that helped them save Kyiv. Instead, their artillery guns face off across vast open fields, dug in with mazes of trenches that could have come from the last century, pounding each other with shells while jets occasionally scream overhead. Many Russian guns shoot further than the ones Ukraine’s military had at the start of the war, so while they wait for western weapons with a longer range – such as the M777 howitzers dispatched by the US and just starting to arrive at the frontline – they must live under constant bombardment. “Positions where the Ukrainian army are staying are bombed with artillery, missiles and by air constantly, every day, so it gets to the point where there is nothing to hold on to in these points, that is part of the problem,” said Serhiy Haidai, the head of the military administration for the Luhansk region. “The attacks with tanks we fight off, but we have no possibility to counter the artillery. That’s why unfortunately we have to retreat. We have been holding for three months already, and Russians couldn’t get through this small area. I hope the Ukrainian army will still hold these positions and – with the weapons we are waiting for – can even go into counterattack.” After the humiliation of defeat near Kyiv, Vladimir Putin doubled down instead on the battle for the eastern Donbas region, where proxy forces have held ground seized in 2014 for eight years, claiming “independence” from Kyiv that provided a pretext for the wider invasion. The ruthless bombardment they unleashed in pursuit of this goal shows in the type and scale of the injuries treated at the Sloviansk clinic, said Svitlana Druzenko, a paediatric trauma specialist and director of the all-volunteer Priogov mobile hospital, which treated the chemical poisoning victims. She spent the first month of the war evacuating injured people from near frontlines in the capital. “In Kyiv and the Kyiv region we didn’t see such a large amount of wounded soldiers as here,” she said. “Here we also see a lot more severe injuries: torn-off arms and legs, or we must do an amputation, and we get a lot of head trauma. The main injuries here are from blasts. Near Kyiv we also saw more gunshot wounds.” Every day they collect casualties from the frontlines, or civilians from bombed-out homes, and stabilise them and send them on to safer hospitals. They know they are targets, because the Ukrainian government says more than 500 healthcare centres have been hit. Their ambulances have been shelled – they are fundraising for armoured vehicles – they have been tracked by Russian jets, and the towns where they are based have been hit repeatedly. Some of the western weapons that Ukraine hopes will change the course of the war have started arriving on the battlefield, including M777 guns, stingers and more anti-tank Javelins, Haidai said. The head of a national guard unit that helps to protect the medics this week showed off the remains of a Russian Orlan drone that he was sending to Kyiv for analysis. His fighters had shot down the aircraft, which costs about $100,000 (£82,000), with a US stinger missile, he said. The weapons influx was still not enough, Haidai said, but he hoped the shipments would speed up and he took heart from the Ukrainian military’s continued skill in outmanoeuvring Russia when artillery was not holding troops back. In the last week Russia had twice tried to build a pontoon bridge to bring tanks and weapons round for the siege of Severodonetsk. It was bombed the first time by Ukraine, leading to a large loss of weapons and lives, and then Russian engineers started again in the same place. “What’s interesting about this bridge is the Russian tactics: they built it, tried to bring over the weapons, we got them, and they built it again and we got them again,” he said. “It shows they are trying to win not with military intelligence but with sheer force of numbers.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first war crimes trial in Ukraine begins | First Thing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/13/first-thing-the-first-war-crimes-trial-in-ukraine-begins,2022-05-13T11:16:36Z,"Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is charged with murdering a 62-year-old Ukrainian civilian","Good morning. For the first time since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, a court in Kyiv will hear a war crime trial – of a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting the unarmed man after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Shysimarin, who is in custody, is also accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days, including an in-absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, who is accused of breaking into a house in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife in front of her child. The trial comes as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato, with Sweden moving to follow suit. In the US, $40bn in aid for Ukraine has been held up because of one libertarian lawmaker, Rand Paul. Even in California, an abortion ‘safe haven’, the system is strained In the aftermath of the leak of a supreme court document foretelling the end to federal abortion protections, Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, vowed that his state “will not stand idly by”. He proposed a new reproductive health spending plan, dedicating an additional $57m to prepare for an influx of people seeking abortions from other states. But while no other state does more to protect abortion access, abortions have long been inaccessible for many in California: 40% of counties in the state have no clinics providing abortions. Eleven people killed as boat capsizes near Puerto Rico Eleven people were killed and dozens were rescued after a boat capsized near Puerto Rico yesterday – the latest in a string of incidents across the region as people from Haiti and the Dominican Republic flee violence and poverty. Authorities said people on the boat were believed to be migrants. At least eight Haitians were taken to the hospital. What you need to know about the US baby formula shortage Stores around the country are running out of baby formula because of a combination of short- and long-term problems that have affected most of the larger US brands. Here’s everything you need to know about why it’s happening and what to do if you can’t find any in your local stores. US secretly issued subpoena to access Guardian reporter’s phone records The US justice department secretly issued a subpoena to gain access to details of the phone account of Stephanie Kirchgaessner, the Guardian’s investigations correspondent in Washington, in an attempt to uncover the source of articles about a review of family separation at the southern border conducted by the Department of Justice’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz. The move was carried out without notifying the newspaper or its reporter. Katharine Viner, the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, decried the action as “an egregious example of infringement on press freedom and public interest journalism by the US Department of Justice”. In other news … The House select committee investigating the 6 January attack on the US Capitol has issued unprecedented subpoenas to five Republican members of Congress. Nearly 150 people have been killed in gang battles in Haiti in an increase in gun violence that has paralysed much of the capital, Port-au-Prince. Cuban rescue workers recovered the body of the 45th and last person believed missing after an explosion at a luxury hotel in Havana. The Grammy-award winning country musician Naomi Judd died last month by suicide, her daughter Ashley Judd confirmed yesterday. Stat of the day: a dozen oil refineries exceeded the federal limit on average benzene emissions last year Benzene is a highly toxic carcinogen that is volatile when exposed to air. New analysis by the Environmental Integrity Project revealed yesterday that 12 US oil refineries last year exceeded the federal limit on average benzene emissions: five in Texas, four in Louisiana, and one each in Pennsylvania, Indiana and the US Virgin Islands. Don’t miss this: the 61-year-old Ukrainian who walked 140 miles to safety from Mariupol Igor Pedin made a perilous 140-mile journey through the besieged port city of Mariupol, into Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia – all while keeping Zhu-Zhu, his nine-year-old mongrel terrier, safe. Climate check: woman power In the past years, Mexico has felt the full impact of the climate crisis. But across the country, women are leading projects to build water harvesting and filtration tanks, helping their communities conserve what little rain there is, and make it safe to drink.

Russian troops pound Donbas as Ukraine war enters 100th day,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/russian-troops-pound-donbas-region-as-ukraine-war-enters-100th-day,2022-06-03T14:29:22Z,Moscow has seized about a fifth of Ukrainian territory since its invasion and vows to continue ‘until all goals are achieved’,"Ukraine will fight off Russia’s invasion, its president has said, while the Kremlin pledged to persist until “all our goals have been achieved” as Moscow’s war entered its 100th day with Russian troops pounding the Donbas region. “Victory shall be ours,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video featuring the same key ministers and advisers who appeared with him in a defiant broadcast on 24 February, the day his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, launched his unprovoked assault. “Our team is much bigger,” Zelenskiy declared on Friday. “The armed forces of Ukraine are here. Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days already … Glory to Ukraine.” In Moscow, the Kremlin’s official spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, insisted that “certain results have been achieved” by Russia’s “military operation”, pointing to what he called the “liberation” of some areas from the “pro-Nazi armed forces of Ukraine”. Tens of thousands have been killed, millions sent fleeing and whole towns reduced to rubble since the start of the invasion, with Russia’s forces – repelled from around the capital, Kyiv, by fierce Ukrainian resistance – now focused on capturing the east. Moscow has seized about a fifth of Ukrainian territory, tripling the land under its occupation since 2014 when it seized Crimea and parts of Donbas, where some of the fiercest fighting is centred on the industrial city of Sieverodonetsk. “This war has and will have no winner,” said Amin Awad, the UN’s assistant secretary-general and crisis coordinator for Ukraine. “Rather, we have witnessed for 100 days what is lost: lives, homes, jobs and prospects.” Zelenskiy’s office said fierce fighting continued in the city centre on Friday, with the invading forces “shelling civilian infrastructure and Ukrainian military”. The Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, said Russian troops were “levelling everything”. Accusing Moscow’s forces of destroying hospitals, schools and roads, he said the resistance was confined now to about a fifth of the city, with Ukrainian troops still holding a sprawling steel and chemical works in an industrial zone, Gaidai said. The situation in Lysychansk, Severodonetsk’s twin city across the river Donets, also looked bad, with about 60% of infrastructure and housing destroyed and internet, mobile phone and gas services all out of operation, Oleksandr Zaika, head of the city’s military-civil administration, said. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleskiy Reznikov, said Ukrainian forces had some success in Sievierodonetsk overnight, adding that artillery crews were already training on new Himars and MLRS rocket systems pledged earlier this week by the US and Britain. Washington had said this week it expected around three weeks of training would be needed before Ukraine can begin using the rockets, which could target Russian rear supply lines and help negate Russia’s artillery fire-power advantage at the front. Russia’s recent massive assault in the east has been one of the deadliest phases of the war for both sides, with Moscow making slow but steady progress, squeezing the defenders inside a pocket in the Luhansk and Donetsk regions that make up Donbas. Amid rising fears of a global food crisis, the head of the African Union, Senegalese president, Macky Sall, met Putin in the Black Sea port of Sochi to raise concerns about the war’s consequences for the continent. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, while Russia is also a big fertiliser exporter, and Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil. Ukrainian exports have been halted by a Russian blockade of the country’s ports, while western sanctions have cut off access to Russian output. Sall asked Putin to “be aware that our countries, even if they are far from the theatre, are victims on an economic level” of the conflict. “That is really creating serious threats to the food security of the continent,” Sall said. Putin did not mention grain supplies to reporters but said Russia was “always on Africa’s side” and was now keen to improve cooperation. “We place great importance on our relations with African counties,” he said. Turkey said it expected progress on a plan to unlock grain exports from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports when Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, visits the country next week. Both Moscow and Kyiv want a solution to the crisis, a Turkish official said. Though hurdles remain – such as payment mechanisms for the agricultural products, and mines floating in the Black Sea – the official said Moscow could “take further positive steps” after it said on Thursday it was open to the plan. Turkey has already said it is ready to take on a role within an “observation mechanism” if a deal is reached, potentially involving a Turkish naval escort for tankers leaving Ukraine. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, hosts his Russian counterpart for talks on the plan on 8 June. Belarus was ready to allow the transit of Ukraine’s grain to Baltic Sea ports if it is also allowed to ship Belarusian goods from those ports, the country’s leader, Alexander Lukashenko, was quoted as saying. Exports from Ukraine via Belarus have been one of the options in discussions led by the UN. In a phone call with UN secretary-general António Guterres on Friday, Lukashenko said Belarus was ready to free up needed capacity on its railway for Ukraine’s grain, and proposed organising talks between Belarus, Ukraine and other countries ready to provide access to their ports. On the defence and security front, Turkey said progress on Finland and Sweden’s applications to join Nato – which Ankara is blocking – before an alliance summit in Madrid later this month would depend on their response to Turkey’s demands. Turkey accuses the two Nordic countries of supporting and harbouring Kurdish militants and other groups it deems terrorists, and says it has not yet received a satisfactory response from Stockholm or Helsinki. “Nato is not a tourism or economic alliance; it is a security alliance, which means that it must provide security to all its members equally and fairly,” said Ibrahim Kalin, spokesperson and chief foreign policy adviser to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lucky Breaks by Yevgenia Belorusets review – war stories from Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jun/03/lucky-breaks-by-yevgenia-belorusets-review-war-stories-from-ukraine,2022-06-03T06:30:00Z,"Infused with magic and black humour, these fables of women affected by Russian aggression have accrued an unsettling timeliness","Yevgenia Belorusets is a Ukrainian photographer, writer and artist. For more than a decade, she has been documenting the ominous splits in the social fabric of her country. Her installations and photographic work have showcased the lives of female factory workers, impoverished villagers in western Ukraine, the country’s persecuted Roma citizens, and its LGBTQ community. In 2012 an exhibition in Kyiv of her photographs about non-traditional families was vandalised by rightwing activists. Since 2014, she has worked and reported from the Russian-backed breakaway enclaves around Luhansk and Donetsk, where a conflict was unfolding to the almost complete indifference of the outside world. Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, all that has changed. A previously obscure war and its attendant disputes over language, nationhood, the Orthodox church and the meaning of fascism have become matters of existential concern for our entire planet. These events have given Belorusets’ collection of short stories an unsettling timeliness. Most of its 30 tales concern women affected by the war in eastern Ukraine, fleeing conflict and trying to make new lives in unfamiliar cities. Like Belorusets’ photographs, some of which are included in the book, each of the stories is a snapshot of a character in a post-Soviet landscape, burdened with the weight of a complex history that’s implied, but never stated outright. Infused with magic, absurdity and black humour, many of the stories are reminiscent of fairytales. “Once upon a time there lived a woman who was kind, appealing and pleasant in every respect,” is the opening of A Needle in a Nightshirt. In The Woman Who Caught Babies in a Mitt we meet a witchy midwife who terrorises Kharkiv with her spells. The central character of Transformations has a weirdly banal magical gift: she can change household objects into one another, so a pot of porridge becomes a flower and a teapot turns into a fan. In Three Songs of Lamentation a conscientious caregiver wrestles the angel of death for the life of an elderly neighbour. Other stories are more overtly satirical. A Woman Finds a Job takes aim at sexism in the workplace. In Two Women on the Airplane Stairs we eavesdrop as two rich Ukrainian women discuss spiritual development while queueing for first-class aeroplane seats. In The Address a talk by a successful businesswoman descends into a tirade as she berates her fellow citizens for being losers. Mordant, funny, weird and surprising, few of the stories are more than a couple of pages long. As the collection’s translator, Eugene Ostashevsky, explains in an afterword, Belorusets is working in the absurdist tradition of Nikolai Gogol and Daniil Kharms, whose surreal microfictions were his private antidote to the dehumanising ideology of Stalinism. In Belorusets’ work, too, magic and absurdity are shadows cast by an ominous real world. The intrusion of current events constantly disrupts the fable-like qualities. An archetypal deep dark forest is suddenly logged to near-extinction. The heroine of The Florist seems to be set up as the protagonist of a romance, only to vanish from the plot halfway through. Far from being in a timeless fairytale, she is in Donetsk in 2014 at the moment that war breaks out. In A Needle in a Nightshirt, the flawless heroine leaves a deadly object in the breast of a nightshirt that seems fated to bring disaster. In many of the stories, the characters’ irrational beliefs and claimed powers appear to be the products of war-related trauma. And the stories’ curious vanishings and sudden relocations often make sense in the light of the conflict that is taking place just out of sight. In Elena and My Sister, family members become estranged from one another for reasons that are never made explicit, but it seems clear that they have fallen out over their support for the Russian-backed separatists. Often the stories pose a question whose answer the reader struggles to infer. In March 8: The Woman Who Could Not Walk, set in 2016, the narrator encounters a woman in central Kyiv who has suddenly lost the power of her legs. The cause of her disability is never made clear. The woman hints to the narrator that it’s related to a secret she has, but this secret is never shared. The story ends without any conventional resolution. Deprived of a way to make the story meaningful, the reader naturally tries to supply one. Is the disability psychosomatic, and the woman a trauma survivor? Or is the woman, as she seems to imply herself, an allegorical figure, a symbol of a nation that has yet to find its feet? “I am a living monument,” she tells the narrator, as they sit in Independence Square, the centre of Ukraine’s so-called revolution of dignity in 2014. “She maintained that events of historical importance, so to speak, could be taking place all around her, but she would remain sitting on the bench and every so often try to rise to her feet with a triumphant smile.” Narrator and reader are left scratching their heads over the encounter. Belorusets sets out the reasons for her authorial reticence in a pair of prefaces. The stories are concerned, she explains, “with the insignificant and the small, the accidental, the superfluous, the repressed”. By design, they remain enigmatic. “The voices of different people resonate and clash … Their interlocked coexistence doesn’t allow any one idea, any one voice – especially the author’s – to dominate.” I really enjoyed these stories, the sharpness and clarity of their observations, their dark humour, and the glimpses they give of an unfamiliar world. Regrettably, aspects of them feel already dated. The tales belong to a time when the fighting on Ukraine’s borders had a surreal, unfathomable quality. Six months ago, this book would have been a timely reminder of an intractable regional problem that didn’t much concern us. The war seemed fated to rumble on for ever at a low pitch, and we might have allowed ourselves a dark chuckle at the characters in The Stars who think they are being shelled by the Canadians. That joke is less funny now. The war has entered a vicious, dynamic phase and the book pricks our consciences for having ignored it for so long. • Lucky Breaks by Yevgenia Belorusets, translated by Eugene Ostashevsky, is published by Pushkin (£9.99).

EU growth forecast cut as war in Ukraine fuels inflation,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/eu-growth-forecast-cut-inflation-ukraine-war-please,2022-05-16T12:48:07Z,"European Commission downgrades growth prospects from 4% to 2.7%, while economy slows rapidly in China","The growth prospects for the EU have been revised sharply downwards after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put paid to hopes of a strong and sustained recovery from Covid-19 over the next two years. Rocketing energy prices as a result of the conflict have pushed up inflation and increased economic headwinds during a period when they were expected to subside, the European Commission said in its latest forecasts. The commission now expects 2022 growth of 2.7% in the 19-nation euro area and the broader 27-country EU – down from a forecast of 4% three months ago. But it said a complete cut in supplies of Russian gas would shave a further 2.5 points off growth – bringing the economy to a virtual standstill this year. With many European countries heavily dependent on Russian energy exports, growth is expected to slow further next year – to 2.3% in the EU and the euro area. Inflation, already at its highest in the euro area since the creation of the single currency more than two decades ago, is expected to average 6.1% this year, up from 3.5% in the last set of commission predictions in February. EU-wide inflation is expected to average 6.8%. Inflation would average close to 10% in the event of a Russian gas ban, the commission said. “The outlook for the EU economy before the outbreak of the war was for a prolonged and robust expansion. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed new challenges, just as the Uunion had recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic,” it said in a statement. The fastest growing countries in the EU this year are expected to be Portugal, at 5.8%, and Ireland (5.4%), with Estonia (1%), Germany and Finland (both 1.6%) forecast to be the weakest. Valdis Dombrovskis, an EU trade commissioner, said: “There is no doubt that the EU economy is going through a challenging period due to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and we have downgraded our forecast accordingly. “The overwhelming negative factor is the surge in energy prices, driving inflation to record highs and putting a strain on European businesses and households. While growth will continue this year and next, it will be much more subdued than previously expected. Uncertainty and risks to the outlook will remain high as long as Russia’s aggression continues.” News of the gloomier outlook for the EU came in after signs of a rapid slowing in the world’s second biggest economy, China. Analysts had pencilled in an annual decline in retail sales of 6% in April as a result of lockdowns and falling consumer confidence but official figures showed the fall was almost twice as big at just over 11%. The closure of factories meant industrial production fell by 2.9% year on year in April – the biggest fall since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate – a closely watched indicator by the Chinese authorities – rose from 5.8% to 6.1%. Iris Pang, an analyst at ING, said she expected China’s gross domestic product – a measure of its growth rate – to be 1% lower in the second quarter of 2022 than a year earlier. “The main reason is the long lockdown in Shanghai,” Pang said. “This hurt retail sales the most, and also those factories that do not have ‘closed-loop operation’; if they don’t have dormitories for workers, they struggle to operate.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"YouTube removes more than 9,000 channels relating to Ukraine war",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/22/youtube-ukraine-invasion-russia-video-removals,2022-05-22T10:07:48Z,Exclusive: Platform takes ‘unprecedented action’ to address content guideline violations since invasion,"YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”. The platform is hugely popular in Russia, where, unlike some of its US peers, it has not been shut down despite hosting content from opposition figures such as Alexei Navalny. YouTube has also been able to operate in Russia despite cracking down on pro-Kremlin content that has broken guidelines including its major violent events policy, which prohibits denying or trivialising the invasion. Since the conflict began in February, YouTube has taken down channels including that of the pro-Kremlin journalist Vladimir Solovyov. Channels associated with Russia’s Ministries of Defence and Foreign Affairs have also been temporarily suspended from uploading videos in recent months for describing the war as a “liberation mission”. YouTube’s chief product officer, Neal Mohan, said: “We have a major violent events policy and that applies to things like denial of major violent events: everything from the Holocaust to Sandy Hook. And of course, what’s happening in Ukraine is a major violent event. And so we’ve used that policy to take unprecedented action.” In an interview with the Guardian, Mohan added that YouTube’s news content on the conflict had received more than 40m views in Ukraine alone. “The first and probably most paramount responsibility is making sure that people who are looking for information about this event can get accurate, high-quality, credible information on YouTube,” he said. “The consumption of authoritative channels on our platform has grown significantly, of course in Ukraine, but also in countries surrounding Ukraine, Poland, and also within Russia itself.” YouTube did not provide a breakdown of the taken-down content and channels but Mohan said much of it represented Kremlin narratives about the invasion. “I don’t have the specific numbers, but you can imagine a lot of it being the narratives that are coming from Russian government, or Russian actors on behalf of the Russian government,” he said. YouTube has an estimated 90 million users in Russia, although it no longer allows advertising on the platform in the country. The decision by YouTube’s parent company, Google, has drawn protests from Navalny, who said well-targeted ads helped counteract Kremlin propaganda. “YouTube remains the largest video-sharing site up and running in Russia itself,” said Mohan. “So YouTube is a place where Russian citizens can get uncensored information about the war, including from many of the same authoritative channels that we all have access to outside of the country. We remain an important platform for Russian citizens themselves as this crisis continues to evolve.” Last week, the Russian minister for digital development, Maksut Shadaev, said the country would not block YouTube, despite disputes over content that have resulted in the platform being fined in court for not removing banned videos. Shadaev indicated that blocking Russia’s most popular social media platform would affect users. “We are not planning to close YouTube,” the minister said. “Above all, when we restrict something, we should clearly understand that our users won’t suffer.” YouTube has also placed a worldwide ban on channels associated with Russian state media, including Russia Today and Sputnik. Facebook and Instagram are banned in Russia and access to Twitter has been restricted, in response to the platforms’ own bans on Russian state-owned media.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Putin ties Ukraine invasion to second world war | First Thing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/09/first-thing-putin-ties-ukraine-invasion-to-second-world-war,2022-05-09T10:11:57Z,"Soldiers ‘fighting for same thing their fathers and grandfathers did’, says president in Victory Day speech. Plus, why film posters for comedies have huge red letters","Good morning. Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did” as he used his Victory Day speech to tie the war in Ukraine to the memory of the second world war and justify his invasion. Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was “forced” into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a “special operation”. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia’s “greatest generation” to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. What did the G7’s statement marking the anniversary say? Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies said. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 75 of the invasion. Capitol attack panel moves closer to issuing subpoenas to Republicans Members on the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack on 6 January are moving closer to issuing subpoenas to Republican members of Congress to compel their cooperation in the inquiry – though it has started to dawn on them that they may be out of time. The panel is expected to make a final decision on the subpoena question over the next couple of weeks, according to sources directly familiar with internal deliberations, with House investigators needing to start wrapping up their work before public hearings in June. While the members on the committee remain undecided about whether to subpoena Republican members of Congress, their refusal to assist the investigation has caused the sentiment to turn towards taking that near-unprecedented action, the sources said. The shifting view has come as a result of the dismay among the members in January, when the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and others turned down requests for voluntary cooperation, turning to anger after three more of Donald Trump’s allies last week refused to cooperate. What has changed in recent weeks? Sources said the select committee’s assessment can no longer ignore the deep involvement between some Republican members of Congress and the former president’s unlawful schemes to overturn the election. Canada and Mexico prepare to accept Americans seeking abortions In the years before Canada’s supreme court legalised abortion in 1988, it was common for Canadians who needed abortions to travel to the US. “We had a network of people who could make referrals and help them get there [to the US]. If it’s necessary, that probably would happen again – but the other way,” said Carolyn Egan, spokesperson for the Abortion Rights Coalition of Canada. If, as a leaked draft decision indicates, the US supreme court votes to overturn Roe v Wade, many Americans in need of surgical abortion could be forced to travel not just across state lines but, once again, across international borders, writes Hilary Beaumont. On Tuesday, Canada’s minister of families, Karina Gould, reaffirmed that Americans can access abortion services in Canada. “If they, people, come here and need access, certainly, you know, that’s a service that would be provided,” she told CBC News. South of the US border, Mexican advocates are also preparing for an increase in Americans visiting to access abortion services. How are GOP lawmakers prepping to ban abortion as soon as legally possible? Here is what Republican state lawmakers across the country are doing in the lead up to the decision to assure that abortion restrictions will swiftly go into effect. What about the Democrats? Senator Kirsten Gillibrand called the battle over abortion rights in the US the “biggest fight of a generation”. The New York Democrat urged her party to stand up to Republicans seeking to abolish the constitutional right. In other news … The US first lady, Jill Biden, made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine on Sunday, holding a surprise Mother’s Day meeting with the nation’s first lady, Olena Zelenska. She traveled under a cloak of secrecy, becoming the latest high-profile American to enter Ukraine during the 10-week-old conflict. Polls have opened in the Philippines as the country decides its next president in a polarising race between frontrunner Ferdinand Marcos Jr, the son of the late dictator, and a human rights lawyer who has vowed to tackle old, rotten politics. Opinion surveys suggest Marcos Jr, known as Bongbong, is poised to win. The torsos of two statues of boxers, dating back to the iron age, have been discovered at the Mont’e Prama necropolis in Sardinia. The latest finds, sculpted in limestone by the Nuragic civilisation, add to several other statues of boxers, wrestlers and archers dug up at the site since the 1970s. The New York Times has removed the word “fetus” from its Wordle answers to keep the game “distinct from the news”, a move apparently related to last week’s leaked Roe v Wade supreme court draft ruling. The change caused confusion as it was only implemented for some of the game’s players. Stat of the day: ‘Forever chemicals’ may have polluted 20m acres of US cropland, study says About 20m acres of cropland in the United States may be contaminated from PFAS-tainted sewage sludge that has been used as fertilizer, a new report estimates. PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, are a class of about 9,000 compounds used to make products heat-, water- or stain-resistant. Known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t naturally break down, they have been linked to cancer, thyroid disruption, liver problems, birth defects, immunosuppression and more.

Climate check: The growing scandal of fish waste Dumped at sea, lost on land or left to rot in shops and fridges, the global catch of fish is being wasted like never before – hurting not only the oceans but the nutrition of billions of people. Figures from WWF show that in 2019, at least 230,000 tonnes of fish were dumped in EU waters. But this figure is a fraction of an even larger global issue. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates 35% of all fish, crustaceans and molluscs harvested from oceans, lakes and fish farms are wasted or lost before they ever reach a plate. Last Thing: Painting swapped in 70s for grilled cheese sandwich serves up windfall Running a small restaurant in Ontario in the 1970s, Irene and Tony Demas soon learned the value of trading their dishes for the talents of local bakers, craftspeople and artisans. For an English painter with a predictable palate, the couple struck a deal: they would get paintings from him and his friends in exchange for grilled cheese sandwiches. By chance, that deal unwittingly netted them a painting by the acclaimed Canadian folk artist Maud Lewis – a work that nearly five decades later is expected to net more than C$35,000 (US$27,000) when it goes to auction this month.

100 days of war in Ukraine: how the conflict has developed,https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2022/jun/01/100-days-of-war-in-ukraine-how-the-conflict-has-developed,2022-06-01T09:02:09Z,Friday marks the 100th day of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. This is how the Russian president’s ‘special military operation’ evolved into a bloody war of attrition,"WARNING: this piece contains distressing and violent imagery After months of buildup and numerous denials that any invasion was planned, Vladimir Putin announced on 24 February that he had launched a “special military operation” to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine. Western analysts expected a quick “shock and awe” invasion, and it seems there were indeed attempts by Russia to directly target the Ukrainian president, Volodomyr Zelenskiy, probably in order to replace his government with one more pliable to Moscow’s will. But if Putin expected a quick, easy war with little Ukrainian or international opposition – like his invasion of Crimea in 2014 – he has been disappointed. The war has resulted in sanctions against Russia, Nato membership applications from Sweden and Finland, and rising fuel and food prices in countries thousands of miles from the conflict zone. This is how it has developed in Ukraine.

German thinkers’ war of words over Ukraine exposes generational divide,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/german-thinkers-war-of-words-over-ukraine-exposes-generational-divide,2022-05-06T04:00:04Z,Group in favour of supplying Kyiv with weapons noticeably younger than those of opposing view,"The war in Ukraine is laying bare a generational divide over what lessons Germany should draw from its own history of waging bloody conflicts, as some of the country’s leading artists and intellectuals line up in favour of or against supplying Kyiv with weapons in a series of open letters. The first, published in the feminist magazine Emma on Friday last week, days after the German government announced it would send about 50 Gepard self-propelled anti-aircraft guns to Ukraine, urged the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to refrain from directly or indirectly contributing further heavy weapons systems to the conflict. Signed by 26 prominent artists and intellectuals including Emma’s feminist publisher, Alice Schwarzer, the novelists Martin Walser, Juli Zeh and Robert Seethaler, the film-makers Andreas Dresen, Alexander Kluge and Helke Sander and the actor Lars Eidinger, the letter condemned Russia’s war of aggression as a “breach of the basic norms of international law”. Nonetheless, the letter argued it was a mistake to assume that the responsibility for Vladimir Putin’s war potentially escalating into a nuclear conflict “would lie purely with the original aggressor and not also those who with open eyes offered him a motive for potentially criminal acts”. The signees urged Scholz to heed Germany’s “historic responsibility” by helping the two sides find a “compromise that both can accept”. The letter drew some angry responses, including from the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, accused Schwarzer and her co-signees of “vulgar pacifism”. “What is the conclusion of such an argument?” the Green politician asked. “It’s basically that a little bit of occupation, rape and execution should be acceptable and that Ukraine should capitulate swiftly. I don’t think that’s right.” Another open letter, published on Wednesday in the weekly broadsheet Die Zeit, expanded this counter-argument, urging Scholz to continue supporting Ukraine’s defence with military hardware. Initiated by the former Green politician Ralf Fücks and signed by 58 artists and intellectuals including the Nobel literature prize recipient Herta Müller, the pianist Igor Levit and the German PEN’s president, Deniz Yücel, the letter said preventing a Russian victory in Ukraine “lies in Germany’s interest”. “Those who want a negotiated peace that doesn’t result in Ukraine’s submission to Russian demands must increase [Ukraine’s] defensive capabilities and weaken Russia’s belligerency as much as possible,” it said. The Booker-nominated German novelist Daniel Kehlmann, who was another of the Zeit letter’s signees, told the Guardian he had been motivated to put his name to the appeal after seeing the “deep shock and horror” among his eastern European friends at reading the Emma letter. “It seemed to urge Ukraine to capitulate as quickly as possible to end the war,” Kehlmann said. “That may have been an understandable view on the first or second day of the invasion. Now the reality is different: there is a chance that Ukraine can win this war, and we have to support its defensive effort in any way we can, both for moral and tactical reasons.” Kehlmann said he felt some sympathy with German hesitancy at embracing martial rhetoric in light of its own violently aggressive past. “When Scholz announced that he would increase military spending, I too instinctively felt strange at the thought of supporting German armament,” he said. In a long essay published in Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper on the same day as the Emma letter, the sociologist and philosopher Jürgen Habermas had framed the German debate over arms exports as a generational divide over applying “aggressively self-confident” and “shrill” language to a military conflict. A younger generation, personified to Habermas by Germany’s 41-year-old foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, had been “raised to exhibit sensitivity on normative questions” and only managed to “view war through the lens of victory or defeat”, he said. His own generation, the 92-year-old philosopher seemed to suggest, “know that a war against a nuclear power cannot be ‘won’ in the traditional sense of the word”. He said the “broad pro-dialogue, peacekeeping focus of German policy” was a “hard-won mentality” given its track record as an aggressively militaristic state, and which had been historically denounced from the right. But the ability of some Germans to look at the Ukraine war solely through the lens of their experience in the second world war has also drawn criticism. In a radio interview, Kluge, 90, announced that he had been happy to see US troops march into his home town in 1945 and that there was therefore “nothing evil about capitulation if it ends the war”. The interview was met with widespread disbelief for muddling up the historic lessons of an aggressor nation and those of states that had come under German attack. With an average age of 54, the signatories of the letter in Die Zeit are noticeably younger and have more multicultural backgrounds than those of the preceding letter in Emma, who average 76. “One of the lessons of German history has to be that you cannot defeat fascism with appeasement,” Kehlmann said. The novelist, whose grandparents were Jewish, added: “It is noticeable that the argument for a strictly pacifist foreign policy is rarely brought forward by Germans whose relatives died in the Holocaust.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine war is Putin’s death warrant, says wife of jailed politician ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/putin-vladimir-kara-murza-wife-russian-politician,2022-05-29T10:22:37Z,Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia says Russian president will fall over war in Ukraine,"Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife Evgenia thinks he will have been like a “hurricane contained inside a bottle” since he was arrested on 11 April in Moscow and held in pre-trial detention over a speech he had made in Arizona criticising the war in Ukraine. “He has so much energy, so many ideas, and initiatives, that being contained within the four walls of a prison will be the hardest part for him,” said Evgenia, who has not been allowed to speak to him. As a Russian politician, campaigner and regime critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza worked for 15 years alongside Boris Nemtsov, another opposition leader, who was killed in 2015. Sitting in a hotel near Westminster on the same day she met the Foreign Office minister James Cleverly, Evgenia Kara-Murza warned the UK government that her husband, a British citizen who has twice been allegedly poisoned by the Russian spy agency the FSB, may have reason to fear for his own life. She had no criticism of her husband’s decision to repeatedly return to Russia, even after the invasion of Ukraine, saying: “He believed that as a Russian politician, he cannot call on people to continue fighting if he himself is somewhere safe, and he believes that he has to share the same risks, the same challenges as the Russians who continue to oppose this war. “Basically, by calling this war a war, instead of the ‘special operation’ as the government wants it to be called, by saying that, a person can end up in prison for up to 15 years. On the basis of the charges laid so far Vladimir is now facing up to 10 years.” No court date has been yet set, possibly because officials will press additional charges such as advocating personal sanctions against the regime, she said. “Our family has been living like this for a long time,” said Kara-Murza, who has three teenage children. “He was targeted by an FSB team that tried to kill him twice in 2015 and 2017. “Thanks to an amazing independent investigation by Bellingcat and Insider, we now know the names and the faces of those people from the FSB, who had followed him before the poisoning. Both times Vladimir was left in a coma with multiple organ failure. And I brought him back to the US. He recovered and then he went back to Russia. “The Russian authorities have chosen this new tactic of dealing with opposition figures, especially well-known opposition figures like [Alexei] Navalny, or my husband – they try to lock them away and hide them from the public eye and prevent them from continuing to work. It is because they’re so effective when they’re outside.” Kara-Murza said that since the war started Russia had switched from being an authoritarian regime to a totalitarian one. “There is not one independent media outlet left, there is massive repression and propaganda pumped out on national TV … There is a new iron curtain around this country.” But she insisted dissent exists below the surface as people access news via virtual private networks or the Telegram messaging service. “I believe that Putin has not yet declared mobilisation because he knows how people will react to it. But a week or two ago, they said that there have already been 11 conscription centres burned down across Russia. “So that’s how people protest – by saying: ‘We’re not going to go to your war.’ People get arrested for going out on the street with a copy of War and Peace. Others have been arrested for carrying ‘invisible anti-government slogans’. The police said they could see invisible things. It is that crazy.” She pleaded for the west not to give up on the dissidents in Russia. “I believe Putin has signed his own death warrant with this war,” she said, “but he will fall the sooner we end these double standards: at the same time as countries support the Ukrainian people by sending weapons and providing humanitarian aid and imposing sanctions on the Russian economy, they also give Putin billions for oil and gas, which allows him to continue his aggression … this has to stop because honestly, it is inexplicable.” Her husband’s arrest and her campaign to secure his release have required her to change her role. “The fact is, I’ve never been a public figure. I’ve never been a public speaker, so everything I’m doing today, I’m learning it day by day. “All the people I’m meeting, I heard of them, of course, from my husband’s work, but I’ve met very few of them before. So everything is novel. Everything – speaking and being on stage, speaking to journalists – is very new to me. It’s a rather glum joke, but we do have this joke in the family, that I only emerge when my husband gets poisoned or thrown in jail.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘This is Europe’s war’: the foreign volunteer medics on Ukraine frontline,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/ukraine-war-foreign-medics-volunteer-frontline,2022-05-29T10:11:57Z,People who feel compelled to help are ferrying casualties from intense fighting in the east to hospitals,"It was the photo of a young girl, dying in a Mariupol hospital after Russian shelling, that made up Martin Wyness’ mind. He had to go and help in Ukraine. Less than three months later, he was in an ambulance racing to save the life of another little girl gravely injured by a Russian attack, as more shells crashed down around them. They turned around and raced back the way they had came, looking for another route to safety and medical care for the eight-year-old, whose body was peppered with shrapnel. “They didn’t get her the first time so they had another go,” he said, in his hospital base in Donbas region. “As if that little girl wasn’t vulnerable enough.” Wyness is part of a volunteer medical unit bridging the gap between Ukraine’s eastern frontline – which is experiencing the most intense fighting of the war – and major hospitals where war-injured soldiers and civilians can get long-term treatment for their wounds. Medbat Pirogov volunteer hospital brings together dozens of Ukrainians, including some who returned from abroad to serve, and a handful of internationals who felt compelled to try to help out in a conflict thousands of miles from home. “I felt this wasn’t Ukraine’s war, it was Europe’s war, my war,” said Wyness. He has twice made the journey to Ukraine from his Southampton home. The first month of the war he spent in the basement of a Kyiv hospital, patching up those injured in the battle for the city. After the Russians were defeated he returned home for a break, but in early May returned to the new frontline near the almost-besieged town of Sievierodonetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the battle in Donbas was so intense that up to 100 of the country’s soldiers were dying in combat each day. It is a gruelling artillery duel in which the enemy is often faceless and unseen, appearing only in the form of shells, rockets and missiles, and visible through the terrible injuries they inflict on the bodies of civilians and soldiers alike. “Some days I think I’ve got to go, it’s just too much,” Wyness said, in an interview interrupted when shells started landing close to the base and the team had to race down to a basement bunker. Both the injuries and the constant threat of death are exhausting; the medics are targets for a military that has repeatedly bombed hospitals in Ukraine and in Syria, killing doctors, nurses and patients in defiance of international law. The medics are fundraising for armoured ambulances that would at least protect medics and patients from the worst of the shrapnel, but the war has sent prices even for secondhand vehicles soaring. So for now the group race towards the frontline in ordinary vehicles that would be ripped to shreds if an artillery round landed too close. Jennifer spent $4,500 (£3,560) of her own money to travel from California and risk death daily to help out. She does not want her last name published because she told her mum she was only going to Poland to help refugees, although she told her daughters – who are 17 and 23 – the truth. “The way I’ve raised them, they understand that this is an important thing to do,” she said. “If you know something is wrong and you don’t say or do anything, it’s doubly wrong.” Jennifer worked as a medic in Afghanistan, on contract with the international mission, so is used to conflict injuries and dangerous environments but the intensity and proximity of the fighting in Ukraine has still shocked her. “It’s more than I expected. Yesterday morning I was upstairs getting changed, a rocket flew by and landed just close by. The first night we got here we were in the basement, told to get ready to evacuate, because they thought the Russians had breached [Ukrainian lines] and were coming.” She made up her mind to volunteer when she saw Zelenskiy appealing to the world for assistance in Ukraine’s struggle, and began researching her options before contacting Gennadiy Druzenko, the founder of Medbat. “It’s a struggle for freedom and they need help,” Jennifer said. Ukrainians have tried to deter foreigners who do not have military experience from trying to go to the frontlines but Martin and Jennifer have practical skills that are needed as the deaths and injuries mount among civilians and soldiers. There are also Ukrainian medics in the team, some returned from abroad, others unable to get commissions in the oversubscribed military medical corps but determined to serve. Dmytro Rusnak drove back from Germany with a car full of medical aid. He had been getting ready for this moment for the best part of a decade. In 2014, after Russia seized Crimea and Russian-backed proxy forces took control of parts of Donbas, Rusnak changed his speciality from radiology to acute care. “I saw I had to prepare myself, because at any moment it was possible that Russia could start a full war,” he said. When they did, he paused only to put his contract on hold – his bosses were very understanding – and gather as much medical supplies as he could from friends and colleagues. His main worry when the shells start falling is not his own safety but the worry he is bringing his elderly parents. “Although they are proud, it is very traumatic for them, there are no parents who want to see their children’s funeral.” He is waiting to get his German medical qualifications certified so he can practise as a doctor in Ukraine, so for now works with Wyness as an ambulance paramedic. “These years of education and preparation, all these skills, should be used,” he said. “I wanted to be an example, you can say thousands of words, make thousands of posts on social media, but this means nothing … you have to act, to do something.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian soldier says he will accept punishment for Ukraine war crime,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russian-soldier-will-accept-punishment-ukraine-war-crime-vadim-shysimarin,2022-05-20T13:26:23Z,"Tank commander Vadim Shysimarin, 21, tells court he was ‘nervous’ and ‘didn’t want to kill’ unarmed civilian","A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”. Standing in the glass defence box, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, his shaved head lowered, Shysimarin added: “I’m truly and sincerely sorry. I didn’t want that to happen, I didn’t want to be there, but it happened. I would like to apologise once again. And I will accept all the measures of punishment that I will be offered.” On Thursday, during the second hearing, Shysimarin asked Shelipov’s widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband. Prosecutors have asked the judge to sentence Shysimarin to life in prison. In closing arguments, Shysimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, said his client was not guilty of premeditated murder and war crimes, and asked the judges to acquit him. In an interview with the Guardian at the end of the hearing, Ovsyannikov said his client killed a civilian by order and therefore he did not consider it to be a breach of the rules of war. “There is an absence of intent here,” he said. “It was an execution of an order … he didn’t want to kill him, and this has certain legal meaning. “I would single out those bastards that shot at the back of civilians’ heads in Bucha during the occupation,” Ovsyannikov added. “It’s quite different from the circumstances my client was in.” According to the Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk, the instruction to open fire cannot be considered a military order and therefore does not protect Shysimarin from responsibility. “The person who gave an ‘order’ wasn’t his commander. He was aware of that. The person who gave the instruction was aware of that. Before they got into the vehicle they didn’t know each other,” Syniuk said. Shysimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia and was a commander in the Kantemirovskaya tank division on the day of the killing. Earlier in the day he had been with a group of Russian soldiers who shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces. The Russian soldiers then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone a few dozen metres from his own home. One of the men in the car told Shysimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Shysimarin opened fire out of the car window. “He fired three to four shots from his automatic weapons,” Syniuk told the court. “Could he have stepped out of the car and expropriated the phone of the victim. Yes he could. Could he just make one shot? Yes he could. But instead, he killed a civilian citizen of Ukraine.” More than 1,000 bodies of civilians were found under the rubble or in mass graves when the Russians withdrew from the Kyiv region in early April, leaving in their path a huge crime scene that international and Ukrainian prosecutors have been working on. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases for war crimes trials, and authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes, including attacks on hospitals. Ukraine’s Interfax news agency reported on Thursday that two more Russian soldiers on trial in the centre of the country had admitted to accusations of firing artillery on civilians. Authorities in Ukraine are moving fast and trying to carry out justice while the conflict is ongoing. Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor in the Kyiv region, said they had identified more than 5,000 Russian soldiers who operated north of Kyiv. “It’s an ongoing process,” he said. “After they have been identified we are trying to understand which crimes they committed. We are keeping records of all prisoners of war, and we know which ones did and which ones didn’t commit war crimes. The prosecutor general’s office is in charge of that, as well as of the exchange of prisoners. So only the prisoners who didn’t commit any war crimes could be exchanged.” Asked if Shysimarin could be exchanged with Ukrainian prisoners, his lawyer replied: “Theoretically an exchange is possible. But it’s a separate process. Any prisoner of war could be exchanged.” The Kremlin has said it has no information about the trial and that the absence of a diplomatic mission in Ukraine limits its ability to provide legal assistance, but has denied its soldiers committed war crimes. The trial is being seen as a public test of the independence of Ukraine’s judicial system. A verdict is expected on Monday.

"Energy prices and Ukraine war no excuse for climate inaction, say experts",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jun/06/energy-prices-ukraine-war-climate-summit-bonn,2022-06-06T11:37:08Z,World risks ‘sleepwalking to disaster’ officials told as climate summit kicks off in Bonn,"Governments cannot use geopolitical tensions and soaring energy prices as an excuse for falling behind on their climate commitments, experts and diplomats warned as officials from around the world gathered for talks on the climate crisis in Bonn on Monday. These are the first UN climate negotiations since Russia invaded Ukraine, and the first since the Cop26 summit in Glasgow in November ended with countries pledging to reconvene this year with strengthened commitments on cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Patricia Espinosa, the UN’s climate chief, warned: “Climate change is not an agenda we can afford to push back on our global schedule. We need decisions and actions now, and it is incumbent on all nations to make progress in Bonn.” With less than six months to go before Cop27 in Egypt this November, few countries are yet planning to update their plans on emissions cuts – known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs) – in line with the goal of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, as they agreed to do in Glasgow. Artur Runge-Metzger, a former EU chief negotiator, now a fellow of the Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change in Berlin, told the Guardian: “Countries will use Bonn to show where they stand, what their priorities are ahead of Cop27, and they must address the ambition gap [between the pledges made at Cop26 and those needed to hold to 1.5C]. “Everyone knows that coming out of Glasgow, the 1.5C goal was not 100% accomplished – it was a big step forward, but there is still a gap remaining.” If fulfilled, the pledges on emissions cuts would result in a temperature rise of less than 2C, the first time this milestone has been reached. However, that is still a long way adrift of the 1.5C threshold countries have agreed to target. Analysts said tougher pledges were urgently needed. Bill Hare, the chief executive of Climate Analytics, warned: “The world appears to be sleepwalking to disaster. Governments appear to think taking more action is too hard. What will be more difficult is dealing with a 3C world. Already this year, we’ve seen horrific impacts, like the heatwave in India and Pakistan, and floods in the same region. This is just the beginning.” Many countries have scope to take more action, particularly as soaring energy prices have forced them to reconsider their energy security. Niklas Höhne, of the NewClimate Institute, said: “The EU could take the lead as it is already set to overachieve its renewables targets. It would be good to see at least one big emitter step up and … bring others along.” On current policies and measures, the world would reach at least 2.7C and potentially 3.6C. The three living former UN climate chiefs made a rare joint statement in the Guardian last week, pointing out this “implementation gap” and criticising countries for failing to translate their promises into policy. Espinosa also called for action in Bonn. “Cop27 in Egypt needs to focus on implementation. Nations must show how they will, through legislation, policies and programmes, and throughout all jurisdictions and sectors, begin putting the [2015] Paris agreement to work in their home countries,” she said. The fortnight-long Bonn talks are unlikely to produce any breakthrough or firm resolutions but are an opportunity for countries to iron out details left over at Glasgow and set out plans on their key priorities for Cop27 in Sharm el-Sheikh. Observers will be watching keenly to judge the atmosphere at the talks, and whether countries are willing to cooperate, despite the worsening geopolitical tensions around the Ukraine war, economic and social instability as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and high energy and food prices. At Glasgow, negotiators finally put the seal on the Paris rulebook, the set of instructions and accords needed to put the 2015 agreement into operation. Those complex technical issues, which also involved difficult political conundrums such as whether to allow countries to use carbon trading to meet their emissions goals, have occupied thousands of hours of negotiating time. Now, countries should, in theory at least, have cleared much more space at Bonn and in Egypt for negotiators to grapple with the substantive issues, such as emissions cuts. However, thorny problems remain, including the protection of the world’s forests, the means of providing finance for poor countries to adapt to the impacts of climate breakdown, and the vexed question of loss and damage, which refers to the types of catastrophic damage that cannot be adapted to, and for which poor countries will need particular help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Speaking alongside Slovakia’s president, Zuzana Čaputová, in Kyiv, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, noted that 50 days have passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages. Ukraine is working on an international United Nations-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia is playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Ukraine’s giant seed bank near battlefields is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing from Russian forces. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risks “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continue. Ukraine is to prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. It was announced on Tuesday as representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes and international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, met at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. In an interview late on Monday, Oleg Morozov, first elected to the Russian parliament in 1993 and a member of the dominant United Russia party, said on Rossiya-1 state TV he has a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister will travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president Dmitry Medvedev has claimed. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security matters, said in a post on Telegram on Tuesday that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have incurred losses for big business. Ukraine is still in control of some parts of Sievierodonetsk city. Its soldiers are fighting slowly advancing Russian troops, but civilian evacuations are not currently possible, the head of the city’s administration has said. Russians now control “around half”, according to reports on national television in Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia’s war in Ukraine: complete guide in maps, video and pictures",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/mar/17/russias-war-in-ukraine-complete-guide-in-maps-video-and-pictures,2022-05-15T18:17:43Z,Where is fighting happening and how did we get here?,"What is happening? Hundreds of Ukrainian fighters, including wounded men carried out on stretchers, left the vast steel plant in Mariupol where they had mounted a dogged last stand and turned themselves over to Russian hands. More than 260 fighters left the Azovstal plant — their last redoubt in the southern port city — on Monday and were transported to two towns controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, officials on both sides said. Other fighters — their precise numbers unknown — remain inside the ruins of the fortified mill that sprawls over 4 square mile in the otherwise now Russian-held city. Azovstal’s fall marks the complete capture of Mariupol, a significant milestone in one of the bloodiest battles of the war. Footage published over the weekend showed the steelworks being bombarded. Wrapping up Mariupol’s capture would give Russia an unbroken land bridge to the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed from Ukraine in 2014, and also deprives Ukraine of a vital port. It could also free up Russian forces for fighting elsewhere in the industrial heartland of eastern Ukraine. Severodonetsk Fighting is increasingly focusing on the Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war, and an a effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. A smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. What happened in first three weeks of the invasion? How did we get here? In the months before its invasion, Russia deployed hundreds of tanks, self-propelled artillery and short-range ballistic missiles from as far away as Siberia to within striking range of Ukraine. Moscow’s rhetoric grew more belligerent. Putin demanded legal guarantees that Ukraine would never join Nato or host its missile strike systems, concessions he was unlikely to receive. A flurry of diplomatic activity did little to ease tensions. The second half of February was long considered the most likely period for a potential offensive. Russian soldiers stayed on in Belarus beyond the end of planned military exercises, and the Winter Olympics, hosted by Russia’s ally China, concluded. The invasion was preceded on 22 February by Putin saying Russia would recognise the territorial claims of self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. He had already ordered his forces into Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. What do we know about Russia’s deployments? Scores of battalion tactical groups – the smallest operational unit in Russia’s army, consisting of about 800-1,000 troops – were put in place near the borders of Ukraine in Russia and Belarus before the invasion. As of 18 February, the US estimated that Russia had 169,000-190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine. An estimated 32,000 separatist forces were already operating in the breakaway areas in Donetsk and Luhansk – some of whom were likely to be unacknowledged Russian forces – before the invasion. Many of the heavy weapons stationed near Ukraine arrived as far back as spring 2021. Over the new year Russia also began to move tanks, artillery, air-defence systems and fighter jets to Belarus for joint exercises in February. That deployment then grew. These satellite image composites show the buildup of troops in Yelnya and Pogonovo over the new year. Satellite photographs also showed increased deployments in Novoozernoye, in western Crimea. The US estimates that 10,000 troops moved into Crimea in late January and early February. Satellite images taken on 20 February showed troops and equipment being moved from holding areas to potential launch locations. How do the militaries compare? Russia’s invasion pits the Kremlin’s large, recently modernised military against an adversary largely using older versions of the same or similar equipment, dating back to the Soviet era. Russia has significant numerical advantages on land, and in particular in the air and at sea, although Ukrainians are defending their homeland. What is the historical context? In 2014 Putin sent troops to annex Crimea, a mainly Russian-speaking region of Ukraine. Russia also incited a separatist uprising in Ukraine’s south-east, clandestinely sending soldiers and weapons to provoke a conflict that grew into a full-blown war. A 2015 peace deal established a line of demarcation and called on both sides to make concessions. After that, low-level fighting continued along the front, and each side accused the other of violating the agreement. Going back further, Russia has long opposed any attempts by Ukraine to move towards the EU and Nato. One of Putin’s oft-repeated demands was a guarantee that Ukraine would never join Nato, the alliance of 30 countries that has expanded eastwards since the end of the cold war. What was the role of Nord Stream 2? On 22 February, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, stopped the certification process for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in response to Russia’s recognition of the two self-proclaimed republics. First announced in 2015, the $11bn (£8.3bn) pipeline owned by Russia’s state-backed energy firm Gazprom was built to carry gas from western Siberia to Lubmin in Germany’s north-east, doubling the existing capacity of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline and keeping 26m German homes warm at an affordable price. Nord Stream 2, Europe’s most divisive energy project, bypassed the traditional gas transit nation of Ukraine by running along the bed of the Baltic Sea. It faced resistance within the EU, and from the US as well as Ukraine, on the grounds that it increased Europe’s energy dependence on Russia, denied Ukraine transit fees, and made it more vulnerable to Russian invasion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
John Kerry warns a long Ukraine war would threaten climate efforts,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/john-kerry-warns-long-ukraine-war-threaten-climate-efforts,2022-05-10T18:08:53Z,Exclusive: US presidential envoy says limiting global heating to 1.5C could be made harder by conflict,"The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned. Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. “If it’s a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,” Kerry said. “It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].” But he added: “The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes [to stay within 1.5C]. There are a number of scientists who believe we are on the edge of 1.5C now. Anything that is not part of the acceleration [of emissions-cutting efforts] gets in the way.” He said the agreement reached at the UN Cop26 climate summit last year would have “faced some big hurdles” if taking place in the current geopolitical circumstances, but there was still a chance of fulfilling its promises. “This is not easy, but it hasn’t fallen apart,” he told the Guardian. “[The effort to stay within 1.5C] has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done, and it’s going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.” The world’s leading climate scientists recently warned it was “now or never” for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Kerry said this showed there was still a chance of holding to the 1.5C goal. “The IPCC said to us a few weeks ago ‘we’re behind, it’s not getting better at the pace it should be, emissions have gone up, but you still have time to do this’,” he said. “And my message to people is we have to take advantage of the fact that the science tells us we still have time, but we have to greatly accelerate what we’re doing. We have to speed up very significantly.” He said the disruption caused by the Ukraine war was forcing countries to reconsider their dependence on fossil fuels. “The promises of Cop26 were never going to be fulfilled in six months, or one year or two years. These are promises for 2030. A hiccup of a number of months may be something that we can work around or get through.” Kerry also said the US would increase its production of natural gas, despite its climate targets, to help allies replace Russian fossil fuels. He said gas from the US produced lower carbon emissions than gas from Russia, owing to more efficient extraction, and could provide a short-term solution while countries ramp up renewable energy. The US president, Joe Biden, has come under heavy criticism from green campaigners in the US for allowing the expansion of gas drilling, opening up new tracts of public land for exploration and development. Kerry said more gas was needed in the short term, to make up for supplies lost from Russia, but that companies should beware of building large amounts of new gas infrastructure that would be left as stranded assets when the energy crisis passes. “Gas has always been part of the transition away from dirtier fossil fuels and towards this new energy economy,” he said. “I’d take a gas-fired power plant in the near term – I emphasise near term – over coal or oil any day of the week. But we don’t want to build out a huge new infrastructure around gas that has stranded asset challenges or is unabated [not fitted with technology to capture and store carbon] after a number of years.” He hinted at moves to limit how long such plants could operate. “We have to decide how quickly we must have a requisite for abatement – maybe 10 years, eight years, who knows? But for the long run, gas is going to have to abate and live up to low emissions standards just like everybody else,” he said. With six months to go before the next UN climate summit, Cop27 in Egypt, Kerry said the focus must be on the G20 countries, the world’s 20 biggest economies, which are responsible for about 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions-cutting plans these countries brought to Cop26 were inadequate to meet the 1.5C target, so they have been asked to come to Egypt this November with more stringent proposals. Kerry acknowledged that many countries were unlikely to meet the targets, including Russia, which is one of the biggest fossil fuel producers. He warned some countries were “indifferent” to the need to cut emissions, or have vested interests in not doing so. “The war is not the only thing that’s in the way of the acceleration – an unfortunate indifference in some quarters, outright disinformation in others, and people who just love the status quo is perhaps one of our biggest problems,” he said. But there were hopes that major emitters including China and India were embracing change, he added. “We’re prepared to try to help China or provide whatever China is willing to accept in terms of assistance.” He also pointed to India, currently suffering a massive heatwave, where a large expansion of renewable energy is planned that could enable the country to cut emissions in line with a global 1.5C temperature goal. Kerry said he was hopeful that the climate legislation currently stuck in Congress, largely because of the refusal of a single Democratic senator to pass it, would soon be resolved. He said other countries were unlikely to be discouraged from taking action themselves by the US’s own internal difficulties. “Maybe they’ll say ‘screw them, they can’t get their act together, we’re going to do it’,” he said. “I can’t predict, but I can tell you this: that President Biden is committed to moving forward and obviously he has administrative powers and can issue certain executive orders and do certain things. “Even while Donald Trump was president, pulled out of Paris, 75% of the new power that came online in the US was renewable. So the truth is that a lot of what happens in the US will be governed locally and some nationally by governors of states and mayors of cities who are deeply committed.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 96 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-96-of-the-invasion,2022-05-30T18:07:20Z,French journalist is killed near Sievierodonetsk; EU leaders fail to agree on a Russian oil import ban,"A French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, was killed after an evacuation car was hit near the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.” EU leaders failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided. Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures. Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles. The scheme would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt. In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”. The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February. The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv. Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.” “Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech last night about the status of Sievierodonetsk. The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1. Lavrov also denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine war may be causing rise in dolphin deaths, say scientists",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/10/ukraine-war-rise-dolphin-deaths-strandings-black-sea,2022-05-10T10:22:34Z,Turkey has recorded rise in strandings across its Black Sea coast since beginning of Russian invasion,"A recent rise in dolphin deaths in the Black Sea may have been caused by the war in Ukraine, scientists have said. Researchers believe heightened noise pollution in the northern Black Sea, caused by about 20 Russian navy vessels and ongoing military activities, may have been driving cetaceans south to Turkish and Bulgarian shores, where they are being stranded or caught in fishing nets in unusually high numbers. Since the beginning of the war, Turkey has recorded a rise in strandings of the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) across its Black Sea coast. More than 80 of the animals were found dead across the country’s western Black Sea, which the Turkish Marine Research Foundation (Tudav) described as “an extraordinary increase”. Initial investigations by Tudav revealed that about half of these dolphins were killed after getting entangled in fishing nets. The fate of the other half, however, is still an “unanswered question”, according to Dr Bayram Öztürk, the chair of Tudav, as no signs of entanglement or gunshot wounds could be found on the carcasses. “Acoustic trauma is one of the possibilities that come to mind,” Öztürk said, although he stressed it was important to remain cautious. “We don’t have proof on what low frequency sonar may cause in the Black Sea because we have never seen this many ships, and this much noise for such an extended time – and science always demands proof.” Navies commonly rely on sonar to detect enemy submarines from great distances. Because marine mammals also depend on sound for communication and other functions, the underwater noise can have serious, even fatal, effects on cetaceans. According to Dr Pavel Gol’din, a researcher at Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences, while acoustic trauma may explain the strandings, constant underwater noise caused by military activities could explain the higher bycatch rate. Permanent underwater noise may not kill the animals directly, but could still seriously disturb and harm them, he said, as dolphins and other species may head for unfamiliar territory to try to avoid it. “It might be the cause of mass migration of fish and cetacean stocks to the south,” he said. Dimitar Popov, a project manager for Green Balkans, a Bulgarian conservation organisation, agrees with this theory. He has detected a similar trend in Bulgarian waters, mostly among Black Sea harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena relicta). Green Balkans has been monitoring the bycatch of cetaceans in turbot fishing for four years. Throughout this period, bycatch was lowest during spring months and peaked in summer. This spring, by contrast, Popov said, 50 cetaceans had become entangled in 72 kilometres of nets, a number close to the peak figure from summer 2019. Scientists say their investigations are hampered by the fact there are no protocols to protect marine mammals during the war. “There are dozens of ships in the Black Sea but we don’t even know how often they use sonar,” Öztürk said. The scientists say a lack of access to information is not only hindering research into cetacean deaths, but also making it hard to track which animals are most at risk. These are likely to include harbour porpoises, which should be migrating from the Black Sea towards the war-stricken Sea of Azov, as well as migratory birds that spend part of the year at the rich wetlands in the northern Black Sea.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 100 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-100-of-the-invasion,2022-06-03T01:32:19Z,Russian forces now occupy about 20% of Ukraine’s territory as Zelenskiy notes ‘some success’ in battles at Sievierodonetsk,"Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, marked the 100th day of war with a video message in front of the presidential office in Kyiv where he pledged that “victory will be ours”. Flanked by some of his closest allies, including Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, Zelenskiy said: “The leaders of parliamentary factions are here. The president’s chief of staff is here. Prime minister of Ukraine Shmyhal is here. Podolyak is here. The president is here. The armed forces of Ukraine are here. Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days. Victory shall be ours.” Russian forces currently occupy about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Zelenskiy said yesterday in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The frontlines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president said, adding that 100 Ukrainians were dying daily in eastern Ukraine, and another 450-500 people were wounded. Ukraine has had “some success” in the battles in Sievierodonetsk but it is too early to tell, according to Zelenskiy. “The situation there is the hardest now, just as in the cities and communities nearby – Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack,” he said in his latest national address. About 60% of the infrastructure and residential buildings in Lysychansk, one of only two cities in the east still under at least partial Ukrainian control, have been destroyed from attacks, according to a local official. Oleksandr Zaika, head of the Lysychansk City military-civil administration, said 20,000 people were left in the city, down from a pre-war population of 97,000. The scale of destruction in Ukraine “defies comprehension”, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said in a statement to mark the 100th day of the conflict. Thousands of people “are living with the anguish of not knowing what happened to their loved ones”, ICRC’s director general, Robert Mardini, said. About 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia had taken control of most of Sieverodonetsk, a key eastern Ukrainian city that has come under intense Russian shelling. Russia is now achieving tactical success in Donbas and controls more than 90% of Luhansk, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report released early this morning. Civilians are being urged to flee the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk as Russia bombing intensifies. With no water or electricity, 100 people heeded the mayor’s call on Thursday to evacuate. Ukrainian presidential adviser Podolyak has said Ukraine does not intend to use US-supplied weapons to attack Russian territory, and said it is disinformation from Russia to suggest they would. He said “Our partners know where their weapons are used.” Ukraine’s defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov has said he believed the Kremlin was trying to move the war into a “protracted phase” by building layered defences in occupied regions in the south of the country, primarily in Kherson. Pro-Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine said a decree had been issued to “nationalise” state assets in the south-eastern region. The deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, Andrei Trofimov, said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources, and facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February. Ukraine’s parliamentary speaker Ruslan Stefanchuk has pleaded with Germany’s chancellor Olaf Scholz during a visit to Berlin to supply Kyiv with state-of-the-art weapons systems to help it resist Russia’s advance in the east of the country. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, has said the EU stands with Ukraine as she marked 100 days since Russia’s latest invasion of the country. She said she would discuss “the EU’s current &amp; future support to the country” with French president Emmanuel Macron later today. Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko said in an interview with a local newspaper that his country was ready to discuss possible transit of Ukraine’s grain via Belarus. Kyiv’s ambassador to Ankara has said Turkey is among the countries that is buying grain that Russia stole from Ukraine. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance was in touch with Turkey to find a “united way” forward to address Ankara’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s bid to join. Stoltenberg’s latest remarks come after he told reporters yesterday that he would convene senior officials from Finland, Sweden and Turkey in Brussels in the coming days to discuss the issue. Ukraine has granted citizenship to prominent Russian journalist Alexander Nevzorov, who fled Russia in March with his wife after denouncing the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine. Russia has been seeking the arrest of Nevzorov, accusing him of spreading false information on his YouTube channel, which has over 1.8 million subscribers, after he reported Russian forces had deliberately shelled a maternity hospital in the city of Mariupol. Russia has denied the bombing, accusing Ukraine of a “staged provocation”. Russia’s foreign ministry has said it was summoning the heads of US media outlets in Moscow to a meeting next Monday to notify them of measures in response to US restrictions against Russian media. The UK has taken in fewer Ukrainian refugees per capita than all but one of 28 European countries, a Guardian analysis of official figures from across the continent has found. Seven million people have fled Ukraine for other European countries since Russia invaded on 24 February, according to the United Nations high commissioner for refugees (UNHCR). Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since president Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. The White House announced a fresh round of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian government officials and elites as well as several yachts linked to Putin. The sanctions were announced as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to the US and its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for a new $700m weapons package for Ukraine. EU ambassadors dropped the leader of Russia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, from a proposed blacklist, according to diplomats. The removal of Patriarch Kirill from the list of sanctioned individuals allows the EU to agree on a new round of sanctions after opposition from Hungary. Russia has accused the son of a Conservative MP of involvement in the killing of a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine. Russia’s national guard said one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian”, Ben Grant. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths is in Moscow on Friday to discuss clearing the way for exports of grain and other food from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Since the invasion, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of western sanctions imposed on Russia has hurt its fertiliser and grain exports. Ten Russian servicemen who looted the property of Bucha residents have been identified and reported on suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war. “Pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings is carried out by investigators of … the national police of Ukraine,” Ukraine’s prosecutor general said in a statement on Thursday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Lviv commemorates 243 dead children in Ukraine war with school buses memorial,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/lviv-commemorates-243-dead-children-in-ukraine-war-with-school-buses-memorial,2022-06-02T09:35:06Z,"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy claims more than 200,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken to Russia","The western Ukrainian city of Lviv has commemorated the children killed during the Russian invasion. Titled “excursion that will never happen”, the city’s memorial featured empty school buses with stuffed toys strapped into seats to represent each of the 243 children so far claimed to be lost in the war. On Wednesday Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, made note of International Children’s Day during his nightly video address to the nation, saying that since Russia began its latest invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Ukraine’s emergency services had counted 243 children as killed, 446 wounded and 139 missing. Zelenskiy also claimed that 200,000 children had been forcibly taken to Russia, saying: “The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return. Ukraine cannot be conquered, our people will not surrender and our children will not become the property of the occupiers.” The memorial event in Lviv took place in Rynok Square, the city’s central market. As well as the empty school buses, the streets were littered with signs saying “Caution! Children!” as a protest against the violation of children’s rights during the war. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, said the installation represented the fact that “243 Ukrainian children will never go on a field trip by bus”. One observer tweeted that the display was “heartbreaking”, saying that “no child should ever be afraid, hear the sounds of explosions, bombings. Children in Ukraine are being deprived of their childhood, their personalities are being deeply traumatised.” There was also a protest in Moscow timed to coincide with International Children’s Day, which is held on 1 June in many states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union. Protesters beamed images of children they claimed had been killed by the military actions of Ukrainian forces within the occupied Donbas region of Ukraine on to the walls of the US embassy in Moscow.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 99 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-99-of-the-invasion,2022-06-02T01:50:45Z,Russia hits back at US supply of medium-range rocket systems; Russian forces control two-thirds of Sievierodonetsk; Ukraine suffers 100 casualties a day,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed 243 children have been killed so far in the war and 200,000 children have been forcefully taken to Russia, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families. Speaking in relation to children take to Russia, he said: “The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.” In her first public speech since leaving office about six months ago, Angela Merkel has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as a “barbaric war of aggression” which amounted to a “far-reaching turning point”. She said whilst she was reluctant to give her views from the sidelines as the former German chancellor, she could not avoid talking about the most “glaring breach of international law” in the history of Europe since the end of the second world war. Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The front lines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles) Russia has taken control of most of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sieverodonetsk, the UK ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The report adds: “The main road into the Sieverodonetsk pocket likely remains under Ukrainian control but Russia continues to make steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery.” Around 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, which has come under intense Russian shelling, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. Local residents have sought shelter in the Soviet-era bomb shelters underneath the plant. The chief spokesman for Russia’s ministry of defence, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, has claimed that the number of foreign mercenaries fighting for Ukraine has halved since the the start of the war, due to Russian high-precision strikes and their own poor training. He also had a warning for those still fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine, saying “Let me remind you that in accordance with international humanitarian law, mercenaries are not combatants and the best that awaits them is criminal liability.️” Russian forces are trying to assault the east Ukrainian village of Berestove that lies on a main road linking the Luhansk region’s city of Lysychansk to the rest of Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has said. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic claims to have 222 settlements are under their control. They claim overnight ten areas of Donetsk were shelled by Ukrainian forces, and that one person was killed and 19 more were injured. Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Ukraine is working with international partners to create a United Nations-backed mission to restore Black Sea shipping routes and export Ukrainian farm produce. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will meet the head of the African Union, who is also the Senegalese president, Macky Sall, on Friday to discuss “freeing up stocks of cereals and fertilisers” and the conflict in Ukraine, Sall’s office said. The EU has dropped the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, from its new sanctions list. Diplomats are cited as saying that Patriarch Kirill has now been removed from the list of sanctioned individuals, at the request of Hungary. Slovakia will deliver eight self-propelled Zuzana 2 howitzers to Ukraine under a commercial contract which a state-controlled producer signed, the Slovak Defence Ministry has said. Ukraine’s football victory over Scotland in their Fifa World Cup playoff semi-final last night gave the country, in the words of Zelenskiy, “two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.” The US announced yesterday it will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. A Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US supports international inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine – as it happened ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/04/russia-ukraine-war-latest-ukrainians-fight-back-sievierodonetsk-putin-macron-africans-victims-food-shortages-zelenskiy-eu,2022-06-04T23:05:26Z,Local governor says Ukrainian military has ‘pushed back’ Russian forces in battle for control of the city,"This blog is closing now but we’ll be back in a few hours with more rolling coverage. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolize the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reports. Top US General Mark Milley said on Saturday that the United States is determined to support Sweden and Finland as the countries pursue Nato membership, a statement underscored by his visit to the USS Kearsarge after it became the largest US warship ever to dock in Stockholm. “It’s important for us, the United States, and it’s important for the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Milley said ahead of Nato’s annual Baltic Sea naval manoeuvres. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Severodonetsk despite Russia “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said that the Russian army has taken control over most of Severodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. Russian anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts,” said Russian president Vladimir Putin in an interview that aired on Saturday. “Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen,” Reuters reported. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced on Saturday. “Those responsible for war crimes - including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them - must face justice,” the US embassy in Kyiv tweeted on Saturday. Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, said Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. Some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from the key city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, the Russian army announced on Saturday. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Severodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk,” Severodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. A European Union decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said on Saturday. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. The EU said Aleksandra Melnichenko “takes good advantage of the fortune and benefits from the wealth of her husband”. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleagues in Australia. Thank you. Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St. Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv that symbolize the voices of killed children, Euromaidan Press reports. Top US General Mark Milley said on Saturday that the United States is determined to support Sweden and Finland as the countries pursue Nato membership, a statement underscored by his visit to the USS Kearsarge after it became the largest US warship ever to dock in Stockholm. Agence France-Presse reports: “It’s important for us, the United States, and it’s important for the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Milley said ahead of Nato’s annual Baltic Sea naval manoeuvres. He was speaking during a joint press conference with Swedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson. The “Baltops 22” naval exercise - set to run from 5 to 17 June and involving 14 Nato countries as well as Sweden and Finland - takes place this year in the shadow of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That invasion prompted the two Nordic countries to reverse decades of military nonalignment and apply for Nato membership. The presence in Stockholm of the USS Kearsarge, an amphibious assault ship designed to deploy land forces, “demonstrates commitment in a common cause, in the rules-based international order, in the idea that large countries cannot invade small countries at no cost,” said Milley, the chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff. Andersson in turn said the presence in the Swedish capital of the imposing 250-metre-long (840-foot) vessel - with a full complement of helicopters and some 1,200 Marines aboard - “is a concrete expression of the US support and also a very strong political signal at a crucial time in history”. “It also shows that the security assurances that President Biden was very outspoken on when I and President (Sauli) Niinisto visited him in the White House, is actually followed with concrete action,” the Swedish prime minister added. She and Niinisto met with Biden in Washington on 19 May. “We are very, very grateful” for such support, Andersson said. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Severodonetsk despite Russia “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, Lugansk regional governor Sergiy Gaiday said that the Russian army has taken control over most of Severodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. “The Russian army, as we understand, is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,” said Gaiday. “Our soldiers have managed to redeploy, build a line of defence,” said the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, in a televised interview broadcast on Telegram Saturday. “We are currently doing everything necessary to re-establish total control” of the city, he added, while also acknowledging that the current situation is “quite difficult,” due to fierce street fighting and artillery exchanges. At least seven civilians were reported killed in the Lugansk region where Severodonetsk is located and in the southern city of Mykolaiv, while a revered wooden church was reported to be on fire because of the fighting. Russian anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts,” said Russian president Vladimir Putin in an interview that aired on Saturday. Reuters reports: Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen. But the clip of an interview to be aired on Sunday made clear that Putin had in fact been responding to a different question, which was not shown. “Our anti-aircraft systems are crunching them like nuts. Dozens have been destroyed,” Putin said. Although the exact kind of weapon was not clear, Russia says it has destroyed both aircraft and missiles fielded by Ukraine. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced on Saturday. In a separate tweet, US ambassador Bridget Brink to Ukraine wrote, “Bearing witness to atrocities committed in Russia’s brutal war, including families killed in their own homes, only strengthens my resolve to do everything we can to hold the perpetrators of these awful crimes to account.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, said Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. Considering the price level that has been established as a result of the west’s policies, we have suffered no budgetary losses. On the contrary, this year we will significantly increase the profits from the export of our energy resources,” Tass quoted Lavrov as telling a Bosnian television station. Some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from the key city of Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, the Russian army announced on Saturday. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Severodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk,” Severodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. “The Ukrainian authorities, having realised that it was impossible to resist further and to hold on to the industrial zone of Severodonetsk, ordered a mixed tactical unit to mine the tanks containing nitrate and nitric acid in the Azot factory,” it added. Russia’s army said the remaining group of Ukrainian fighters that are still in the city includes “survivors” of the 79th Air Assault Brigade and members of the Ukrainian Territorial Defence Forces. The defense ministry went on to claim that the Ukrainian army attempted to contaminate the area and “delay” the Russian military operation. A European Union decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said on Saturday. Reuters reports: Aleksandra Melnichenko, who was born in Belgrade and holds Serbian and Croatian citizenship, will “vigorously contest the unfortunate decision against her”, the representative said in an email statement to Reuters, declining to give a name. Reuters reported last month that Melnichenko ceded ownership of coal company SUEK AO and fertilizer company EuroChem Group AG to his wife on March 8, a day before the EU put him on a sanctions list. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. The EU said Aleksandra Melnichenko “takes good advantage of the fortune and benefits from the wealth of her husband”. The step could disrupt operations at SUEK and EuroChem because the sanctions include freezing her assets. A EuroChem spokesperson said that while the company was committed to complying strictly with EU sanctions law, it would also seek to discuss with EU authorities how it could continue supplying fertilisers to farmers. “EuroChem will engage with the European Commission and table proposals to find solutions that will maintain its operations and provide crop nutrients to its customers around the world at a most critical time of food crisis,” the spokesperson said in a statement. EuroChem produces roughly 5% of world fertiliser output. Upon sanctioning Melnichenko in March, the EU accused him of being close to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Melnichenko family representative said in Saturday’s statement that the businessman has no political affiliations in Russia, calling the decision to sanction him “reckless” and “arbitrary”. Pope Francis said on Saturday he would meet soon with Ukrainian officials to discuss the possibility of a visit to their country. Francis disclosed the coming meeting in a question-and-answer session with children in one of the Vatican’s main courtyards, Reuters reports. A Ukrainian boy named Sachar asked him: “Can you come to Ukraine to save all the children who are suffering there now?” The 85-year-Francis, who has been using a wheelchair because of knee pain, responded that he often thought of Ukrainian children and wanted to visit the country but had to choose the right time. “It is not easy to make a decision that could do more harm than good to the rest of the world. I have to find the right moment to do it,” he said, according to a Vatican transcript of the event. He did not elaborate. “Next week I will receive representatives of the Ukrainian government, who will come here to talk, to talk even about an eventual visit of mine there. We’ll see what happens,” Francis said. Vladimir Putin, in comments about a US decision to send new arms to Ukraine, said Russia was easily coping and was already destroying American-supplied weapons by the dozen, state-run news agency RIA reported. Putin made the remarks in an interview with national television which is scheduled to be broadcast on Sunday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Russian artillery hit an early 17th century Ukrainian Orthodox monastery in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s Defence Ministry denied involvement, accusing Ukrainian troops of setting fire to the All Saints Monastery in Donetsk before pulling back, Reuters report. Flames could be seen ripping through the timber walls of a church with domes in footage posted by Zelenskiy on his official Telegram channel. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage. “Russian artillery struck the Svyatohirsk Lavra in the Donetsk region again today. Destroyed All Saints Monastery. It was consecrated in 1912,” the Ukrainian leader wrote. “It was first destroyed during the Soviet era. Later it was rebuilt to be burned by the Russian army.” Zelenskiy called for Russia to be expelled from the United Nations’ cultural agency Unesco and said there had been no military targets present at the site. He added: “Every church burned by Russia in Ukraine, every school blown up, every destroyed memorial proves that Russia has no place in Unesco.” Lugansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said in an interview that the invading forces had captured most of Sievierodonetsk, but that the Ukrainian military was pushing them back. “The Russian army, as we understand, is throwing all its power, all its reserves in this direction,” said Gaiday, who on Friday claimed Ukrainian troops had managed to win back a fifth of the city. Russia’s army however claimed some Ukrainian military units were withdrawing from the city. The press service of Ukraine’s presidential office said that “street fighting” was continuing in Sievierodonetsk and “assault operations are underway” in an industrial part of the city, AFP reports. As thousands of people have descended on The Mall in London to celebrate the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, a few hundred pro democracy supporters have assembled further down Whitehall. Here are more details about the death of Dmitry Kovtun, one of the two Russian men accused of assassinating the former spy and Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London, from coronavirus. Litvinenko died in 2006, weeks after drinking tea laced with the radioactive isotope polonium 210 at a London hotel, where he met Kovtun and the other suspect, Andrei Lugovoi. The case has since weighed on relations between Britain and Russia. After Litvinenko’s death, detectives found polonium in all the hotel rooms where Kovtun and Lugovoi had stayed in London, as well as on Lugovoi’s plane seat from Moscow and in numerous other locations including at Arsenal’s Emirates stadium. Finland and Sweden joining Nato would put Russia in a difficult military position in the Baltic Sea, top US general Mark Milley said. The two Nordic neighbours, which both have long borders on the Baltic Sea, applied last month to join the military alliance amid security concerns after Russia invaded Ukraine in February, although they face objections from Turkey. Their joining would mean the Baltic Sea’s coastline would, bar short strips around Russian cities Kaliningrad and St Petersburg, be encircled by Nato members, Reuters reports. So from a Russian perspective that will be very problematic for them, militarily speaking, and it would be very advantageous to Nato,” said Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “The Baltic [Sea is] very strategically important, it’s one of the great seaways of the world,” Milley added. He was speaking at a joint news conference with his Swedish counterpart, the Swedish prime minister and the Swedish defence minister ahead of an annual Nato exercise in the Baltic Sea that Sweden and Finland take part in. It is 6pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine has staged a counterattack on the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and recaptured a fifth of the city it had previously lost to Russian invaders, according to the head of the region, Serhiy Haidai. He said Russian forces were forfeiting recent gains in the city and Ukraine’s military had pushed them back by 20%. His claims are hard to verify amid the heavy fighting. Russian forces have combined airstrikes and massed artillery fires to bring its “overwhelming” firepower to bear in Donbas, the UK Ministry of Defence said in its latest intelligence report. This combined use of air and artillery strikes has been a key factor in Russia’s recent tactical successes in the region, the report reads. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There are reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack but this has not been verified. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it is vital that Russia is not humiliated so that a diplomatic solution can be found once fighting stops in Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, reacted angrily to Macron’s comments and said such calls would “only humiliate France” and others taking the same view. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened,” said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. The world faces a critical food shortage unless Russia lifts its blockade on Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, has warned. Efforts to improve other transport options in order to get its grains out by road, river and rail would be insufficient for Ukraine to deliver a fraction of its total grain stockpile, Kubrakov told the Financial Times. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with the captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Hundreds of fighters were taken into Russian custody in mid-May after being ordered to stand down. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. Ukraine’s volunteer brigade announced the deaths of four foreign military volunteers fighting Russian forces. The International Legion of Defence of Ukraine, an official volunteer brigade, announced the four men were from Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and France. They did not specify when or under what circumstances the deaths took place. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to Nadeem Badshah, who will continue to bring you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has dismissed calls by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, not to “humiliate” Russia for the sake of diplomacy. In an interview, Macron offered to mediate in the war and warned against humiliating Moscow so as to keep the door open to a diplomatic solution. In response, Kuleba said such calls “could only humiliate France and every other country that calls for it”. Kuleba tweeted: It is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives. Our Shaun Walker reports on how in towns near Russia’s border, Moscow’s influence was strong and Ukrainian was rarely spoken. The war has changed that: Gamlet Zinkivskyi grew up speaking Russian in the city of Kharkiv, just like his parents. But when Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, it was the final push for him to switch fully to Ukrainian. “Unfortunately, I grew up speaking Russian, but it’s not pleasant to speak the same language as the army that is destroying whole areas of our country,” said Zinkivskyi, a 35-year-old street artist widely known to Kharkiv residents, who usually refer to him by his first name. The switch of language is part of a broader journey towards a more pronounced Ukrainian identity for Zinkivskyi, something shared by many in the largely Russian-speaking areas of east and south Ukraine. It is a process which has become more pronounced in the past three months, but it has been brewing for some years. As a young artist, Zinkivskyi had a longstanding dream: an exhibition in Moscow. Kharkiv is just a few dozen miles from the border with Russia and has long been almost entirely Russian-speaking. Culturally, Moscow felt like the centre of the universe. But when Zinkivskyi finally made it to a gallery there in 2012, he was horrified. He said: They were obnoxious and patronising about Kharkiv and Ukraine, and frankly I thought: fuck them. He returned to Kharkiv and became more focused on the Ukrainian art scene. After the annexation of Crimea, in 2014, Zinkivskyi started trying to speak some Ukrainian with a few friends. Now he has fully switched, and for the first time is also introducing political and patriotic themes into his art. The language issue is something that comes up again and again in Kharkiv. Oleksandra Panchenko, a 22-year-old interior designer, said that since 2014 she had been trying hard to improve her Ukrainian, but conceded that she still often speaks Russian with friends. However, she is adamant that by the time she has children, she will be fluent enough to speak only Ukrainian at home. “I grew up in a Russian-language family, my kids will grow up in a Ukrainian-language family,” she said. Read the full story here: Enemy tongue: eastern Ukrainians reject their Russian birth language Here’s more on the fire at the Svyatohirsk Lavra in eastern Ukraine after it was hit by shelling this afternoon. A statement on the Ukrainian Orthodox church website said: As a result of hostilities, a large-scale fire broke out on the territory of the All Saints Hermitage of the Holy Dormition Sviatohirsk Lavra. The flames engulfed the main shrine of the monastery. Videos published on social media show flames engulfing the monastery. A tweet from the Ukrainian government shows the monastery, located near the town of Sviatohirsk in the Donetsk region, before and after it was hit. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Patriarch Kirill. Kirill is a long-serving Putin ally who has given his blessing to the war in Ukraine. The tweet claims that four monks were killed as a result of a Russian attack on the monastery. It has not been possible to verify this. Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Asked about an offer from France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, to mediate talks between Kyiv and Moscow to end the war in Ukraine, Podolyak said: ...Until we receive weapons in their full amount, until we strengthen our positions, until we push them (Russia’s forces) back as far as possible to the borders of Ukraine, there is no point in holding negotiations. Podolyak’s remarks come after another member of Ukraine’s negotiation team, David Arakhamia, said Kyiv wanted to strengthen its positions on the ground with the help of new weapons deliveries from the west before it resumes peace talks with Russia. Ukraine’s volunteer brigade announced the deaths of four foreign military volunteers fighting Russian forces and paid tribute to “their bravery, their memory and legacy”. The International Legion of Defence of Ukraine, an official volunteer brigade, announced the four men were from Germany, the Netherlands, Australia and France. They did not specify when or under what circumstances the deaths took place. In a statement, it said: We lost our brothers in combat but their bravery, their memory and legacy will forever inspire us. A Dutch citizen, Ronald Vogelaar, was buried on 21 May in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city, according to AFP. Colleagues said he had been killed several days earlier by artillery. An Australian was reported killed in May and his death was confirmed by a foreign affairs department spokesperson. He was identified as Michael Charles O’Neill, 47, in a local Tasmania newspaper. On Friday, Paris confirmed that a French volunteer fighter had been killed in combat in Ukraine, following reports that the man died in artillery fire in the Kharkiv region. In a briefing on Thursday, the Russian ministry of defence said it had “eliminated hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine”, adding that 3,500 foreign fighters were currently in the country. The ministry also warned that captured foreign soldiers would not be treated under the standards of international humanitarian law. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the US to cut ties with Russian cities on the basis that “tyrants must not be allowed to enjoy ties to the free world”. Zelenskiy was addressing the 90th annual conference of US mayors via video link, where he called on his audience to cut their connections with “twin” or “sister” city relationships. Using the examples of Chicago, which names Moscow as its sister city, as well as Jacksonville and Murmansk, San Diego and Vladivostok, as well as Albany and Tula, Zelenskiy said: Dozens of American cities maintain the so-called ‘brotherhood’ with the cities of the Russian Federation. What do these connections give you? Probably nothing. But they give Russia the opportunity to say that it is not isolated, even after beginning such a war. Since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine, 3,620 settlements have “faced Russian occupation” and Russia has aimed almost 2,500 missiles at Ukraine, Zelenskiy said. He urged mayors to take part in “the largest economic project of our time” by helping to rebuild Ukraine after the war. Zelenskiy said: I invite you, your cities, your companies, your business and professionals, to take part in this project. You can also become the people who choose to defend freedom and thus put an end to the history of tyranny. Take patronage over a city, region, or industry that has been destroyed by Russian strikes. And rebuild them with the latest technology. This may be the largest economic project of our time, which will strengthen Ukraine, each country and each company that will participate in the post-war reconstruction. A church in Donetsk has been hit by Russian shelling and has caught fire, with footage and photos circulating of the aftermath. The Skete of All Saints of Svyatohirsk Lavra was built in 1526. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said it is vital that Russia is not humiliated so that a diplomatic solution can be found once fighting stops in Ukraine. He said that his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had made a “historic and fundamental mistake” by invading Ukraine and was now “isolated”. Macron said he told Putin that he had “made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history” in an interview with regional newspapers. Macron said: I think he has isolated himself. Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path. Russia should not be “humiliated... so that the day the fighting stops we can pave a way out through diplomatic means”, he said, adding that he was “convinced that it is France’s role to be a mediating power”. Macron has spoken with Putin regularly since the Russian president ordered his troops into Ukraine. France has supported Ukraine militarily and financially but unlike many other EU leaders, Macron has not yet travelled to Ukraine to show his support. A former KGB agent who was accused of poisoning Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London has died of Covid-19, according to reports. Dmitry Kovtun, one of two Russian men accused by Britain of carrying out the poisoning in 2006, died in a Moscow hospital, according to the Russian state-owned news agency Tass. Litvinenko, a British citizen and former KGB officer who had become an outspoken opponent of Vladimir Putin, died weeks after drinking green tea laced with radioactive polonium-210 at London’s Millennium Hotel, where he met Kovtun and the other suspect, Andrei Lugovoy. Investigators found traces of polonium at sites across London where the two men had been, including in offices, hotels, planes and the Arsenal soccer stadium. From his deathbed, Litvinenko accused Putin of ordering his killing, but the Kremlin has always denied any role. Kovtun and Lugovoy denied carrying out the poisoning, and Russia refused to extradite them to face trial. Lugovoy, who is now a prominent member of Russia’s parliament, was quoted by Tass as saying he was mourning the death of a “close and faithful friend” Russian forces are blowing up bridges across the Seversky Donets river to prevent Ukraine from bringing in military reinforcements and delivering aid to civilians in Sievierodonetsk, according to the governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai. Haidai said the Ukrainian military continued to hold its positions inside the key eastern city and was pushing back Russian forces in several locations, Reuters reports. The world faces a critical food shortage unless Russia lifts its blockade on Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Ukraine’s infrastructure minister, Oleksandr Kubrakov, has warned. Ukraine and its allies are seeking ways to get some 22m tonnes of grain out of the country after Russia captured much of its southern coastline. The Russian navy now controls major transport routes in the Black Sea, blocking Ukrainian shipments and threatening tens of millions of people who rely on Ukraine’s cereals. Efforts to improve other transport options in order to get its grains out by road, river and rail would be insufficient to enable Ukraine to deliver a fraction of its total grain stockpile, Kubrakov told the Financial Times. Kubrakov said: All of our activity won’t cover even 20% of what we could do through the Black Sea ports. He added: Everyone is doing superhuman activity, and the [amount exported] is growing every month . . . in the short term it could go up to 30% [of Ukraine’s Black Sea exporting capacity]. Russia’s blockade risked creating famine “on a global scale”, Kubrakov said, accusing Moscow of acting like “total pirates”. Kubrakov said: They don’t care about the lives of these people in Africa. They’re telling them: ‘We don’t care about you. We are only worried about sanctions against us. Now you are hostages.’ Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, yesterday denied Moscow was preventing Ukrainian ports from exporting grain, calling reports of a Russian export ban a “bluff” from western nations. Ukrainian negotiator, David Arakhamia, said Kyiv wants to strengthen its positions on the ground with the help of new weapons deliveries from the west before it resumes peace talks with Russia. Speaking on national television yesterday, Arakhamia said: Our armed forces are ready to use (the new weapons)...and then I think we can initiate a new round of talks from a strengthened position. A quick snap from Reuters, also from Odesa in southern Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry said it shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane carrying weapons and munitions near the Black Sea port. Russian missiles also struck an artillery training centre in Ukraine’s Sumy region where foreign instructors worked, the ministry said. It also claimed another missile strike destroyed a “foreign mercenaries’” outpost in the Odesa region. It has not been possible to independently verify these claims. A Russian missile struck an agricultural building in the southern Ukrainian region of Odesa this morning, wounding two people, according to a local official. Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesperson for the Odesa regional military administration, said on Telegram: The morn",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ng in Odesa began with a missile strike. Strategic aviation aircraft of the Russian Federation launched a cruise missile attack on one of the districts of the Odesa region. A Ha-59 type missile hit an agricultural enterprise. According to preliminary information, two people were injured. A team is investigating the incident and rescuers have put out the resulting fire, he added. He also noted that several ships carrying cruise missiles continued to be in the Black Sea, adding that Russian forces were trying to strengthen their foothold on Snake Island. Ukraine now controls around half of the key eastern city of Sievierodonetsk after recapturing 20% of the territory they had lost to Russian forces, according to the head of the eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai. Russia had “previously managed to capture most of the city”, he said, “but now our military has pushed them back. They are really suffering huge losses”. Speaking on national television, Haidai said: They are moving forward step-by-step. They are simply destroying everything with artillery, aircraft, mortars, tanks. But as soon as we have enough Western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run. The situation in the region as a whole remained “difficult”, with Sievierodonetsk “now just a concentration of hostilities” because the Russian army “is throwing all its reserves into this direction”, Haidai said. It has not been possible to independently verify his claims. Our Dan Sabbagh is in the Ukrainian capital where he has shared images of Russian wreckage displayed for the public, “safe now for children to play on, and for adults to peer at”. Russian forces have combined airstrikes and massed artillery fires to bring its “overwhelming” firepower to bear in Donbas, the UK Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence report released this morning. This combined use of air and artillery strikes has been a key factor in Russia’s recent tactical successes in the region, the report reads. Russian air activity remains high over contested ground in the Donbas with Russian aircraft conducting strikes using both guided and unguided munitions. Russian air activity has been “largely restricted to deep strikes using air and surface launched cruise missiles” to disrupt the movement of Ukrainian reinforcements and supplies, the report says. These strikes alone however have failed to have a meaningful impact on the conflict and Russian stocks of precision guided missiles are likely to have been significantly depleted as a result. After switching its focus to Donbas, Russian forces have been able to “increase its employment of tactical air to support its creeping advance, combining airstrikes and massed artillery fires to bring its overwhelming firepower to bear,” the ministry said. The combined use of air and artillery strikes has been a key factor in Russia’s recent tactical successes in the region. The increased use of unguided munitions has led to the widespread destruction of built-up areas in the Donbas and has almost certainly caused substantial collateral damage and civilian casualties. Good morning from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong, here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Please feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with the captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Hundreds of fighters were taken into Russian custody in mid-May after being ordered to stand down. They had spent weeks holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks. Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that Russia had reinforced its troops and had used artillery to conduct “assault operations” in Sievierodonetsk. On Friday, Ukraine said its forces had recaptured about 20% of the territory they lost in the city. The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War reports that Russian occupation authorities have begun issuing Russian passports in Kherson City and Melitopol, but adds “they continue to face challenges establishing societal control over occupied territories”. Russian troops now occupy a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, according to Agence France-Presse, and Moscow has imposed a blockade on its Black Sea ports. However, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was defiant on Friday, stating “victory shall be ours”. Vladimir Putin says exporting grain from Ukraine is “no problem”, after Moscow’s invasion raised fears of a global food crisis. The Russian president said in a televised interview on Friday that exporting could be done via Ukrainian ports, via others under Russian control, or even via central Europe. Putin accused the west of “bluster” by claiming Moscow was preventing the grain exports from Ukraine. The African Union head and Senegalese president, Macky Sall, said he was “reassured” after meeting Putin in Sochi regarding food shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, he told Putin that Africans were the victims of the war in Ukraine. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with the captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskiy said late on Friday, according to a Reuters report. Uncertainty has surrounded the fate of hundreds of fighters who were taken into Russian custody in mid-May after being ordered to stand down. They had spent weeks holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks, as Russian forces took control of the rest of the city. Many had serious injuries, with limited medical care and dwindling supplies. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. In comments made to Ukrainian television on Friday, Monastyrskiy said: It is through them [intelligence services] that we are learning about the conditions of the detention, nutrition and the possibility of their release. We all know that they will all be here, in Kyiv, and we are doing everything possible to do so.” The Kremlin has said the fighters who surrendered will be treated according to international standards. In its latest analysis, the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War reports that Russian occupation authorities have begun issuing Russian passports in Kherson and Melitopol, but adds “they continue to face challenges establishing societal control over occupied territories and ending Ukrainian partisan actions”. ISW also provides the following commentary on the conflict: • Russian forces conducted unsuccessful assaults southeast and southwest of Izyum and west of Lyman but remain unlikely to secure major advances towards Slovyansk. • Russian forces made minor gains in the eastern part of Sievierodonetsk, but Ukrainian forces continues to launch localized counterattacks. • Russian forces did not attempt to launch assaults on Avdiivka. • Russian forces failed to regain lost positions in northeastern Kherson Oblast and continued to defend previously occupied positions. More than 1,400 cases of treason and collaboration with the Russian army have been brought against Ukrainian citizens. Guardian correspondents Lorenzo Tondo and Shaun Walker in Kharkiv report on the difficult decisions facing prosecutors. For the Ukrainian authorities, it is important to show that punishment for those who helped the Russian invasion will be swift and stern. But at the same time, the process comes with lots of tricky questions. These include whether Ukraine’s prosecutors and judges, who for years have battled accusations of corruption and nepotism, can be trusted not to abuse the process. Numerous high-ranking officials may also be asked questions about negligence at the beginning of the invasion, or even treason. Ukraine’s military said on Saturday that Russia had reinforced its troops and had used artillery to conduct “assault operations” in Sievierodonetsk, Reuters has reported. But Russian forces had retreated after failed attempts to advance in the nearby town of Bakhmut and cut off access to Sievierodonetsk, Ukraine military said. On Friday, Serhiy Gaidai, the head of the eastern region of Luhansk, said on national television that Ukrainian forces have recaptured around 20% of the territory they lost in Sievierodonetsk. From Odesa, Guardian correspondent Luke Harding reports on calls for a campaign of “de-Russification” once Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine comes to an end. Ukraine has already twice dismantled Soviet-era state symbols. In the 1990s many Lenin statues were removed, including those in Odesa. Kyiv’s parliament embarked on a further round of “decommunisation” in 2014 after the Maidan uprising against the country’s pro-Moscow president, Viktor Yanukovych, and Putin’s annexation of Crimea and his war in the eastern Donbas region. In Russian-occupied areas this process is going into reverse. In April Russian troops erected a new statue of Lenin outside the main administration building in the southern city of Henichesk, in Kherson province. They have torn down blue-and-yellow Ukrainian flags from municipal buildings and hung Russian and Soviet ones in their place. This “re-Russification” is part of Putin’s attempt to erase Ukraine, Kyiv says. Images taken in Ukraine over the past 24 hours show the devastation of the war, defiance and a longing for peace. Hello, I’m Rebecca Ratcliffe and welcome to our rolling coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are some of the key developments of the past few hours. Ukrainian forces have recaptured around 20% of the territory they lost in Sievierodonetsk since Russia’s invasion, according to Ukrainian officials. “Whereas before the situation was difficult, the percentage [held by Russia] was somewhere around 70%, now we have already pushed them back by approximately 20%,” Serhiy Gaidai, the head of the eastern region of Luhansk, announced on national television on Friday. “Victory shall be ours,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video featuring the same key ministers and advisers who appeared with him in a defiant broadcast on 24 February, the day his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, launched his unprovoked assault. “The armed forces of Ukraine are here. Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days already … Glory to Ukraine,” Zelenskiy added. Vladimir Putin says exporting grain from Ukraine is “no problem”, after Moscow’s invasion raised fears of a global food crisis. The Russian president said in a televised interview on Friday that exporting could be done via Ukrainian ports, via others under Russian control, or even via central Europe. Putin accused the west of “bluster” by claiming Moscow was preventing the grain exports from Ukraine. The African Union head and Senegalese president, Macky Sall, said he was “reassured” after meeting with Putin in Sochi regarding food shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. However, he told Putin that Africans were the victims of the war in Ukraine. Leading US general Mark Milley has met Finnish president Sauli Niinisto to pledge US support for Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato membership bids, which Turkey is blocking. Milley told reporters it was clear that, if the two countries’ applications were approved, “they will bring a significant increase in the military capability of Nato”, Agence France-Presse reported. After Helsinki, Milley was expected to visit neighbouring Sweden on Saturday. European president Ursula von der Leyen said that Ukraine must meet all the necessary standards and conditions for accession. She went on to call on the EU to help Ukraine achieve its goals. A driver transporting two Reuters journalists in eastern Ukraine was killed and the two reporters lightly wounded on Friday, a company spokesperson said. They had come under fire while en route to Severodonetsk. “They were travelling in a vehicle provided by the Russian-backed separatists and driven by an individual assigned by the separatists,” the international news agency said. French president Emmanuel Macron says Putin has committed a “historic and fundamental error” by invading Ukraine and is now “isolated”. “I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,” Macron said in an interview with French regional media on Friday. “Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path”. 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, the majority women and children, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said on Friday. In a statement released on the 100th day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Awad spoke of displaced Ukrainians, describing the “scale and speed of [their] displacement not witnessed in history”. Moscow will help restore and rebuild Luhansk and Donetsk, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced on Friday after a visit to Luhansk. About 1,500 specialists from various departments of the Moscow municipal economy complex and 500 pieces of equipment had arrived in Luhansk, the mayor said. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodna, accused Russia of “stealing” and sending Ukrainian grain abroad. “Russia shamelessly steals Ukrainian grain and sends it overseas from Crimea, including to Turkey,"” Bodna said in a tweet on Friday.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine: UK justice ministry offers more support for ICC war crimes investigation,https://www.theguardian.com/law/2022/jun/06/ukraine-uk-justice-ministry-more-support-icc-war-crimes-investigation,2022-06-06T12:18:03Z,"Dominic Raab to unveil new raft of measures, which include providing court with a specialist legal and police team","The UK Ministry of Justice has announced a second tranche of support for the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigations into war crimes in Ukraine, including the deployment of a specialist legal and police team. Karim Khan QC, the court’s chief prosecutor, was due in London on Monday to provide an update on the progress of the investigation, although his trip was later cancelled due to illness. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, will present further support to the independent investigation on top of the £1m of funding provided earlier this year. The package includes a police liaison officer based in The Hague to lead on information sharing between the UK and the ICC, and seven legal experts to support the ICC with expertise in international criminal law and the handling of evidence to be presented to court. The UK will also provide two police officers with expertise in the collection of intelligence through publicly available data sources, ongoing defence analysis and monitoring of events in Ukraine, as well as war crimes investigation training to Ukrainian police on behalf of the ICC, in collaboration with Norwegian police. “The UK has responded swiftly to a request from the international criminal court for more police and lawyers to aid their investigation into Russian war crimes in Ukraine,” Raab said. “Russian forces should know that they will be held to account for their actions and the global community will work together to ensure justice is served.” The attorney general, Suella Braverman, added: “Following my appointment of war crimes expert Sir Howard Morrison as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, I am determined that British expertise continues to be available to our friends in Ukraine in their search for justice. “We will stand side by side as they uncover the truth and hold those responsible in Putin’s regime to account for their actions.” The ICC launched its war crimes investigation into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. The referral by 39 countries shaved several months off the process because it allowed Khan to bypass the need to seek the approval of the court in The Hague. The British lawyer previously said the push for an inquiry by so many countries “allows us to jump-start investigations” and came on top of “evidence of international concern over events on the ground in Ukraine”. “Individuals have rights to have their interests vindicated and for justice to prevail,” he said. “That can only take place if evidence is independently and impartially collected and assessed and then, in due course, decisions can be made regarding whether or not there’s criminal responsibility, and then the judges ultimately will decide.” The ICC investigation will look back as far as 21 November 2013, when Ukraine’s then president – Viktor Yanukovych – rejected closer integration with the EU, leading to huge protests that precipitated Russia’s annexation of Crimea. Earlier this month, Braverman visited Ukraine and led a delegation of war crimes experts to the region to support the work of the Ukrainian prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, the Ministry of Justice said. It added that officers from the Metropolitan police’s counterterrorism unit would “continue to provide forensic and technical capabilities, such as biometrics and examination of digital devices”, as evidence is gathered from potential witnesses in the UK. The Ministry of Justice is also accelerating conversations with City law firms and barristers to prepare for deployment at a later stage of the investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 103 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-103-of-the-invasion,2022-06-06T00:40:03Z,Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles as Kyiv reels from first attack in more than a month,"President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, where Ukraine claims to be fighting back in one of the war’s biggest ground battles. Russian forces continue to storm the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and fired missiles at the nearby cities of Sloviansk, Lysychansk and Orikhove, Ukraine’s military has said. Russian troops fired at Ukrainian units defending Sievierodonetsk with mortars and artillery fire, damaging infrastructure in the towns of Metolkino, Borivske, Ustynivka and Toshkivka. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has reported today that the situation has worsened a little for Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk and that there is intense street fighting. He told national television “Our defenders managed to undertake a counterattack for a certain time; they liberated almost half of the city. But now the situation has worsened a little for us again.” Haidai also said that “the number of shellings in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk increased tenfold. In the Luhansk region there are many cities with a situation comparable to Mariupol: Now the Russians are levelling Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.” Ukraine has concentrated enough forces to repel Russian attacks in Sievierodonetsk but neither side is preparing to withdraw, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk. A total of 262 children have been killed and 467 injured since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to newly released figures from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. Zelenskiy, said there could be as much as 75 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine by this autumn, and that Kyiv wanted anti-ship weapons that could secure the safe passage of its exports. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has urged countries not to trust Vladimir Putin’s promises not to use trade routes to attack the southern port city of Odesa. Oleksandr Senkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has reported on Telegram that there have been explosions in the city. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has posted to Telegram to say that one person has been killed and five people have been injured in the last 24 hours by Ukrainian shelling into the occupied territory of Donetsk. The Russian missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday was likely an attempt to disrupt the supply of western military equipment to frontline Ukrainian units, according to British intelligence. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would respond to western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine by pushing back Kyiv’s forces further from Russia’s borders. Anthony Albanese, Australia’s new prime minister, has confirmed Australia will attend the G20 meeting in Bali in November despite Russia’s controversial attendance at the summit. Russia should not close the US embassy in Moscow despite the crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine because the world’s two biggest nuclear powers must continue to talk, the US ambassador to Moscow John J Sullivan was quoted as saying. The UK ministry of justice has announced a second tranche of support for the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigations into war crimes in Ukraine, including the deployment of a specialist legal and police team. A Moscow court has fined US-backed broadcaster Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe 20m roubles (£260,000/$325,214) over what it deems to be “fake” content about Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine Nato kicked off a nearly two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, air personnel and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden – who aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. The Kremlin has described the move as a “hostile action”. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support, according to government sources cited by newspaper El País. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption.

Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 98 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-98-of-the-invasion,2022-06-01T00:45:09Z,Sievierodonetsk mostly under Russian control; Russia further cuts gas supplies to Europe; seed bank in Kharkiv at risk,"Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.” US President Joe Biden has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.” President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. The UK’s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.” Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children’s Day. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, chancellor Olaf Scholz said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Switzerland’s government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued. Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security, said on Telegram that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business. Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU’s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports. Ukraine’s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing. Read more of the Guardian’s coverage how vital seed banks are in the climate crisis here and here.

Vadim Shysimarin, a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, arrived at Kyiv’s small district court No 3 in a grey and blue tracksuit and handcuffs for a preliminary hearing. The 21-year-old is charged with premeditated murder of a 62-year-old man who was not named in court. Shysimarin is being held in Ukrainian custody. The case is scheduled to resume on Wednesday. Shysimarin’s lawyer said his client had confessed to killing the victim but had not yet discussed whether to plead guilty. The defendant, who was helped by a Russian interpreter to follow the hearing, spoke briefly to confirm his name and that he understood the charges against him. “Yes, I understand,” he said. It is alleged that Shysimarin had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee. Shysimarin, who is from the city of Ust Illyinsk, in the south-eastern Russian region of Irkutsk, shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The trial is another propaganda triumph for Kyiv, and comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine’s general prosecutor surpassed 11,200 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children were killed in the war in April alone. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his Thursday night address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 healthcare facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. “What for? It’s nonsense. It’s barbarity,” he said. In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others were wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Two further unnamed soldiers are expected to have a first hearing within days on allegations that they used a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher to carry out artillery shelling of homes and civilian buildings in the village of Kozacha Lopan, in Kharkiv district. They also allegedly hit an “educational institution” in the city of Dergachiv from Belgorod in Russia. The soldiers later crossed over the border into Ukraine and continued shelling targets in the Kharkiv region, it is claimed, and they were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces and now await trial. In another case, which is likely to he heard in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov is accused of breaking into a house in a village in the Brovarsky region in March, murdering a man and repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her child with violence and weapons”. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman and it is understood prosecutors believe they know his identity.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 95 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-95-of-the-invasion,2022-05-29T01:05:23Z,"Ukraine pleads for heavy weapons as Russia advances in the east, claiming to have captured strategically important Lyman","Ukraine is urgently pleading for heavy weapons to repel Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region, as relentless Russian artillery and airstrikes threaten to turn the tide of the war and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping. Ukrainian officials say they urgently need advanced US-made mobile multiple launch rocket systems, which are capable of striking targets up to 300km away, to halt Russian advances in Luhansk and Donetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that not all the land that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014 can be recaptured militarily. While he is certain his country will take back the territory Russia has claimed since its 24 February invasion, he said other territory could not be recovered by force. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry claims to have captured the strategically important city of Lyman and several other smaller towns and encircled Sievierodonetsk, which Ukraine denies. Zelenskiy said in a Saturday night television address that conditions in Donbas were “indescribably difficult”, and thanked Ukrainian defenders holding out in the face of the onslaught. At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned Russian oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems, vanishing from the global maps used to locate marine traffic. The owners of these yachts will almost certainly realise they are at risk of being targeted in a global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has scrapped the upper age limit for military recruits in the face of mounting losses in Ukraine, Tass reported. UK intelligence estimated this month Russia had lost about a third of its ground forces. Officials in the south-eastern port city of Mykolaiv said at least one person was killed, and at least six injured, in Russian shelling. Two rounds landed in courtyards of high-rise buildings, and one shell fell close to a kindergarten, CNN reported. Boris Johnson and Zelenskiy discussed concerns over food supplies in a phone call. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Zelenskiy the UK would continue to support Ukraine’s armed resistance, including by supplying equipment. She added that the UK was involved in “intensive work … with international partners to find ways to resume the export of grain from Ukraine to avert a global food crisis”. Putin spoke to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz and, according to the Kremlin, he told them that continuing arms supplies was “dangerous”, warning “of the risks of further destabilisation of the situation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis”. Russia said it was willing to discuss ways to make it possible for Ukraine to resume shipments of grain from Black Sea ports.

Officials close to the Kremlin have said confidence has spread to the leadership of United Russia, the country’s ruling party, that a full-scale victory in Ukraine is possible before the end of the year. The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces. “The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” the governor of Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. The Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire. The Luhansk governor has said Ukrainian forces may be forced to retreat from the zone to avoid being captured. “The Russians will not be able to capture Luhansk region in the coming days as analysts have predicted,” Haidai posted on Telegram, adding: “However it is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat.” The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said the situation in Donbas is “very difficult”. In a short video address, he said Russian forces are concentrated in the coastal region of Ukraine and using “maximum artillery” reserves. The Austrian chancellor, Karl Nehammer, has stated that Vladimir Putin is “prepared to discuss a prisoner swap with Ukraine”, after holding talks with the Russian president. Nehammer also said Putin had “given signals that he is quite willing to allow exports via the seaports”, adding: “The real willingness will only become apparent when it ... is actually implemented.” Russia expects to receive 1tn rubles ($14bn) in additional oil and gas revenues this year, the country’s finance minister announced, noting that the additional income will be spent on Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. The US president, Joe Biden, accused Putin of attempting to “wipe out” Ukrainian culture and identity during a speech. Biden also said that Putin inadvertently “Nato-ized all of Europe” after Sweden and Finland sought out membership in the alliance following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The US is expected to send long-range rocket systems to Ukraine that could be announced as early as next week, reports CNN. The rocket systems, multiple launch rocket system or MLRS, have been a top request of Ukraine officials who say it is necessary to ward off Russia’s advancements. More than 100 Russian national guardsmen have been fired for refusing to fight in Ukraine, court documents show. The cases of the 115 national guardsmen, a force also known as Rosgvardia, appear to be the clearest indication yet of dissent among some parts of Russia’s security forces over the invasion of New UN figures have revealed that 4,031 civilians have died since Russia first invaded Ukraine in February, including 261 children.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Leading US general Mark Milley met Finnish president Sauli Niinisto on Friday to pledge US support for Finland’s and Sweden’s Nato membership bids, which Turkey is blocking. Milley told reporters it was clear that if the two countries’ applications were approved “they will bring a significant increase in the military capability of Nato”, Agence France-Presse reported. After Helsinki, Milley was expected to visit neighbouring Sweden on Saturday. A driver transporting two Reuters journalists in eastern Ukraine was killed and the two reporters lightly wounded on Friday, a company spokesperson said. They had come under fire while en route to Severodonetsk. “They were travelling in a vehicle provided by the Russian-backed separatists and driven by an individual assigned by the separatists,” the international news agency said. Vladimir Putin says exporting grain from Ukraine is “no problem”, after Moscow’s invasion raised fears of a global food crisis. The Russian president said in a televised interview on Friday that exporting could be done via Ukrainian ports, via others under Russian control, or even via central Europe. Putin accused the west of “bluster” by claiming Moscow was preventing the grain exports from Ukraine. The African Union head and Senegalese president, Macky Sall, said he was “reassured” after meeting with Putin regarding global food shortages caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Other issues discussed between the two leaders included grain supplies that are stuck in Ukrainian ports. Ukraine’s ambassador to Ankara, Vasyl Bodna, accused Russia of “stealing” and sending Ukrainian grain abroad. “Russia shamelessly steals Ukrainian grain and sends it overseas from Crimea, including to Turkey,” Bodna said in a tweet on Friday. 14 million Ukrainians have been forced to flee their homes, the majority women and children, the UN Crisis Coordinator for Ukraine, Amin Awad, said on Friday. In a statement released on the 100th day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Awad spoke of displaced Ukrainians, describing the “scale and speed of [their] displacement not witnessed in history”. Moscow will help restore and rebuild Luhansk and Donetsk, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced on Friday after a visit to Luhansk. About 1,500 specialists from various departments of the Moscow municipal economy complex and 500 pieces of equipment had arrived in Luhansk, the mayor said. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that Ukraine must meet all the necessary standards and conditions for accession. She went on to call on the EU to help Ukraine achieve its goals. “Victory shall be ours,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video featuring the same key ministers and advisers who appeared with him in a defiant broadcast on 24 February, the day Putin launched his assault. “The armed forces of Ukraine are here,” Zelenskiy added. “Most importantly, our people, the people of our country, are here. We have been defending Ukraine for 100 days already … Glory to Ukraine.” French president Emmanuel Macron says Putin has committed a “historic and fundamental error” by invading Ukraine and is now “isolated”. “I think, and I told him, that he made a historic and fundamental error for his people, for himself and for history,” Macron said in an interview with French regional media on Friday. He said he did not “rule out” a visit to Kyiv. Switzerland’s government has rejected a request by Denmark to send nearly two-dozen Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine.

Russia has continued to make incremental gains in the Donbas region, backed by shelling. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russian forces have surrounded two-thirds of Sievierodonetsk. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east. He said Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality it would probably be necessary to end the war. Russia did not appear to be ready for serious peace talks, he added. More than 30 leading legal scholars and genocide experts concluded that Russia is inciting genocide in Ukraine and committing atrocities intended to destroy the Ukrainian people. Their independent report accused the Russian state of violating several articles of the UN Genocide Convention, according to CNN. The Kremlin blamed Ukraine for frozen peace talks, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused the leadership in Kyiv of making “contradictory statements” that do “not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants”. Ukrainian authorities have issued contradictory statements about their control over the strategic city of Lyman in Donetsk. A presidential adviser said he had unverified information that Ukraine had lost Lyman, while Ukraine’s armed forces said Russian troops were trying to strengthen their positions in the city. The governor of the region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence. Russian media reported that pro-Russian separatists had seized the city. Ten people were killed and at least 35 were injured after Russian missile strikes hit the Dnipropetrovsk region in central-eastern Ukraine on Friday morning, according to reports. Regional governor, Valentyn Reznichenko, said rescuers were working in the rubble to look for possible survivors in the aftermath of “an unquiet night and an unquiet morning”. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, said Russia was making “slow but palpable progress” in Donbas. He said Ukraine should be supplied with long-range multiple launch rocket systems to help Kyiv’s embattled forces, but stopped short of committing the UK to send the powerful M270 rocket system, which Kyiv has been pleading for from Britain, the US and other Nato members for several weeks. Kharkiv was hit by new strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 were injured, authorities said. Residents have been urged to shelter. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said “doctors are providing all necessary assistance” and that there were no further casualties overnight. Officials in Ukraine have admitted Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region said only 5% of the area remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20m tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. “Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace,” he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Oleksiy Arestovych, a presidential adviser, added: “No one is going to trade a gram of our sovereignty or a millimetre of our territory. Our children are dying, soldiers are being blown apart by shells, and they tell us to sacrifice territory. Get lost. It’s never going to happen.” There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by Tass news agency as saying. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has said they cannot yet be 100% sure they have flushed every last Ukrainian fighter out of the Azovstal steel plant. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine”. He is reported to have said “Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation.” Russia’s Ministry of Defence claims that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled. Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion. Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war. Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has said fighting is most intense in the Izyum region. He claimed “The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk.” Police in Lysychansk are collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Some 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added, Reuters reports. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.” A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.” Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he believes Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. He said everyone in the world understands it is not “a special operation”, but that it is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. German chancellor Olaf Scholz has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a thunderbolt, and that Russian president Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 89 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-89-of-the-invasion,2022-05-23T00:01:02Z,Kyiv says it will not agree to a ceasefire that involves handing territory to Russia; Ukrainian president says up to 100 Ukrainians dying every day on eastern front,"A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia’s 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing the 62-year-old man in the northeastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February after being ordered to shoot at him from a car. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko has said that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”. Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last night that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Donetsk’s self-proclaimed separatist leader Denis Pushilin has said that “The prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia was concerned by the trial of a Russian serviceman in Kyiv charged with war crimes, adding that it could not defend his interests in person. Peskov also warned that Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He proposed a full oil embargo and cutting off all of Russia’s banks from the international monetary system. Zelenskiy suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report. A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine. Belarus’s army has begun checking its weaponry and logistics equipment to make sure they are combat-ready, its ministry of defence said, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said the army was carrying out checks on equipment in long-term storage. “The inspection will determine the condition of the equipment and its readiness to carry out its tasks,” it said. Lithuania has called for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years”, France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying,” Clément Beaune said. “It’s probably in 15 or 20 years. It takes a long time.” Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since, “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from president Vladimir Putin’s military. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.

The ministry said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. In Mykolaiv, in the south, Russian rockets reportedly struck a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka. Severodonetsk is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities”, the UK Ministry of Defence said on Sunday. Russia is deploying Terminator tanks to the area, the MoD has said. Severodonetsk has been attacked from “four separate directions”, said the region’s governor. Serhiy Haidai said Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has accused Russia of blocking the export of 22m tonnes of food. The Ukrainian president also said an energy crisis would swiftly follow a food crisis if Ukraine was not given help to unlock its ports. Only Ukraine has the right to decide its future, the Polish president told lawmakers in Kyiv on Sunday. Andrzej Duda said: “Worrying voices have appeared, saying that Ukraine should give in to Putin’s demands. Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future … nothing about you without you.” Duda became the first foreign leader to give a speech in person to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia’s invasion. Russia’s state gas company, Gazprom, halted gas exports to Finland, which refused Moscow’s demands to pay in roubles for Russian gas after western countries imposed sanctions. Gasum, Finland’s state-owned energy company, said it would use other sources, such as the Balticconnector pipeline, which links Finland to its fellow EU member Estonia. Ukraine has suggested it is willing to resume talks with Russia. Speaking on Saturday, Zelenskiy said: “Discussions between Ukraine and Russia will undoubtedly take place … under what format I don’t know … but the war will be bloody, there will be fighting and [it] will only definitively end through diplomacy.” He added: “We want everything back. And the Russian Federation doesn’t want to return anything. That’s why the ending will be at the negotiating table.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, he added. “The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now.” Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building. The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.” The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building. Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation. Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers found in formerly occupied towns in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war or for Ukrainian bodies. In Kharkiv, 60 bodies were retrieved and stacked in a refrigerated rail carriage, Reuters reports. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park which was hit by about 50 shells in three months of war. “Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crimes. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko said. A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that only 10% of respondents found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace. Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. Turkey’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting. A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”.

"Ukraine invasion may be start of ‘third world war’, says George Soros",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/ukraine-invasion-may-be-start-of-third-world-war-says-george-soros,2022-05-24T18:24:24Z,Veteran philanthropist tells World Economic Forum civilisation ‘may not survive’ what is coming,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned. In a ferocious attack on Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Soros warned that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression. Soros, who has become a hate figure for the hard right in the US, also heavily criticised the former German chancellor Angela Merkel for cosying up to Moscow and Beijing. With the mood in Davos already downbeat due to the war in Ukraine, Soros ramped up the gloomy rhetoric to new heights. “The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said. “The invasion of Ukraine didn’t come out of the blue. The world has been increasingly engaged in a struggle between two systems of governance that are diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society.” The 91-year-old former hedge fund owner said the tide had started to turn against open societies in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the US in 2001. “Repressive regimes are now in the ascendant and open societies are under siege. Today China and Russia present the greatest threat to open society.” Soros, who led the speculative financial attack that drove the pound out of the European exchange rate mechanism 30 years ago, said Europe had responded well to the crisis triggered by Russia’s invasion. “It will take a long time to work out the details, but Europe seems to be moving in the right direction. It has responded to the invasion of Ukraine with greater speed, unity and vigour than ever before in its history.” He added: “But Europe’s dependence on Russian fossil fuels remains excessive, due largely to the mercantilist policies pursued by former chancellor Angela Merkel. She had made special deals with Russia for the supply of gas and made China Germany’s largest export market. That made Germany the best performing economy in Europe but now there is a heavy price to pay. Germany’s economy needs to be reoriented. And that will take a long time.” Soros said Putin had won Xi’s agreement to the Russian invasion at the opening of the Beijing Winter Olympics in early February. But he insisted the Chinese leader was not as strong as he believed. “Xi harbours a guilty secret. He never told the Chinese people that they had been inoculated with a vaccine that was designed for the original Wuhan variant and offers very little protection against new variants.” Soros said Xi was unable to “come clean” because he was at a delicate moment in his career. “His second term in office expires in the fall of 2022 and he wants to be appointed to an unprecedented third term, eventually making him ruler for life.” China’s lockdowns to combat Covid-19 had pushed the economy into freefall but Xi was unable to admit he had made a mistake, he said. “Coming on top of the real estate crisis the damage will be so great that it will affect the global economy. With the disruption of supply chains, global inflation is liable to turn into global depression.” Contrary to general expectations, Xi may not get his coveted third term because of the mistakes he had made, Soros predicted. “While the war rages, the fight against climate change has to take second place. Yet the experts tell us that we have already fallen far behind, and climate change is on the verge of becoming irreversible. That could be the end of our civilisation. “Therefore, we must mobilise all our resources to bring the war to an early end. The best and perhaps only way to preserve our civilisation is to defeat Putin as soon as possible. That’s the bottom line.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s ministry of defence claims to have destroyed a warehouse full of ammunition in Razdolovka which was stockpiling 155mm shells manufactured for American-made M-777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine. Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Sieverodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine and is not “chasing deadlines”. “All the goals set by the president will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise,” he said. The Russia-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Kherson region will ask Moscow to set up a military base on its territory, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reports. Russia successfully seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in mid-March which is adjacent to Crimea, the peninsula which Moscow has controlled since 2014. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.” A team of Colombian soldiers will travel to Europe to train their Ukrainian counterparts on de-mining techniques, the South American country’s defence minister has said. Finland and Sweden will send delegations to Ankara tomorrow to try to resolve Turkish opposition to their applications for membership of the Nato military alliance, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto has said. Poland has continued to signal its intent to bolster its defences in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Defence secretary Mariusz Blaszczak said the country intends to buy six additional Patriot missile batteries. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, says the war on Ukraine is putting the international order into question. She said the World Economic Forum at Davos should be talking about making the world better together, but instead they must talk about Putin’s invasion, where Russia’s playbook for the war “comes out of another century”. To rebuild Ukraine, she said “We should leave no stone unturned, including possibly using the Russian assets we have frozen.” A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over the invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers were due to face war crimes trials, she said, and Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a Harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, said Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary. The new security packages included “critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”. Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. “Low-level” discussions were under way on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days”, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. Robert Habeck also told German broadcaster ZDF that the European Commission and the US were working on a proposal to cap global oil prices rather than pay “any price”. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain. The pictures released by Maxar Technologies seemingly back up claims from Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business there. The Seattle-based coffee company has 130 stores and nearly 2,000 employees in Russia.

What hope is there for diplomacy in ending the Russia-Ukraine war?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/what-hope-is-there-for-diplomacy-in-ending-the-russia-ukraine-war,2022-05-27T04:00:07Z,"Analysis: Western leaders are divided on arming Ukraine, oil embargoes and whether Kyiv will have to accept territory loss","An increasingly bitter diplomatic row over Germany’s unwillingness to supply heavy weaponry to Ukraine threatened to spill into a wider dispute between allies over whether they are prepared to accept a peace settlement that leaves Vladimir Putin capable of claiming victory. One western official said western leaders are divided between those who think they can work with Vladimir Putin’s Russia once the war is over, and those who think they cannot. The row is leading to disputes over the arming of Ukraine, the feasibility of enforcing a Russian oil import embargo and whether Kyiv will have to accept a further loss of territory at the end of the war as the price for peace. The immediate point of conflict between Ukraine and some of its allies focusses on the supply of weaponry to Ukraine, and the heavy weather Germany seems to be making in setting up an elaborate chain that would see the country supplying armaments to its Eastern neighbours – principally Poland and the Czech Republic – that would in turn send armoury on to Ukraine. Kyiv is suffering serious losses due to the absence of long-range weaponry. The commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, Valerii Zaluzhnyi, said the delivery of weapons could not be delayed: “We are in great need of weapons that will make it possible to hit the enemy from a long distance.” Citing its sources in Nato, the national news agency, Deutsche Presse Agentur, reported that alliance members have informally agreed not to supply certain weaponry to Ukraine, fearing Russia could see the delivery of tanks and combat aircraft as the west entering the war and take retaliatory measures. Quite what this decision means in practical terms is disputed. There were also US-sourced reports that Israel had rejected a US request to allow Germany to send Spike anti-tank missiles to Ukraine. Spike missiles are produced in Germany with Israeli technology under an Israeli licence. Since the beginning of Russia’s large-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Israel has taken a neutral stance and refused to supply weapons to Ukraine. The disputes come as some influential US voices, from veteran diplomat Henry Kissinger to the New York Times, have urged Ukraine to realise it may have to lose territory to Putin. In a reference to the tensions, the UK foreign secretary Liz Truss, a staunch war hawk, warned the West against backsliding and appeasement, insisting the need to supply arms was urgent in a speech in Sarajevo: “What we cannot have is any lifting of sanctions, any appeasement, which will simply make Putin stronger in the longer term.” She insists private sanctions on Russia cannot be lifted until Putin has completely left Ukraine, and his army is irreversibly weakened. She has strong allies in eastern Europe, and the Baltics, but not in Paris or Berlin. Truss has argued that any backsliding would result in a more prolonged and painful conflict. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, adopted an ironic, almost uncomprehending tone at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week about the slowness of arms deliveries: “We are pursuing this with strategic patience. I don’t understand why this is so difficult.” The president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sensed German reticence stemmed from a desire to rebuild relations with Putin once the war ends. “No matter what the Russian state does, there is someone who says: ‘Let’s take his interests into account’,” said Zelenskiy. Poland has also heavily criticised Germany’s slowness, and within Germany the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has come under attack for appearing not to want either side to emerge victorious from the war, a stance Scholz denies. Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, chair of the Bundestag Defense Committee and a member of the Free Democrat party, said: “It must not be that at the end of the war the world sees Germany as a complete brakeman and loser just because we are unable to organise and communicate.” Early in the conflict Germany proposed quickly supplying Ukraine with heavy weaponry in a “ring system” – whereby eastern European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic would provide Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine, with these being replenished by modern German Leopard tanks. Whether the failure to achieve this yet is due to bureaucratic inertia, cynical procrastination or a reflection of the depleted state of the German armed forces is hard to unravel. If you are on the frontline, it probably matters little. In a speech in Davos, Scholz tried to dismiss claims that he did not understand the scale of the issues at stake. He said the 24 February invasion had come like a thunderclap. He described Putin’s war as “imperialism” that is “trying to bomb us back to a time when war was a common tool. It is not only the statehood of Ukraine at stake but a world order that binds might to law”. He claimed Putin had already missed all of his strategic goals. “A capture of all of Ukraine by Russia seems further away today than it was at the beginning of the war. More than ever, Ukraine is emphasising its European future.” He added that “our goal is clear. Putin must not win this war”. His remarks, insisting there can be no peace dictated by Putin, contrast with those of Boris Johnson, who has always insisted Putin must lose the war and be seen to lose the war. Truss was one of the first European figures to echo Ukrainian claims that it cannot lose territory in the war, but must regain land lost to Russian separatists since 2014. The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, in Kyiv this week said: “Only Ukraine has the right to decide about its future. No decisions can be taken about its future without it.” Although there are different voices within the Ukrainian diplomatic landscape, Zelenskiy’s public position appears to be broadly the same. He told a meeting at Davos that he joined by video link: “When Ukraine says it is fighting to regain its territories, it means that Ukraine will fight until it restores all of its territory. It doesn’t mean anything else. It’s about our sovereignty, our territorial integrity and our independence.” He added: “This state of ‘hot’ hostilities, of bloody war, can only move into diplomatic negotiations with the authentic participation of the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, supported by our strategic partners, when we see that the Russian Federation shows real willingness and desire to move from bloody war to diplomacy. This will be possible only when Russia concedes at least something, such as pulling back troops to the borders as they were on February 24.” At present there does not seem to be any likelihood of Russia signalling such a retreat. Quite the opposite. But that does not mean countries are not coming forward to offer their mediation services. Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, for instance, has assembled a complex four-point plan that was formally presented to the UN secretary general, António Guterres. The first step in the plan would involve a supervised ceasefire and “demilitarisation” of the frontline. This would be a multilateral negotiation at a conference on the future status of Ukraine, resuscitating the proposal of future Ukrainian neutrality backed by security guarantees provided by major powers. This could give a security umbrella to Ukraine before the end of the peace process, and act as a substitute for Ukraine’s one-time aspiration to Nato membership. The next stage would be a bilateral treaty between Ukraine and Russia on “border issues”. The language of the proposal points to free movement of people and economic life, de facto autonomy for the occupied territories and a single economic zone, as well as civil guarantees for Russian minorities, including over language. This would be very close to the Minsk agreement, a format that France and Germany oversaw and the Ukrainians never liked. The final stage would be a grand bargain on EU/Nato-Russia relations, revival of strategic stability talks, a new role for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and a revisiting of some of the other issues that were being discussed between the US and Russia last summer. Russia seemed to take great pleasure in ridiculing both the plan and its proponent. The former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev blasted Draghi’s proposals: “It seems that it was prepared not by diplomats, but by local political scientists who have read provincial newspapers and operate only with Ukrainian fakes.” Yet other voices in Russia think there are aspects of the plan that could be adopted later, when both sides have fought themselves to a standstill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Russians claim 959 combatants have surrendered in total at Azovstal since Monday, and that 80 of those who surrendered were wounded, of whom 51 have been taken to hospital. The numbers have not been independently verified. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, has told local media that a court will decide the fate of the Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at Azovstal. Russia claims 270 Ukrainian fighters were killed and “54 units of military equipment were disabled” overnight. It also claimed to have shot down two planes and 15 drones. The State Emergency Service of Ukraine said it neutralised 685 explosive devices on Ukrainian soil on Tuesday. The latest intelligence update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence highlights Russia’s “significant resourcing problems in Ukraine”, which it says “is likely contributing to a disunited command which continues to hamper Russia’s operations”. Vadim Shishimarin, 21, will appear at Kyiv’s Solomyansky district court from 2pm local time charged with war crimes and premeditated murder over the death of a 62-year-old man in north-east Ukraine on 28 February. The international criminal court on Tuesday sent a 42-member team to Ukraine to investigate alleged war crimes since the Russian invasion, in what it called the largest such deployment in its history. The US will create a new unit to research, document and publicise alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. The Conflict Observatory will “capture, analyse and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,” the US state department said. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said there was no movement in peace talks with Ukraine, and claimed Kyiv was showing a total unwillingness to continue them. The UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, has said the UK is open to the idea of an international criminal tribunal trying Vladimir Putin and other Russian leaders over the war. Austria’s foreign minister, Alexander Schallenberg, told the German broadcaster Deutschlandfunk that his country would stay militarily neutral. “The situation for us looks a little different,” he said when asked about Sweden and Finland applying to join Nato.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukrainian soldiers had finally ended their defence of the site in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, he said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Ukrainian combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one called for their execution. Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, Luhansk, as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. “They completely ruined Rubizhne, Vonokvakha, just as Mariupol,” he said in a video address late on Friday, adding the Russians were “trying to do the same with Severodonetsk and many other cities”. Twelve people were killed and another 40 wounded by Russian shelling in Severodonetsk, the regional governor said. Troops fired on a school in the eastern city, killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, said the head of the Luhansk regional state administration, Serhiy Haidai. At least seven people, including a child, have been injured in a Russian missile attack on the town of Lozova in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The missile had targeted “the newly renovated House of Culture” in Lozova, Zelenskiy said in a statement on social media. Zelenskiy proposed a formal deal with the country’s allies to secure Russian compensation for damage its forces have caused during the war. Zelenskiy, who says Russia is trying to destroy as much of Ukraine’s infrastructure as it can, said such a deal would show nations planning aggressive acts that they would have to pay for their actions. “We invite partner countries to sign a multilateral agreement and create a mechanism ensuring that everybody who suffered from Russian actions can receive compensation for all losses incurred,” he said in a video address on Friday. G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week. Moody’s on Friday cut Ukraine’s debt rating for the second time in three months and lowered the outlook to negative due to the growing risk the Russian invasion will affect the nation’s debt sustainability. The US Congress on Thursday approved a $40bn aid package for Ukraine to help fight Russia and keep the government operating, adding to aid packages and loans from the IMF and World Bank. Zelenskiy said his government needs $7bn a month to keep its economy afloat, while Moody’s estimates Ukraine faces financing needs of around $50bn this year. A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken of inside the plant, writing: “Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.” Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum, starting from Saturday. The Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Gasum said the taps would be turned off when its contract with Gazprom ended at 7am (0400 GMT). The move, which Russia has blamed on Finland’s refusal to pay in rubles, comes days after Finland and Sweden submitted a joint application for Nato membership. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he would speak to Finland tomorrow regarding its bid to join Nato and maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and that he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow. A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The US has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions on the Kremlin. Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukrainian soldiers have finally ended their defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, Prokopenko said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant.

Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, warned that Moscow is forming 12 new units in its western military district in response to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid. He also said that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers who were barricaded in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks have surrendered so far. The number of combatants who have surrendered has not been independently verified.

Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 79 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-79-of-the-invasion,2022-05-13T14:15:34Z,UK says failed Russian crossing of river shows pressure on troops; first war crimes trial begins in Kyiv,"The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said the failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river by Russian forces in the Donbas showed the pressure Russian commanders were under. Ukrainian military forces released footage on Thursday that they say shows destroyed Russian military vehicles and a pontoon bridge in eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian forces, the images were taken along the Siverskyi Donets River. The first war crimes trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck the Kremenchug oil refinery in central Ukraine, destroying its production capacity and fuel tanks. Ukraine says it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov said “the night was relatively calm” in the region. However he added that in Dergachi “the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building”, and that in Shebelinka “a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and five others were injured.” The Ukrainian counteroffensive around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv is “starting to look very similar to the counteroffensive that ultimately drove Russian troops away from Kyiv and out of western Ukraine entirely”, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Swedish membership of Nato would have a stabilising effect and would benefit countries around the Baltic sea, Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde said on Friday, a day after neighbour Finland announced it was in favour of applying to join the 30-nation alliance. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said that the European Union would provide another €500m (£425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil. British foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was vital to keep up the pressure on Russia by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and imposing further sanctions. “It is very important at this time that we keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and by increasing the sanctions.” The Republican senator Rand Paul has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill for Ukraine in the US Senate. Paul demanded changes including an inspector general to oversee how it is spent.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The two countries’ move abandons decades of military non-alignment triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and would redraw the security map of Europe. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance would look to provide both countries with interim security guarantees while the applications are processed, including possibly by increasing troops in the region. In apparent retaliation, the Kremlin has pulled the plug on electricity supplies to Finland, with which it shares a 1,300km (800 mile) border. Nato pledged open-ended military support for Ukraine on Sunday. At a meeting of alliance foreign ministers in Berlin, Germany’s Annalena Baerbock said it would provide military assistance “for as long as Ukraine needs this support for the self-defence of its country”. British intelligence revealed that Russia may have lost as much as a third of the invasion force, as more than 400 Russian soldiers were estimated to have been killed or wounded last week trying to cross the Donets river. UK defence chiefs said Russia’s offensive in the eastern Donbas region had “lost momentum” and that Moscow’s battle plan was “significantly behind schedule”. Ukraine’s president Volodymr Zelensky has warned that the military situation in Ukraine’s south-eastern Donbas region is “very difficult” as analysts say Russian president Vladimir Putin has his sights on annexing southern and eastern Ukraine in the months ahead. Russia’s defence ministry claimed it had carried out “high-precision” missile strikes on four artillery munitions depots in the Donetsk area in the east of Ukraine. The ministry also claimed airstrikes had destroyed two missile-launching systems and radar, and 15 Ukrainian drones around Donetsk and Lugansk. As Russian forces struggle in Ukraine, Ukrainian forces made inroads. The first Ukrainian battalion reached the Russian border in the Kharkhiv region today. Ukrainian authorities are conducting at least 10 active rape investigations involving Russian troops, and are calling for other victims to come forward. Kalush Orchestra, the band that won Eurovision last night for Ukraine, is auctioning off the statuette to raise funds for the Ukrainian army and Ukraine. The win has lifted spirits around Ukraine. Zelenskiy has warned that the war in his country risks triggering global food shortages and has urged international intervention to prevent global famine. Before the invasion, Ukraine supplied 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn and half of its sunflower oil. A cyberattack on the Lviv city council website resulted in stolen data that ended up published in Telegram channels linked to Russia. This happened the same weekend Italian police thwarted hacker attacks by pro-Russian groups on the Eurovision song contest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The ministry said “those in need of inpatient treatment [will] receive assistance in medical institutions” in Novoazovsk and Donetsk. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said in a statement: “The ICRC started on Tuesday 17 May to register combatants leaving the Azovstal plant, including the wounded, at the request of the parties. The registration process that the ICRC facilitated involves the individual filling out a form with personal details like name, date of birth and closest relative. This information allows the ICRC to track those who have been captured and help them keep in touch with their families.” Russia’s news agency Tass has quoted Denis Pushilin, the head of the Russian-controlled territory of Donetsk as saying that more than half of the Ukrainian fighters who were inside the Azovstal steelworks have now left the plant. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoyt, has posted details of a claimed attack on the village of Tyotkino. He said one person was killed and houses and factories were damaged. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has claimed that “Russians used aircraft to destroy civilian objects in the areas of the settlements of Loskutivka, Katerynivka and Orikhove” overnight. He also claimed that “16 enemy attacks were repulsed in Luhansk and Donetsk last night”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence has claimed that Russia’s Lt Gen Serhiy Kisel has been suspended for failing to capture Kharkiv, and V Adm Igor Osipov has been suspended from commanding the Black Sea fleet. The MoD’s intelligence briefing stated: “A culture of cover-ups and scapegoating is probably prevalent within the Russian military and security system. Many officials involved in the invasion of Ukraine will likely be increasingly distracted by efforts to avoid personal culpability for Russia’s operational setbacks.” The trial of 21-year-old Vadim Shishimarin has continued in Kyiv. He is a Russian tank commander charged with the murder of a 62-year-old civilian who was riding his bicycle on a village road. Shishimarin has pleaded guilty. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, has said in an interview with an Italian newspaper that she does not anticipate Nato opening a permanent base or placing nuclear weapons on Finnish soil. “This issue is not on the agenda,” she told Corriere della Sera. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, has said that his country will defend Sweden and Finland if they are attacked before they join Nato. The Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, has called for an urgent ceasefire in Ukraine so that serious negotiations can begin to end the war. Draghi said it was important to maintain pressure on Russia through economic sanctions “because we have to bring Moscow to the negotiating table”. G7 finance ministers will meet in Germany on Thursday hoping to thrash out a plan to bolster Ukraine’s war-ravaged economy. The US Treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, said before the meeting in Koenigswinter that what had been agreed so far was “not enough” and called on other countries to “join us in increasing their financial support”. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that food shortages stoked by the war in Ukraine could cause “malnutrition, mass hunger and famine, in a crisis that could last for years” around the world. Russia’s Aeroflot, Ural Airlines and Rossiya Airlines have been targeted with new sanctions to prevent them selling off landing slots at UK airports. The US embassy in Kyiv has reopened after closing nearly three months ago at the beginning of the war. Staff ran the star-spangled banner up the flagpole outside the embassy at a ceremony on Thursday morning.

Russian soldier pleads guilty in first Ukraine war crimes trial since invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/russian-soldier-pleads-guilty-first-ukraine-war-crimes-trial-since-invasion,2022-05-18T16:11:10Z,"Tank commander Vadim Shysimarin, 21, admits shooting dead a 62-year-old civilian who was on a bicycle","A Russian tank commander has pleaded guilty to shooting dead a 62-year-old man as he rode his bicycle down a village road, in Ukraine’s first trial for war crimes committed during the Russian invasion. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, sat emotionless as prosecutors detailed charges that he had fired his AK-47 at the unarmed cyclist from the window of a car in the north-eastern Sumy region in late February. Prosecutors have moved fast. It is extremely unusual to hold a trial while a conflict is still ongoing, and unprecedented to do it within weeks. The victim was shot dead less than three months ago, in the first days after the invasion. But Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority. National prosecutors are risking their own lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines. The case is being heard by three judges, who must reach an unanimous verdict for the suspect to be convicted and sentenced, even after the guilty plea. He faces life in jail for the killing. They will hear testimony from two witnesses. One is the victim’s wife, who was in the court to watch Shysimarin acknowledge murdering her husband, and another is the Russian soldier who was in the car with him at the time of the shooting and was later taken prisoner by Ukrainians. They will also be presented with evidence including the alleged murder weapon, in hearings expected to last two days. Shysimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on the day of the killing, 28 February, in Chupakhivka village. Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone just a few dozen metres from his own home. One of the men in the car told Shysimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window, and shot down the man. That instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order that might protect him from responsibility, prosecutor Andriy Syniu told journalists outside the courtroom. “The person who gave an ‘order’ isn’t his commander. He was aware of that. The person who gave the instruction was aware of that. Before they got into the vehicle they didn’t know each other,” Syniuk added. Ukrainian prosecutors have the support of several teams of international investigators and forensic experts, but face a mammoth task. Over a thousand bodies have been unearthed from mass graves in the town of Bucha alone, and dozens of rapes have been reported. Ukrainian prosecutor general Iryna Venediktova is preparing over 40 cases for war crimes trials, and authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes, including attacks on hospitals. Large swathes of Ukrainian territory are still under Russian control, and abuses have been widespread in all areas liberated from its forces to date, so the toll is expected to rise considerably if other areas fall back under Kyiv’s control. Human Rights Watch also said on Wednesday that it had documented further “apparent war crimes” by Russian troops around Kyiv and Chernihiv regions, including 22 apparent summary executions, nine other unlawful killings, six possible enforced disappearances and seven cases of torture. One of the few precedents for holding a trial while a war is still raging comes from the Balkans. A Bosnian Serb soldier, Borislav Herak, was captured by Bosnian army soldiers, put on trial for 35 killings and 14 rapes, and convicted of genocide and crimes against civilians. Senad Kreho, who was president of a district military tribunal in Sarajevo in 1993, said the legal system functioned fairly even though the war was still ongoing. “Numerous subsequent reviews of [Herak’s] case by international and national legal experts found that he was given a fair trial,” Kreho told the Associated Press. Two further unnamed soldiers are expected to have a first hearing in Ukraine within days, facing allegations they used a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher to shell homes and civilian buildings in Kharkiv district. Another case will be heard in absentia shortly. A soldier named as Mikhail Romanov is accused of rape and murder. Russia, which calls the invasion a “special military operation” denies its soldiers have committed war crimes.

Biden commerce secretary shifts blame for inflation on to Russia’s war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/05/biden-commerce-secretary-inflation-crisis,2022-06-05T18:35:03Z,Gina Raimondo’s comments seen as part of a White House push to deflect blame for nation’s economic troubles away from Biden,"Joe Biden’s commerce secretary Gina Raimondo attempted on Sunday to shift blame for the US inflation crisis back onto Russia’s war in Ukraine, days after another cabinet member admitted the presidential administration had made failures in predicting its impact on the economy. Janet Yellen, the treasury secretary, conceded last week she made an error in 2021 when she said inflation, which has only recently dropped from a near 40-year high, posed merely a “small risk”. “I think I was wrong then about the path that inflation would take,” Yellen told CNN last Tuesday. In her appearance on the same network’s State of the Union on Sunday, Raimondo pointed to “unexpected” developments that had derailed the global economy, and insisted: “We will get inflation under control.” She said: “I don’t think anyone predicted (Russian president Vladimir) Putin’s war in Ukraine, or various other things that have happened that have been unexpected. It’s worth noting that gas prices are up $1.40 a gallon since Putin moved troops into Ukraine.” Her comments will be seen as part of a concerted White House push to deflect blame for the nation’s economic troubles away from Biden, who has faced accusations of ignoring experts’ warnings over inflation and, more recently, the baby formula shortage. Calling inflation his “top domestic priority”, the president and his acolytes have embarked on a messaging campaign in recent weeks directed at voters in November’s midterm elections, and playing up his economic successes such as the bipartisan infrastructure act. It comes as gas prices reach almost record daily highs, up to $4.84 a gallon according to the AAA, the cost of groceries and services continue to soar, and new parents scramble to find baby formula. Raimondo herself appeared to torpedo the effort later in the interview by admitting she only learned of issues with formula in April, the same time as Biden. But production at the nation’s biggest manufacturing plant, owned by Abbott in Michigan, was closed down after bacteria was found during inspections as early as January, and problems were evident at the site late last year. “I’m not involved in the administration’s response here, but I think they’re doing a very good job and as soon as they learned that this could be a severe shortage they got on top of it,” she said. The Michigan facility resumed production this weekend after a lengthy shutdown, although it will likely be several weeks before formula appears on shelves. In another sign of growing disconnect in Democratic circles over the economy, California congressman Adam Schiff spoke out strongly on Sunday against Biden’s planned summer trip to Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s leading oil producing nations. “We should make every effort to lower oil prices, but going hat-in-hand to someone who’s murdered an American resident would not be on my list,” Schiff said on CBS’ Face the Nation, referring to the implication of Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the 2018 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. “I wouldn’t go,” Schiff continued. “I wouldn’t shake his hand. I would want to see Saudi Arabia lower oil prices, or increase their production [and] I’d want to see them make changes in their human rights record. I want to see them hold people accountable that were involved in that (Khashoggi) murder … before I would extend that kind of dignity.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed. Eight people died and 12 were wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. The regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched four missiles at about 5am local time on Tuesday. Two of the missiles hit buildings in the village, he said. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have stalled, according to both sides. The Ukrainian negotiator Mykhailo Podolyak said negotiations with Russia had been suspended, blaming Moscow’s “stereotypical mindset”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that virtually no peace talks were going on at the moment and blamed Ukraine for having “practically withdrawn” from the process. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, promised his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that French arms deliveries to Kyiv would intensify in the coming days, the Élysée said. Zelenskiy said he had had a “long and meaningful” conversation with Macron. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Russian forces may have sustained “impressive losses” since their invasion of Ukraine. He said: “If it is true that Russia has lost 15% of their troops since the beginning of the war, this is a world record of the losses of an army invading a country.” Borrell also said all EU member states would support Finland and Sweden in their applications to join Nato. Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to join Nato, a day after Sweden confirmed its intention to join the alliance. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, said he was sure both countries would overcome Turkish opposition to their membership bids. Niinistö and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, will meet Joe Biden on Thursday, the White House said. The leaders are expected to discuss Finland and Sweden’s Nato applications, European security and support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, it said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said Finland and Sweden joining Nato would probably make “not much difference”. The two Nordic countries “have been participating in Nato military exercises for many years”, Lavrov said.

First Russian soldier to go on trial in Ukraine for war crimes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/first-russian-soldier-to-go-on-trial-in-ukraine-for-war-crimes,2022-05-13T05:01:27Z,"As Nato expansion ratchets up the pressure on Vladimir Putin, Vadim Shysimarin, 21, is charged with murdering a 62-year-old civilian","A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, while the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. In a watershed moment, a Russian soldier will be accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian when he appears in the dock on Friday, with the case coming as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine’s general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv’s district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The case was this week filed at a criminal court. “He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,” said Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv on Tuesday. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. The trial is another propaganda triumph for Kyiv and another diplomatic move increasing pressure on Vladimir Putin with Finland’s plan to apply for Nato membership, and the expectation that Sweden will follow. Moscow called Finland’s announcement hostile and threatened retaliation, including unspecified “military-technical” measures. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the Finns would be “warmly welcomed” and promised a “smooth and swift” accession process. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said: “We would support a Nato application by Finland and-or Sweden should they apply.” Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss has urged a meeting of G7 foreign ministers to equip Ukraine to Nato standards and maintain sanctions against Russia until it has fully withdrawn. The BBC reported that Truss told the meeting in Germany: “[Vladimir] Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression. “The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment.” Elsewhere, Ukraine has claimed that it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea, as the Kremlin bristled at Finland seeking to join Nato and Sweden moving to follow suit. “Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire – it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,” said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Maxar images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine’s north and east. Ukrainian forces are reported to have driven Russian troops out of the region around the second-largest city, Kharkiv. The Reuters news agency said its journalists had confirmed Ukraine was in control of territory stretching to the banks of the Siverskiy Donets river, around 40km (25 miles) east of Kharkiv. Regional authorities reported ongoing missile strikes around Poltava and shelling at Dergach, near Kharkiv, that killed two people. Russia’s army said it struck Donetsk and Kharkiv on Thursday, killing more than 170 people and destroying Ukrainian drones and rockets. Fighting has continued in Ukraine’s south and east. Ukraine’s presidency said shelling continued throughout Lugansk – part of the Donbas region where Ukrainian forces are fighting Russian armour and Kremlin-backed separatists. Zelensky said in his Thursday address to the nation that Russian forces had destroyed 570 health care facilities in the country, including 101 hospitals. “What for? It’s nonsense. It’s barbarity.” In the north-eastern region of Chernihiv, three people were killed and 12 others wounded on Thursday in a strike on a school in Novgorod-Siversky, the emergency services said. Iryna Vereshchuk, a Ukrainian deputy prime minister, said “difficult talks” were under way over the evacuation of 38 seriously wounded troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. “We have started a new round of negotiations around a road map for an [evacuation] operation. And we will start with those who are badly wounded,” she told 1+1 television. Disputes have intensified over Russian supplies of energy to Europe – still Moscow’s biggest source of funds and Europe’s biggest source of heat and power. Moscow said it would halt gas flows to Germany through the main pipeline over Poland, while Kyiv said it would not reopen a pipeline route it shut this week unless it regains control of areas from pro-Russian fighters. Prices for gas in Europe surged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting the country’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Dmitry Peskov said Finnish entry to Nato is “definitely” a threat to Russia. The Kremlin spokesperson said everybody wants to avoid a direct clash between Russia and Nato, and that Nato expansion will not make the world or Europe more stable. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has said he has spoken today to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Zelenskiy supported Finland’s steps towards Nato membership. Other European Nato leaders from Estonia, Denmark and Romania have also voiced support. The UN human rights chief has said 1,000 bodies had been recovered in the area of the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in recent weeks, adding that many of the violations it was verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes. Russian news agencies have reported that Russian forces hit two ammunition depots in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine overnight. The defence ministry also said Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian S-300 air defence missile system in the Kharkiv region and a radar station near the city of Odesa. Firing from Ukraine has killed one person and wounded seven in the Russian border village of Solokhi in the province of Belgorod, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has said. Overnight the Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other equipment in the village of Bilohorivka, that had been struck when the Russians were attempting to construct a pontoon-bridge over the Siverskyi Donets River. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. The withdrawal of Russian forces from Kharkiv is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,” the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has said after talks with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, reiterated that a normalisation of relations with Vladimir Putin seemed impossible, accusing the Russian president of having “grossly violated human rights” and international law, saying “he’s guilty of absolutely barbaric onslaught on a totally innocent country”.

"Do not use Ukraine war to defer climate goals, warns Mark Carney",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/11/do-not-use-ukraine-war-to-defer-climate-goals-warns-mark-carney-energy-crisis,2022-05-11T17:17:11Z,UN climate envoy says world cannot afford to derail progress because of energy crisis linked to invasion,"The UN climate envoy Mark Carney has warned against deferring emissions reduction targets in reaction to the energy crisis linked to the war in Ukraine, saying it will only require more “radical” action in the future. The former Bank of England governor said he recognised the impact sanctions on Russia were having on global energy supplies and the cost of living, but added that governments could not afford to derail climate progress that could help achieve the 1.5C limit on global heating. “European energy markets have ruptured, with negative spill overs around the globe,” Carney said in a speech at the Net Zero Delivery Summit in London. “Households in developed economies are facing crippling energy bills, and across the developing world, the grind of energy poverty is worsening. And all the while, the climate crisis grows, building future costs that will dwarf current hardships,” he added. Carney said efforts to find alternatives to Russian oil were resulting in higher emissions in the near-term, “and leading some … to argue to temporarily set aside our climate goals”. “But we know the climate doesn’t care why emissions happen, only how much occur. The more we emit now, the more radical action will be needed later. We need to speed up, not slow down,” he said. Carney stopped short of naming groups that may put climate targets under threat. However, his comments came after Conservative MPs and peers in the Net Zero Scrutiny Group tried to link the government’s climate agenda to the cost of living crisis and called for cuts to green taxes and an increase in fossil fuel production. But any attempt to delay net zero targets – at least in the UK – would mean breaching or repealing the 2008 Climate Change Act. Under the act, British governments must set five-year carbon budgets that stretch beyond the term of the current parliament. The UK’s carbon budget, its sixth, runs to 2035. Some companies have warned about their own ability to meet self-imposed climate targets in light of the Ukraine war. In March, Barclays said the effects of the invasion could impact its efforts to slash emissions, as it strives to achieve net zero by 2050. Nearly 20% of shareholders subsequently rejected its climate strategy after an annual general meeting that was disrupted by activists protesting against its financing of fossil fuels. But Carney said that, contrary to calls for a delay to climate targets, the Russian invasion should spark further investments in green energy. “Russia’s war underscored that a resilient system needs more diversified and reliable suppliers – the price of greater security of supply in the near terms will be more stranded assets over the medium term,” he said. “Once built, clean energy systems are more affordable, efficient, resilient and reliable. No one owns the wind or the sun and hydrogen is literally everywhere.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The historic decision was triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sweden is expected to follow suit. Finland’s president Sauli Niinistö said he is ready to meet Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to discuss Nato membership concerns. Russia’s offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region “has lost momentum and fallen significantly behind schedule”, and is “unlikely to dramatically accelerate its rate of advance over the next 30 days,” according to British military intelligence. A missile strike hit some military infrastructure in the western Ukrainian region of Lviv early on Sunday, the region’s Governor Maxim Kozitsky said. Nato’s secretary general Jens Stoltenberg said he is confident common ground can be reached to allay Turkey’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s membership into the alliance. Russia’s offensive in Ukraine is failing and its operation in the Donbas region has stalled, Nato’s secretary general said. Russia said it had attacked Ukrainian positions in the east with missiles, targeting command centres and arsenals. Although this could not be independently verified. Russia’s blockade of the Black Sea is pushing entire populations toward famine, the G7 foreign ministers have said. Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra has released a powerful video for their Eurovision-winning song which was filmed in the ruins of Irpin and Bucha. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he met with US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and that “more weapons and other aid is on the way to Ukraine.” Ukrainian officials claim that Russia is planning to hold a referendum in Mariupol over whether the city will join Russia. Nato’s deputy general secretary, Mircea Geoana, congratulated Ukraine on their Eurovision triumph and said the win sends a message to Vladimir Putin Italian police thwarted hacker attacks by pro-Russian groups during the 10 May semi-final and Saturday final of the Eurovision song contest in Turin, authorities said. Nato must maintain its “open door” policy towards admitting new members, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has said. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Germany has prepared everything for a quick ratification process regarding Finland and Sweden joining Nato. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats are poised to come out in favour of the country joining Nato, paving the way for an application.

The liberation of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske could signal a new phase in the war, Zelenskiy said, while cautioning against expecting “certain victories”. Belarus has said it will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles and warned Belarus could “inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy”. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381 as well as 3,680 injured. At least 100 civilians remained in the Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor said. Ukraine’s Azov Regiment made a plea to the international community for help, saying its soldiers were trapped in “completely unsanitary conditions, with open wounds” and without necessary medication or food. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday as they consider whether to apply for Nato membership. Downing Street said they would discuss “broader security issues”. Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a five-storey building that was destroyed in March in Izium, about 120km (75 miles) from Kharkiv. US lawmakers in the House of Representatives have approved more than $40bn more aid for Ukraine. The legislation was due to go the US Senate with hopes high for its passage. Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the US director of national intelligence has said. Avril Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. The UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the top human rights body. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via Sokhranivka from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reported. Russia’s Gazprom said this would be “technologically impossible”. Four Russian regional governors reportedly resigned on Tuesday as the country braces for the impact of economic sanctions. The heads of the Tomsk, Saratov, Kirov and Mari El regions announced their immediate departure from office, while the head of Ryazan region said he would not run for another term. Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision song contest.

Ukrainians have also repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. British defence intelligence said Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – a formation with about 800 personnel at full strength – from the failed effort to cross the Siversky Donets River, 12 miles (20km) west of Severodonetsk. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. That news came as US president Joe Biden expressed his support for the right of Finland and Sweden “to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements” in a call with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining Nato. The comments appeared directed at the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation. Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy says “very difficult negotiations are underway” on the evacuation of the seriously wounded and medics from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which Russian forces continue to bombard. “Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders,” the president added. A Russian soldier has appeared in court accused of murdering an unarmed man on a bicycle, at the start of the first war crime trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. Vadim Shysimarin, a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is charged with the premeditated murder of a 62-year-old man. The case is scheduled to resume on Wednesday. Georgia’s breakaway region of South Ossetia will hold a referendum on joining Russia on 17 July, the region’s leader, Anatoly Bibilov, has announced. South Ossetia was at the centre of the Russian-Georgian war in 2008 after which the Kremlin recognised the territory – along with another separatist region, Abkhazia – as an independent state and stationed military bases there. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Kyiv hopes to arm a million people as the country prepares for a “new, long phase of war”. He warned that “extremely tough weeks are ahead” and that Ukraine needed “unity, cohesion, will and patience” during this difficult period. The UK has issued sanctions against a dozen members of Vladimir Putin’s family and inner circle including his long-rumoured girlfriend. The Foreign Office argued that the Russian president officially owns only modest assets, and has sanctioned the people who help support his lavish lifestyle. Britain and Norway have signed a new joint declaration on enhancing cooperation between the two countries. Boris Johnson met his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Gahr Støre, in London on Friday, where both leaders “underscored their full support for any sovereign choice made by Nordic partners to enhance their security”, a Downing Street statement said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for the first time since before the invasion began, the Pentagon said. Austin “urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication”, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said. The EU could agree on a phased embargo on Russian oil next week, despite concerns about supply in eastern Europe, according to diplomats and officials. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters an agreement could come as early as Monday when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. A third diplomat said there was a chance of an agreement later in the week. The lawyer for the US professional basketball player Brittney Griner said her pre-trial detention has been extended by one month.

Putin ties Ukraine invasion to second world war in Victory Day speech,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/putin-ties-ukraine-invasion-second-world-war-victory-day-speech-russia,2022-05-09T11:03:22Z,"Soldiers ‘fighting for same thing their fathers and grandfathers did’, says president as he seeks to justify war","Vladimir Putin has told Russian soldiers they are “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did” as he used his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. As Putin sought to rally his country through the memory of the second world war, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, pushed back in his own address from Kyiv. “We will not allow anyone to annex this victory, we will not allow it to be appropriated,” he said. The dual speeches marked a closely watched anniversary in eastern Europe, where Russia has used claims that it is fighting fascism to justify its bombardment of cities such as Mariupol and Kyiv and to launch the largest military campaign in Ukraine since the 1940s. Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. Instead he suggested Russia was “forced” into the war by Nato and pledged to provide aid for the families of soldiers who had died in what the Kremlin is calling a “special operation”. Speaking at the 77th annual celebration of the defeat of Nazi Germany, the Russian president launched a defence of his war in Ukraine, pivoting from a recognition of Russia’s “greatest generation” to a description of how it was believed Ukraine was being armed by the west for an imminent attack on Crimea, the peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. “Nato countries did not want to listen to us,” Putin said. “They had different plans, and we saw it. They were planning an invasion into our historic lands, including Crimea … Russia gave a preemptive rebuff to aggression, it was a forced, timely and only right decision.” He also described the war as “sacred”. “The defence of the motherland, when its fate was being decided, has always been sacred,” Putin said, speaking of the second world war. “And now, you are fighting for our people in the Donbas. For the security of our homeland – Russia.” Russia provided fewer armoured vehicles than in past years during the Red Square parade on Monday and a planned flyover was cancelled, ostensibly due to weather conditions. Putin did not bring up specific Russian victories in his speech, despite speculation his forces were engaged in a last-ditch effort to secure Mariupol and its Azovstal plant from the remaining Ukrainian defenders by 9 May. Instead, the Russian president addressed troop losses in the war, saying he had signed a new order that would give educational aid to the children of those killed. The Kremlin has been accused of seeking to cover up losses. After the sinking of the Moskva cruiser in the Black Sea, a number of families went public with claims the Russian military was trying to avoid confirming deaths onboard the ship. “The death of each of our soldiers and officers is a grief for all of us and an irreparable loss for relatives and friends,” Putin said. “The state, regions, enterprises, public organisations will do everything to take care of such families and help them. We will provide special support to the children of the dead and wounded comrades. The presidential decree on this was signed today.” The muted speech came in stark contrast to that delivered by Zelenskiy, who delivered a recorded address to a piano accompaniment as he walked through central Kyiv past anti-tank barricades. “This is not a war of two armies,” he said. “This is a war of two world views. A war waged by barbarians … who believe that their missiles can destroy our philosophy.” In the speech, Zelenskiy took aim at Russian claims Ukraine had sought to block 9 May celebrations, a focus of Russian state media in advance of the holiday. “Our enemy dreamed that we would refuse to celebrate 9 May and the victory over Nazism,” said Zelenskiy. “So that the word ‘denazification’ will have a chance [to succeed] … On the day of victory over Nazism we are fighting for a new victory. The road to it is difficult but we have no doubt that we will win. “And very soon there will be two Victory Days in Ukraine. And some will not even have one left.” On the ground, meanwhile, intense fighting raged in Ukraine’s east, the vital Black Sea port of Odesa in the south came under bombardment again, and Russian forces sought to finish off the Ukrainian defenders making their last stand at a steel plant in Mariupol. More than 60 people were feared dead over the weekend after Russian bombardment flattened a Ukrainian school being used as a shelter in Bilohorivka, an eastern village, Ukrainian officials said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine prosecutors ready to launch first war crimes trials of Russia conflict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/ukraine-prosecutors-ready-launch-first-war-crimes-russia-conflict,2022-05-11T13:31:32Z,Exclusive: Russian soldier who allegedly killed man before raping his wife to be among first to face trial,"Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody, is expected to be the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. He was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened close to the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74. The case has this week been filed at a criminal court. “He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,” said Venediktova, speaking from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv. A spokesperson added: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Separately, on 24 February, the day Vladimir Putin’s “special military operation”was launched, it is alleged two Russian soldiers using a Soviet truck-mounted 122mm multiple rocket launcher carried out artillery shelling of homes and civilian buildings in the village of Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv district. They also allegedly hit an “educational institution” in the city of Dergachiv, from Belgorod in Russia. The soldiers later crossed over the border of Ukraine and continued shelling targets in the Kharkiv region, it is claimed, but they were taken prisoner by Ukrainian forces and now await trial. Their case file, laying out charges of breaking the laws and customs of war, has also been filed at a criminal procedural court in Ukraine, but names and photographs are yet to be issued. In a final case that is probably heading to a trial in absentia, a soldier named as Mikhail Romanov, who has a large tattoo of a bear on his chest, is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. A second soldier also raped the 33-year-old woman, who has a four-year-old son. The case is yet to be filed at court but the prosecutor’s office was able to provide a photograph from social media that has been used by the victim to identify the man who allegedly attacked her. Romanov’s apparent partner was contacted for comment by this newspaper but she did not respond to questions. Of Romanov, Venediktova said: “Now we don’t know where he is – maybe he is fighting still, maybe he is on rotation in the Russian federation, maybe he is dead. We don’t know but we want to prosecute him in absentia.” She added: “We want to demonstrate to these criminals that we will find them. And we will prevent the deaths of other people in other territories.” Venediktova, who on Monday travelled to the border with Poland to meet the UK attorney general, Suella Braverman, who has provided her with a former international criminal court judge as an adviser, said 36 identified war crimes suspects were currently being prosecuted, with various levels of progress. Venediktova, whose office desk has a dozen hotlines, including one to Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said she feared many more crimes would emerge from the territories in the east and south of Ukraine currently occupied by Russia, including the devastated port city of Mariupol. Venediktova, who keeps a Russian cluster bomb casing that was found in Kherson, a city in south Ukraine, on her desk, said countless atrocities were being committed. She said: “I have a theory that the Russian federation decided that when they come to Ukraine everyone will be happy to see them but when they understood that the whole population was fighting against them, against a common enemy, they decided to do everything to scare the population.” At the end of March videos emerged of alleged war crimes committed by Ukrainian soldiers against Russian prisoners of war, including a film that appeared to show three soldiers being shot in the legs. Venediktova said her office was continuing to investigate those claims and others. She said: “We shall not act as barbarians but as people who understand the rule of law. We are still investigating but as I understand some of the facts could be fake. [But] there is not only one case where we started investigations, we have several.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 76 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-76-of-the-invasion,2022-05-10T17:08:16Z,US warns Putin will use ‘more drastic means’ to achieve Ukraine objectives; Odesa under repeated missile attack,"Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, said Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine. Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. At least 100 civilians remain in the Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Ukrainian officials have said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building that was destroyed weeks ago in the north-east of the country. The bodies were found in a five-storey building that collapsed in March in Izium. Russia’s underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its “best-case scenario” planning have led to “demonstrable operational failings, preventing the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, from announcing significant military success in Ukraine” at the 9 May Victory Day parade, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, visited areas around Kyiv devastated by the war on a surprise visit. In a press conference, Baerbock said Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union at some point but that there could be no shortcut to membership. France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. Clément Beaune, an ally of Macron and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, spoke in a call on Tuesday. The two heads of state “reiterated their commitment to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” the Élysée said. Chinese state media said Xi warned Macron that confrontation between blocs resulting from the Ukraine crisis could become a bigger and more lasting threat to global peace than the crisis itself. Russia has been blamed for a massive cyber-attack against a satellite internet network an hour before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The digital attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT network in late February took thousands of modems offline and helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of the country, the Council of the EU said. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prior to the speech, foreign officials had said Putin could use it to launch a full mobilisation of Russian troops or formally declare war in Ukraine, but there were no large policy announcements. In a rare mention of Russian casualties in Ukraine, Putin said that the “the death of each of our soldiers and officers is a grief for all of us and an irreparable loss for relatives and friends”, adding that he signed a law that “will provide special support to the children of the dead and wounded comrades”. Commemorating victory over Nazi Germany, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said Ukraine would win in its war with Russia and not cede any territory. In a video posted to social media, the Ukrainian president said: “We are fighting for our children’s freedom and therefore we will win. Very soon there will be two victory days in Ukraine. And someone won’t have any. We won then. We will win now.” Residents of Russian-occupied areas of Zaporizhzhia oblast have had their personal documents taken away by Russian authorities, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces has said, saying they would be returned “on the basis of the participation of the latter in the solemn events … of Victory Day”. Kirill Stremousov, deputy chairman of the pro-Russian military-civilian administration in Kherson in southern Ukraine has said: “We will integrate as much as possible into the Russian Federation”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has revealed shortcomings in its ability to conduct precision strikes at scale, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update The European Union should consider seizing frozen Russian foreign exchange reserves to help pay for the cost of rebuilding Ukraine after the war, its foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, has said in an interview. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is expected to travel to Berlin for talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday and to make a major address. It will be his first trip abroad since his re-election and Ukraine is expected to be high on the agenda for the two leaders. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace has accused leaders of Russia’s armed forces of “amorality and corruption” and said the conflict in Ukraine brings “dishonour”. The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Traumatised Ukrainian refugees who have sought sanctuary in the UK may have to wait two years before they can get specialised therapy to help them heal from the horrors of war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 74 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-74-of-the-invasion,2022-05-08T09:29:50Z,Dozens feared dead after Russian bombs hit school in Bilohorivka; Ukraine says it has destroyed another Russian ship,"Dozens of people are feared dead after Russian bombs hit a school in the eastern Ukraine village of Bilohorivka where 90 people were sheltering, according to the governor of Luhansk. He said at least two bodies had been pulled from the rubble and 60 more are feared dead. Russian forces fired six cruise missiles at the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa on Saturday and continued to bombarded a besieged steel mill in Mariupol. Russia appears to want to complete their conquest of Mariupol in time for Victory Day celebrations on 9 May. The Ukrainian government has said that it has destroyed another Russian ship. The ministry of defence claimed that Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 had hit the landing craft of the Serna project, tweeting: “The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on May 9 this year will be held near Snake Island – at the bottom of the sea.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than 300 civilians have been rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where they had been stuck for 72 days during a bitter battle for the city. Zelenskiy said they were now preparing for a “second stage of evacuation” to rescue doctors and soldiers still trapped there. The Ukrainian government have urged Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to help with the evacuation. Zelenskiy also expressed regret at the cultural devastation caused by the war. In his nightly address on Telegram, he said “nearly 200 cultural heritage sites” in Ukraine had been lost or damaged. CIA Director William Burns said the war is in a dangerous phase because President Putin “thinks he cannot afford to lose”. Burns said the huge amount of western military support for Ukraine was not a deterrent to the Russian President. Britain has pledged to provide another £1.3bn ($1.60bn) in military support and aid to Ukraine. The new funds will almost double Britain’s previous spending commitments to Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement, “Putin’s brutal attack is not only causing untold devastation in Ukraine – it is also threatening peace and security across Europe.” The Group of Seven (G7) leaders will hold a video call on Sunday with Zelenskiy in a show of unity the day before Russia marks its Victory Day holiday, the White House said. Talks will focus on the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, efforts to bolster the country and ways to demonstrate “continued G7 unity in our collective response, including by imposing severe costs for Putin’s war”, a spokesperson for the White House said. The conflict in Ukraine is taking a “heavy toll” on some of Russia’s most capable units, the UK’s ministry of defence said in its latest intelligence report. At least one T-90M, Russia’s most advanced tank, had been destroyed in fighting, the ministry added. “It will take considerable time and expense for Russia to reconstitute its armed forces following this conflict,” the report said. The UN security council has issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words “war”, “conflict” or “invasion”. The statement instead “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and voiced “strong support” for the secretary general, António Guterres, in seeking a peaceful solution to the “dispute”. The World Health Organization indicated it is gathering evidence for potential war crimes committed by Russia. The WHO emergencies director, Mike Ryan, said the agency has already documented 200 attacks on hospitals and clinics in Ukraine which could violate international law. Nearly 4 million Russians left the country in the first three months of this year, official statistics published by Russia’s federal security service show. Arrivals to former Soviet countries saw a significant spike after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February. It is unclear how many have since returned to their home country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘China in mind’: Japan mulls beefing up military as Ukraine war rings alarm,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/japan-china-defence-ukraine-war-russia,2022-05-30T00:00:13Z,Country could double spending and acquire ‘first-strike’ capability in shift away from defensive postwar posture,"Weeks after he became Japan’s prime minister last year, Fumio Kishida pulled on a dark green bomber jacket, the hinomaru flag emblazoned on his sleeve, and climbed into a tank. Official photos show him displaying an awkward smile for his audience at Camp Asaka – the men and women of the the country’s Self-Defence Forces – an indication, perhaps, that postwar Japanese leaders and military hardware have not always been easy bedfellows. The image belied Kishida’s political grounding in a dovish wing of his Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and his background as an MP representing a constituency in Hiroshima who eschewed the more aggressive language on security of others in his party. Yet it is under Kishida, and not his hawkish predecessor, Shinzo Abe, that Japan is undergoing a dramatic shift in its strictly defensive postwar posture in which the country could double spending on its military and edge closer to acquiring a “first-strike” capability. Eight months into his term of office, Kishida faces unprecedented foreign policy challenges. Russia’s war in Ukraine has set alarm bells ringing in the Asia Pacific region about the potential for a copycat Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy that Beijing regards as a renegade province that will one day be reunited with the motherland. Article nine of Japan’s constitution, authored by US occupation forces after the second world war, renounces war and forbids the country from using force to settle international disputes. Its military is limited to a strictly defensive role. Any attempt to acquire the ability to strike enemy bases before Japan itself is attacked would be a clear violation of the constitution, said Akira Kawasaki, a member of the executive committee of Peace Boat, a Japanese NGO. Even before the first shot was fired in Ukraine, the LDP had been shifting towards a more robust defence policy, culminating last month in a party commission proposal to increase spending on the military from 1% to 2% or more of GDP over the next five years. Japan, Kawasaki points out, has the third largest GDP in the world. “If Japan spends 2% of its GDP on the military, it would become the world’s third-largest military power. This would be a great threat to the entire world, and totally incompatible with the peace-loving nation the people of Japan have sought to become under the postwar constitution.” Japan is the world’s ninth biggest spender on defence, but the $54.1bn (£42.8bn) it spent in 2021 is dwarfed by the US’s $801bn, and China, in second place with an estimated $293bn, an increase of 4.7% from 2020. Ditching its unofficial postwar commitment to keeping defence spending at about 1% of GDP is a reflection of growing anxiety over the regional security environment and Russia’s war in Ukraine, according to Michito Tsuruoka, an associate professor of policy management at Keio University in Tokyo. “More people in Japan, including Kishida, argue that the Russian invasion should not be a precedent to be repeated in Asia by China. We have China in mind when we think about the war in Ukraine,” Tsuruoka said. “Whether Japanese politicians or the public want it or not, Tokyo will have to shoulder more security responsibility in the region, given the rise of China, North Korea’s missile and nuclear programmes and the relative decline of US primacy in the region.” Supporters of a more robust posture point out that the LDP proposals do nothing more than mirror defence spending targets among Nato members, and take account of growing US demands for its allies in the region to shoulder a bigger share of the security burden. Kishida has said it is time to ditch the doves-versus-hawks language of the postwar era and recognise the present-day realities of a nuclear-armed North Korea and a China that has stepped up military activity in the South and East China seas. “We are seriously concerned about the rapid growth of Chinese military activities,” Kishida said in an interview with Nikkei Asia this week. “I want to have calm and realistic discussions about what we need to protect the public.” Concern is rising in Japan over Chinese air and maritime activity near the Senkakus, a chain of uninhabited islets in the East China Sea that are administered by Japan but claimed by China, where they are known as the Diaoyu. “Japan’s defence capabilities need to be fundamentally improved in light of the current changes in the international situation,” Kishida told Nikkei Asia. He said he was determined to “radically strengthen our defence capacity” in a revised national security strategy to be published by the end of the year. That could include dismantling another postwar taboo, the acquisition of an ability to “counterattack” an enemy base where preparations have begun to launch an attack on Japan. “If Japan decides to undertake ground strike operations against North Korea or China, it might deviate from traditional interpretation of its constitution, in the short run at least,” said Narushige Michishita, the vice-president of the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo. Although Japan has already deployed missile-defence systems, it risks falling behind its rivals in what some analysts are describing as a new north-east Asian arms race. “The problem is that North Korea and China are developing advanced weapon systems that could penetrate Japan’s missile-defence shields,” Michishita said. “So it actually makes sense for Japan to start making the necessary preparations today.” Neither proposal will get far without the support of the public and the LDP’s junior coalition partner Komeito, a Buddhist-linked party with a pacifist tradition that insisted on altering the wording from “first strike” to “counterstrike” to make it more palatable to the public. A recent opinion poll by the Asahi Shimbun and Tokyo University reflects unease in Japan following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The survey found that a record 64% were in favour of bolstering Japan’s defences and only 10% against. A Yomiuri Shimbun survey, however, found respondents were split down the middle at 46% each on the merits of acquiring the ability to strike enemy bases. Some government officials say acquiring a counterstrike capability is permitted under a 1956 interpretation of the constitution that cites Japan’s right to self-defence, but opponents say the proposed changes would put the country in peril. “No matter what the LDP calls it, such an offensive posture would risk a preemptive attack either by design or by accident,” Kawasaki said. “Countries surrounding Japan would also react in the same way. This move would promote an arms race and increase the likelihood of an attack on Japan.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 73 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-73-of-the-invasion,2022-05-07T02:05:19Z,"Zelenskiy says Mariupol being ‘tortured to death’, as UN security council omits words ‘war’ and ‘invasion’ from its first statement","The UN Security Council issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words “war”, “conflict” or “invasion”. The statement instead “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and voiced “strong support” for Secretary General Antonio Guterres in seeking a peaceful solution to the “dispute”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the besieged southern port city of Mariupol is “an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war”. He also confirmed in his latest national address, evacuation operations are continuing in Mariupol with 40 civilians rescued. Three evacuation buses left the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol , according to Russian media reports. Buses carrying 25 civilians including children were brought out from the plant to a camp in the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remained trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. On peace talks, Zelenskiy said he was “elected as president of Ukraine and not a mini-Ukraine”, and that Russia must first fall back to the territory it held before its invasion on 23 February if talks are to succeed. He also accused Russia of “outright nuclear blackmail” during the speech at Chatham, the international affairs think tank, saying “Russia is blackmailing Europe through threats”. The latest US military aid package to Ukraine, announced by president Joe Biden, is worth $150m, secretary of state Antony Blinken confirmed. It includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment, field equipment and spare parts. It brings Washington’s military assistance to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began to around $3.8bn, Blinken said. US defense department spokesperson John Kirby deflected questions about whether the Pentagon provided information to Ukraine that helped military leaders target Russian generals. Kirby would not corroborate the reports, instead saying Ukraine “makes the decisions” when it comes to how they use US intel and stressed that Ukraine combines intelligence from many countries and the US is “not the sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians”. Germany will also send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). Vladimir Putin will send a “doomsday” warning to the west when he leads Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on Monday. A fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral will include the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, Russia’s defence ministry said. A yacht reportedly belonging to Putin was seized by Italian officials. Reporters say the yacht, which had been moored in a Tuscany marina, belongs to Putin. The ministry of economy and finance said in a statement the boat was seized under regulations relating to “actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Britain’s ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, adding that it strongly protested in relation to new UK sanctions on Russian media. Russia would continue to react “harshly and decisively” to all sanctions imposed by the UK, the ministry said in a statement. Amnesty International said there was compelling evidence that Russian troops had committed war crimes in the Kyiv area in February and March. Civilians also suffered abuses such as “reckless shootings and torture” at the hands of Russian forces when they occupied an area outside Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha, in the early stages of the invasion, the rights group said in a report. Russian troops are attempting to encircle and storm Severodonetsk, the easternmost city in Ukraine held by Kyiv, a local official said. Severodonetsk’s capture would be a major gain for the Russian army which has refocused its efforts on taking the whole of the eastern Donbas region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: what we know on day 72 of the invasion,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-what-we-know-on-day-72-of-the-invasion,2022-05-06T00:36:10Z,"Russia violated its promise of Mariupol ceasefire, Kyiv says, as US says it shared intel on the location of Moskva cruiser sunk by Ukraine","A third United Nations operation is under way to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. “A convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell ... and take them back to safety,” the UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has described the war zone in Mariupol as appearing to be “hellscapes”. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steel plant area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. A Ukrainian commander said “heavy, bloody fighting” continues at Azovstal and Russia violated its promise of a ceasefire, preventing the evacuation of civilians. Svyatoslav Palamar, a commander of the Azov regiment that is defending the site, said in a video on Telegram: “Russians violated the promise of a truce and did not allow the evacuation of civilians who continue to hide from shelling in the basement of the plant.” Palamar earlier pleaded for help for the “wounded soldiers dying in terrible agony” and the evacuation of civilians trapped in the plant. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, demanded that Ukraine order its fighters holed up in Azovstal to surrender, the Kremlin said. In a call with Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, Putin claimed Russia was still ready to provide safe passage for civilians from the plant, according to the Kremlin. Ukraine is “unlikely” to launch a counter-offensive before mid-June, when it hopes to have received more weapons from its allies, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Oleksiy Arestovych added that he did not expect Russia’s offensive in Ukraine to produce any “significant results” by 9 May, when Russia celebrates its Victory Day over Nazi Germany. The US says it shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva prior to the strike that sank the warship, but the decision to attack was taken by the Ukrainians. US officials also reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals. Zelenskiy has reportedly invited the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to visit him in Kyiv. Zelenskiy made the invitation during a telephone call with Steinmeier in which “past irritations were cleared up”, weeks after the president was snubbed by Ukraine, a source from the German president’s office said. Zelenskiy confirmed he had spoken with Steinmeier today. The UK government has placed sanctions on Evraz, the multinational steelmaker part-owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich. The company was formerly counted among Britain’s biggest companies. The Foreign Office said on Thursday that the action would “further chip away at Putin’s financial reserves and siege economy, and support Ukraine’s continued resistance”. The European Union plans to impose sanctions on Alina Kabaeva, long rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church. Two sources said the EU has proposed sanctions on Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast whose appearance on a draft sanctions list was first reported by Bloomberg. Naftali Bennett said Vladimir Putin had apologised for the Russian foreign minister’s claims that Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins. The Israeli prime minister, after a call with Putin, said he had accepted the apology and thanked the president for clarifying his position. Putin hopes to claim Mariupol as key prop in Victory Day celebrations, according to Ukrainian intelligence. “Mariupol, according to [Russia’s] plans, should become the centre of celebrations,” Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said. “For this purpose, the city is urgently cleaning the central streets from rubble, bodies of dead and unexploded Russian ammunition. A large-scale propaganda campaign continues, during which Russians will be shown stories about the ‘joy’ of local residents from meeting with the invaders.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine war has stoked global food crisis that could last years, says UN",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/ukraine-war-has-stoked-global-food-crisis-that-could-last-years-says-un,2022-05-19T02:57:42Z,"Shortages of grain and fertiliser could cause ‘mass hunger and famine, says chief, as World Bank pledges $12bn to ease shortfall","The United Nations has warned that the war in Ukraine has helped to stoke a global food crisis that could last years if it goes unchecked, as the World Bank announced an additional $12bn in funding to mitigate its “devastating effects”. UN secretary general António Guterres said shortages of grain and fertiliser caused by the war, warming temperatures and pandemic-driven supply problems threaten to “tip tens of millions of people over the edge into food insecurity”, as financial markets saw share prices fall heavily again on fears of inflation and a worldwide recession. Speaking at a UN meeting in New York on global food security, he said what could follow would be “malnutrition, mass hunger and famine, in a crisis that could last for years”, as he and others urged Russia to release Ukrainian grain exports. He said he was in “intense contact” with Russia and other countries to try to find a solution. “The complex security, economic and financial implications require goodwill on all sides for a package deal to be reached,” he said of his discussions with Moscow, Ukraine, Turkey, the US, the European Union and others. “I will not go into details because public statements could undermine the chances of success.” Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and international economic sanctions on Russia have disrupted supplies of fertiliser, wheat and other commodities from both countries, pushing up prices for food and fuel, especially in developing nations. Together the warring nations produce 30% of the world’s wheat. Before the invasion in February, Ukraine was seen as the world’s bread basket, exporting 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports – 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn and half of its sunflower oil. But with the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and others cut off from the world by Russian warships, the supply can travel only on congested land routes that are far less efficient. Prices have skyrocketed. The UN’s food and agricultural price index reached an all-time high of almost 160 points in March before falling 1.2 or 0.8% in April. Cereal and meat price indices also hit record highs in March. A year ago wheat was trading in Chicago at US674c per bushel. Today it fetches US1,242c per bushel in a near-doubling of the price driven and compounded by the lack of supply. “Let’s be clear: there is no effective solution to the food crisis without reintegrating Ukraine’s food production,” Guterres said. “Russia must permit the safe and secure export of grain stored in Ukrainian ports.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken, who chaired the summit, echoed the call along with World Food Programme head David Beasley. Beasley said: “The world is on fire. We have solutions. We need to act and we need to act now.” In other Ukraine developments: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, used his nightly address to claim that Russia’s use of laser weapons to down drones to save stocks of conventional missiles “indicates the complete failure of the invasion” and that mistakes had been made at the highest level. He compared their use to propaganda efforts by Nazi Germany promoting a “wunderwaffe” or “wonder weapon”. Russia has claimed it is using a new generation of laser weapons to burn up drones. Zelenskiy said he had signed a decree to extend martial law by 90 days in order to allow further time to expel invasion forces. The decree needs to be approved by parliament. Sweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join Nato but Turkey blocked an early move to fast-track the Nordic countries’ requests, demanding they extradite “terrorists” and that the alliance respect its concerns. US president Joe Biden said Washington would in the meantime work with Finland and Sweden in the event of the “threat of aggression”. The US embassy in Kyiv has resumed operations, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said after nearly three months of closure. A small number of diplomats will return initially to staff the embassy, according to a spokesperson. G7 finance minister will meet in Brussels on Thursday hoping to find a solution for Kyiv’s budget troubles as the fallout from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to roil the global economy. The US has already pledged a $40bn aid package to fill Kyiv’s coffers and military stores. Soaring energy prices have also played a part in the current crisis by making it more expensive to produce fertiliser and to run farm equipment. Russia is the world’s top supplier of certain fertilisers and natural gas. The fertilisers are not subject to the western sanctions, but sales have been disrupted by measures taken against the Russian financial system while Moscow has also restricted exports, diplomats say. Guterres also said Russian food and fertilisers “must have full and unrestricted access to world markets”. The World Bank’s announcement will bring total available funding for projects over the next 15 months to $30bn. The new funding will help boost food and fertiliser production, facilitate greater trade and support vulnerable households and producers, the World Bank said. The bank previously announced $18.7bn in funding for projects linked to “food and nutrition security issues” for Africa and the Middle East, eastern Europe and central Asia, and south Asia. “Countries should make concerted efforts to increase the supply of energy and fertiliser, help farmers increase plantings and crop yields, and remove policies that block exports and imports, divert food to biofuel, or encourage unnecessary storage,” said World Bank president David Malpass. Financial markets have reflected fears about how disruption from the war will affect the world economy with stocks on Wall Street falling precipitously on Wednesday. The broadest index, the S&amp;P500, dropped 4.04% in its worst day for nearly two years after retailers led by Target said that supply chain problems and inflation – currently 8% in the US – were eating into profits. The losses sparked more selling in Asia Pacific at the start of trading on Thursday. The Hang Seng dropped 3% to take the index below 20,000 points for the first time in more than five years, while the Nikkei was off 2.5% in Tokyo and Seoul was down 1.55%. Hebe Chen, market analyst at IG in Sydney, said: “It must be said that the concern for inflation has never gone away since we stepped into 2022, however, while things haven’t reached the point of no return, they are seemingly heading in the direction of ‘out of control’. That, is probably the most worrying part for the market.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Devastation and defiance in Ukraine: 100 days of a war that is reshaping Europe,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/devastation-and-defiance-in-ukraine-100-days-of-a-war-that-is-reshaping-europe,2022-06-03T02:00:04Z,"How the Russian invasion has unfolded, from the desperate fight for Mariupol to economic turmoil around the world","It was just hours until the first missiles would land. The last day of an era in Europe. On the evening of 23 February, the world braced. Over Ukraine’s border, thousands of Russian troops had received their orders. A president in Kyiv and another in Moscow prepared the most significant addresses of their lives. In western capitals, officials worked to ward off what now seemed inevitable: the end of three decades of peace between Europe’s major powers. And the end of an idea. That trade and prosperity could dissolve old European rivalries. That access to iPhones, Instagram and Ikea furniture could cool the chauvinist impulses that had fuelled centuries of bloody history. In spite of unusually specific warnings from the US government of an imminent invasion, and the buildup of forces in Russia and Belarus, Ukrainians were not panicking. There were no queues at the western borders. The cafes and bars of Kyiv had been packed the previous Saturday evening. People continued making plans for holidays, dates, and swimming lessons for their children. Volodomyr Ksienich, 22, a student organiser, spent the night with friends. They talked about the war, of course. “Nobody really believed it would happen,” he says. Many analysts concurred. The Russian forces massing on the border were too few to occupy the country, they argued. State media had done little to prepare the Russian public for war. An invasion would trigger economic penalties so ruinous to the Russian economy that no leader would dare risk it. All of this was true, and they were wrong. * * * Day 1: Thursday 24 February Russian invasion begins The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, goes on TV in the early hours of Thursday with dire news. Dressed in a suit, his face still boyish and uncreased, Zelenskiy informs the country that after weeks of brinkmanship, Vladimir Putin has authorised military action against Ukraine. All of Europe is on the edge of a war that could “burn everything”, he says. At 5.30am, Russian state media begins broadcasting a presidential address. Incensed by what he characterises as the creation of an “anti-Russia” on his borders, Putin announces a “special military operation” aimed at the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine. As he is speaking and in the hours after, explosions are reported in Kyiv, Kramatorsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Mariupol and other cities. Ksienich is woken sharply by his father. “Did you hear that?” he asks him. “I think it’s bombs exploding. I think Russia’s started the war.” The family gather their belongings and head to his grandparent’s country home on Kyiv’s outskirts. It is on the drive, when Ksienich stops to refuel his car, that he feels himself cross a dividing line between life before the war and after. “I got out of my car and I heard bursts a couple of hundred metres from me,” he says. It is all still novel: the noise, the shaking ground, the impulse to flee and seek cover. He will grow weary of these sensations in the weeks to come, but the memory of this moment will still pierce through. “It was the first explosion I can remember.” Over the course of a chaotic day, Russian troops and military vehicles are reported to have come within 18 miles of the capital; to have swept through Chornobyl and taken workers there hostage; to have pushed into eastern towns such as Sumy; and to have rained missiles on port cities across the Black Sea. Russian hit squads are searching for the Ukrainian president and gunfire is heard near the presidential compound. There is a feeling of doom in Kyiv and around the world. By sunset, Ksienich’s family have gathered at the country house. Tomorrow they will need to decide whether to stay or go west. But first, they must survive the night. “We had a long discussion before going to bed, me and my relatives,” he recalls. “The Russian army could be trying to invade the place where we were staying. So we decided that some of us will sleep, some of us will not.” Ksienich is part of the shift that sleeps first. He has a fitful spell in bed, ruminating. “You understand that something terrible is happening in your country,” he says. After four hours, he gets up and takes his place on guard duty. * * * Day 2: Friday 25 February ‘The president is here’ Kyiv is being attacked from three directions. Blasts are being reported across the city. Gun battles are raging in its northern suburbs as Russian forces close in. Ukraine’s defence ministry urges those who have not fled to make molotov cocktails and prepare to use them. Mario Draghi, the Italian prime minister, tells parliament that Zelenskiy has missed a scheduled call that morning, pausing as his voice falters. The chamber fills the silence with spontaneous applause. Europe is uniting in revulsion and solidarity, imposing new sanctions, debating whether to excise Moscow from the Swift payments system. Russia is expelled from the Eurovision song contest. A few dozen miles from the city, Ksienich and his family decide to stay. “We decided we needed to try to protect ourselves, then to protect our family, then to protect the whole country, if it’s possible,” he says. The family get to work building makeshift barricades around their neighbourhood to slow oncoming tanks or armoured vehicles. They make contact with other men in the area and form a local defence unit. Ksienich is handed a Kalashnikov rifle several decades older than he is. Forty-eight hours ago he was a data analyst, but now he is learning to fight like an insurgent. “They told us what to do when a column is right near you,” he says. “What to do when you see a tank.” In the few quiet moments, he feels a moral vertigo. “You need to switch from a life where you are trying to solve all your conflicts verbally, by talking … But now you have ammo and a gun.” That night, during a pause in the shelling, the Ukrainian president resurfaces. He posts a 32-second video, shot on the streets of Kyiv himself. “Good evening, everyone,” he says, dressed in fatigues and surrounded by four other officials. He cycles the camera to each face – “The leader of the party is here. The head of the presidential administration is here” – and finally settles on his own. “The president is here.” * * * Day 3: Saturday 26 February Tens of thousands of Ukrainians rush to enlist Kyrylo Demchenko, a history student from Dnipro, joins the rush of young men signing contracts to enlist in the Ukrainian army. He is immediately handed a gun and sent to a highway at the edge of the capital. Hours after he arrives, Demchenko, 20, and his unit spot Russian soldiers and open fire. He survives, but has little memory of the exchange, only fleeting images. “It is so terrible, so cruel,” he says. “I remember the music of the war – the bomb attacks, the shooting of the guns. I remember the tracer bullets, lighting up when they fly. I remember the anti-aircraft missiles. I remember short, separate details. “It’s like a terrible story from a previous life.” * * * Day 4: Sunday 27 February West unites in response to invasion It is 3am, in a forest on the outskirts of Kyiv. Ksienich and a small unit of volunteers sit in silence, waiting for the telltale crack of a tree branch under a boot, or the rumble of a helicopter. Russian battalions are 5 or 6 kilometres away, he says, but the mood on the ground is buoyant. “The first day many people were depressed, we didn’t know how our army would do,” he says. “After two or three days we have understood our army is very well prepared … We are planning to get rid of all the Russian occupants and get back Crimea and the occupied territories.” Roads to the west of the country are choked with traffic and more than 300,000 Ukrainians have already fled the country. They are virtually all women and children; martial law has been instituted and men between 18 and 60 are banned from leaving. Across the country, families, friends and lovers are being divided, some for ever. Old maxims of European security are crumbling every hour. Germany is sending anti-tank weapons and Stinger missiles to Ukraine, breaking a postwar taboo against exporting arms to conflict zones. The chancellor, Olaf Scholz announces the creation of a €100bn (£85bn) fund to boost the country’s armed forces. He calls it “Germany’s historical responsibility” to ensure that Putin “does not turn the clocks back”. Four days in, Ukraine appears to have absorbed the initial Russian blow. Zelenskiy is still alive and in control of the government. Russian forces are uncoordinated, unable to take control of the airspace and running out of fuel and food. Hostomel airport, outside Kyiv, is the site of fierce fighting, preventing Russia from using it as a bridgehead into the capital. In Bucha, a commuter town near Kyiv, an invading Russian column is devastated by Ukrainian artillery and retreats. But the soldiers return after a few hours, occupy local homes and dig in. Putin’s plan appears not to have account for a decisive factor: that Ukrainian society would resist. That young, untrained people like Ksienich would take up guns, spend nights in a forest and risk death to defend their homes. * * * Day 9: Friday 4 March Combat reaches Europe’s largest nuclear plant Fighting in Ukraine’s east has reached the town of Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. To the horror of world leaders and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a building inside the facility is hit by Russian shells and is set ablaze. Miraculously, the damage does not extend to the reactors, avoiding a catastrophic nuclear release, though exchanges of gunfire and artillery around the site continue. “This is unprecedented,” says the IAEA’s director general, Rafael Mariano Grossi. “Completely uncharted waters.” The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, tells the security council the world has “narrowly averted a nuclear catastrophe”. In Mariupol, another disaster is taking shape. Hundreds of civilians have already died in shelling since the beginning of the war. The city is surrounded and its mayor, Vadym Boichenko, announces remaining residents no longer have heat, running water or electricity. * * * Day 15: Thursday 10 March UK sanctions Abramovich, signalling end of ‘Londongrad’ era Roman Abramovich, one of the world’s richest men, whose ownership of Chelsea football club has revolutionised the English Premier League, has his assets frozen and is banned from travelling to Britain. The sanctions against the oligarch – whose ties to Putin have been the subject of warnings for years – signal what campaigners hope is the end of London’s three-decade embrace of dirty Russian money. The number of Ukrainians who have fled their country passes 2 million, in the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since the second world war. * * * Day 17: Saturday 12 March Kyiv braces for invasion Russia’s attempt to push its forces towards Kyiv has hit a snag. Ukrainian forces have blown up bridges and flooded plains, forcing the bulk of columns on to a few narrow roads. The result has been a predictable traffic jam. But after a few days, forces appear to be regrouping for an assault on the capital. Kyiv is awash with anti-tank weapons, barricades and armed men. Ksienich has survived, and is stunned at the transformation of his home city, preparing for a battle “that could be compared to the battle for Kyiv in the second world war”. Ukraine is receiving equipment donated from around the world, including sniper scopes manufactured by the glass and crystals firm Swarovski. “It costs thousands of dollars,” he marvels. In a city bracing for war, there are still open cafes, barbers and other pockets of normal life. “It is even possible to eat yoghurt or ice-cream somewhere in the city,” Ksienich says. Moscow is making faster progress in Ukraine’s south. The strategic port of Kherson has become the first major city to fall to Russia. About 2,000 people are estimated to have attended a protest in the city against the occupation. Russian troops fire warning shots to disperse them, “but people are not afraid”, two anonymous diarists write. “But among the crowd, men in dark clothes are wandering, with hoods, hiding their faces, recording.” * * * Day 24: Saturday 19 March Mariupol theatre refuge struck by Russian missile Russia says it is “tightening the noose” in Mariupol. After relentless shelling that has destroyed more than 80% of residential buildings in the city, according to an estimate by its mayor, Russian forces have reached the centre and fighting has broken out around the Azovstal steelworks, a labyrinthine, Stalin-era facility that stretches for 10 sq km (4 sq miles), where hundreds of civilians are taking shelter. A few days earlier, Russia bombed a theatre where an estimated 1,300 civilians were taking shelter. The Russian word “ДЕТИ” – “children” – had been marked out in large letters outside the building, in a fruitless appeal to the humanity of the attackers. An Associated Press investigation later estimates that at least 600 people were killed in the strike. * * * Day 26: Monday 21 March Russian campaign in chaos as global food prices soar Just after midnight a Russian tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, publishes a report claiming 9,861 Russian troops have been killed so far and 16,153 have been wounded. The breathtaking three-week toll is approaching the number of Russian servicemen killed in Afghanistan during the Soviet Union’s decade-long failed occupation. By the end of the day, the figures have been removed from the story (the newspaper claims it was hacked) but its scale echoes what observers are seeing on the ground. The Russian campaign is indecisive, bogged down and pursuing too many targets at once. There is “no real centre of gravity, five to six different axes of advance”, says Michael Kofman, a specialist in the Russian armed forces. “The military is trying to stretch itself thin, they’re stuck in urban fighting around Kyiv in the north, they can’t make much press in the east around Kharkiv or Sumy.” Even in the south, where Russia’s forces are most numerous and making the most progress, they are trying to advance in two opposite directions, towards Mariupol in the east and west towards Odesa. “Which makes no sense whatsoever,” Kofman says. “None.” The pain of this misadventure is starting to be felt around the world. Egypt, which imports 80% of its grain from Russia and Ukraine, fixes the cost of bread in response to a surge in prices. The soaring cost of fuel compounds a severe currency crisis in Sri Lanka. The price of cooking oils, cereals and meats are on their way to the highest levels recorded by the United Nations since it started tracking in 1990. * * * Day 36: Thursday 31 March Russia announces ‘radical reduction’ in military activity Kyiv is quieter than it has been in weeks. “We don’t hear anything about [Russia] trying to capture the city any more,” Ksienich says. Days before, Russian negotiators at peace talks in Turkey made the surprise announcement that their forces would “radically reduce military activity” around Kyiv and another embattled city, Cherniyiv. The Ukrainian government is sceptical, but shelling in the capital has eased over the past week. Streets are busier and shops are reopening. “There are huge sales on everything because businesses aren’t sure if [their stock] in warehouses will be safe, because Russia is bombing warehouses full of food, clothes, oil,” Ksienich says. There is a feeling of relief in the city but also a building sense of dread at the rumours starting to emerge as Russian forces pull back. “Some friends of mine [are] in Irpin, a city near Kyiv that was captured,” Ksienich says. “Our army is there and many civilians tell scary things about how the Russians behaved there … They were just shooting civilians, driving tanks over them.” * * * Day 38: Saturday 2 April War crimes discovered in Bucha and recently liberated towns At 2.33pm London time, an alert is posted on the wire of the news service Agence France-Presse. It reads: “At least 20 bodies seen in one street in town near Kyiv.” It is accompanied by photographs and video footage documenting the streets of Bucha, a satellite city on the outskirts of the capital. They are scenes from hell: crushed neighbourhoods, bound corpses strewn in the roads and bodies hastily buried in the front yards of their homes. In a cellar, authorities find the body of a woman dressed in a fur coat and nothing else, and torn condom wrappers on the floor above. The discoveries immediately draw comparisons to the killings at Srebrenica or the My Lai massacre. “What Putin has done in Ukraine doesn’t look far short of genocide to me,” says the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson. Over the coming days, journalists reach further-flung villages and find similar horrors. In Trostianets, near the Russian border, there is evidence of summary executions and torture. In the village of Staryi Bykiv, 50 miles east of Kyiv, Russian soldiers killed at least nine civilians. From homes in Novyi Bykiv, a settlement just across a river, they looted items including jewellery, a scooter, computers and from one house, a novelty cushion, in an orgy of looting so widespread across areas occupied by the Russians that it appears to be a systematic part of military culture. Obscured by the grisly discoveries is a significant deadline: Friday was the end of the one-year term of tens of thousand of Russian conscripts, who are permitted to leave the army, despite rumours the Kremlin might seek ways to keep them in its ranks and bolster the invasion force. It sets the future shape of the war: Russia will not have the numbers to encircle and cut off Ukrainian troops in Donbas. Any future Russian gains in the east will come through grinding attrition. “They will have to fight for every square inch of territory,” Kofman says. * * * Day 43: Wednesday 7 April Rouble surges back to pre-invasion levels Russia’s currency, the rouble, hits 80 to the dollar, roughly its rate before it invaded Ukraine, an astounding rebound from the records lows of the early weeks of the war. The rouble’s resilience, despite suffocating sanctions and an exodus of foreign businesses, is based on short-term financial engineering, a surge in oil and gas prices caused by the invasion – and Europe’s inability to quickly find alternative supplies. Germany, whose economic model is built in part on cheap Russian gas, is weathering diplomatic pressure to impose an outright ban on imports, calls that have grown more urgent since the discovery of war crimes in Bucha and elsewhere. Germans are being urged to do their part by turning down thermostats and driving less, but business leaders such as Martin Brudermüller, the chief executive of BASF, one of Germany’s biggest chemical companies, is warning against drastic cuts. “Do we want to destroy the entire economy with our eyes open?” he asks. * * * Day 54: Monday 18 April Russia launches eastern offensive As Zelenskiy warns that Russia has commenced its campaign to seize all of the eastern Donbas region, at Mariupol’s sprawling Azovstal plant the few thousand remaining defenders and civilians – running out of food, water and medicine – are given a midday deadline to surrender. Those who do are “guaranteed to keep their lives”, the Russians say. They reject it. Kyiv has surprised the world and repelled the invaders, but success is bittersweet. So many have been killed or are still fighting, Ksienich says, while people in the capital begin to resume normal lives. “You see a guy in a military uniform with a gun, who is ready to defend our country. And then you see a guy coming from a bar who’s drunk … People are relaxing but I don’t think it’s right.” Early in the war, he felt confident Ukraine would expel Russian forces from Kyiv, Crimea and Donbas. Now he is more circumspect. “I hope we at least get our borders before the invasion started,” he says. * * * Day 61: Monday 25 April US appears to widen war aims Speaking in Poland after a surprise visit to Kyiv, Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, is asked if Washington’s goals in Ukraine have changed since the beginning of the war. He recites the administration’s standard line about helping Ukraine to defend its sovereignty. But this time, he adds something new and further-reaching. “We want to see Russia weakened to the degree that it can’t do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine,” Austin says. “It has already lost a lot of military capability. And a lot of its troops, quite frankly. And we want to see them not have the capability to very quickly reproduce that capability.” * * * Day 77: Wednesday 11 May Puppet rulers of Kherson float annexation As the fighting in the east settles into a grinding war of attrition, the puppet leadership of Kherson, captured by Russia early in the fighting, say they plan to seek annexation by Moscow, giving a hint of a possible future for other cities and towns seized by Russian forces. Across the occupied region, Russia has reportedly disappeared mayors, journalists and artists as it seeks to tighten its grip. In some areas it will soon introduce the rouble as an official currency and offer fast-tracked Russian passports to residents. * * * Day 83: Tuesday 17 May Mariupol falls as Sweden and Finland apply to join Nato Russia has won the battle for Mariupol but is losing its war against Nato’s encroaching alliance. Hours after Ukraine’s military command announces it is no longer defending the Azovstal plant, and the remaining fighters are bussed towards an uncertain future in Russia, the prime ministers of Sweden and Finland confirm they will jointly submit applications to become members of the group. If they succeed, the length of Nato’s border with Russia will double overnight. In a rare display of dissent in a country where criticising the war – or even referring to it as one – now attracts a prison sentence, a Russian retired colonel offers a withering assessment on state TV of an invasion that has cost thousands of lives for little territorial gain. “We are in total geopolitical isolation and the whole world is against us, even if we don’t want to admit it,” Mikhail Khodaryonok tells a dumbstruck panel show. * * * Day 85: Thursday 19 May US passes $40bn military and economic aid package The US and its Nato allies have walked a careful line so far, seeking to funnel weapons and aid to Ukraine without provoking Russia into widening the war beyond its borders. In recent weeks, sensing an opportunity to trap Russia in a quagmire, western powers are pushing that line further. The Biden administration passes a massive $40bn (£32bn) package of military and economic aid for Ukraine, and is shipping out long-range howitzers, armoured vehicles and kamikaze drones, a step up from the anti-tank missiles and small arms it sent earlier. It is now trumpeting its role training Ukrainian soldiers in how to use these weapons systems – and in providing intelligence that has helped killed a dozen Russian generals. With fighting now largely confined to the east, more than 1 million Ukrainian refugees have returned home, the government says. More than 5 million remain abroad in the largest displacement crisis of the 21st century. * * * Day 97: Tuesday 31 May Russia gaining ground in eastern war of attrition Russia is learning the lessons of its disastrous invasion. It has broken into Sievierodonetsk, the last major population centre in Luhansk province outside its control, by concentrating forces that earlier in the war it had spread thinly. Elsewhere in the east and south, it is digging in, fortifying its positions. The heavy fighting in the eastern regions, where Russia can more easily supply its troops, is taking a heavy toll on Ukraine’s defenders. Zelenskiy says 50 to 100 soldiers could be dying each day, in a rare estimate of combat casualties. Whatever triumphalism existed after Russia retreated from around Kyiv has evaporated. The country’s ports are being strangled by a blockade. Cities such as Kharkiv are still within reach of Russian artillery. Territory is expected to change hands back and forth over the next months as both militaries near exhaustion, pause to resupply and launch counter-offensives. It spells a war with no end in sight. Ksienich spends his days ferrying tools and summer clothes to friends fighting in the east. In the spare hours, he works his old job in Warsaw remotely. He makes his life in a void between war and peace. Even if the fighting ends soon, it will have changed his trajectory. He has given up his job overseas, and plans to do a degree in business. “I’m enrolling in how to run government and politics,” he says. “I want to come back to Ukraine [and] help my country.” Day 100: Friday 3 June Invasion midwifes a new nation Demchenko, the young historian, has become the sergeant of a logistics unit stationed near Kharkiv. He and his men sleep in muddy trenches and, when they are lucky, on the floor of farmhouses. He shrugs off the danger and discomfort. “When the missile or bullet is near to you, or a Russian artillery shot lands near to you, you understand your situation right now is not as good as it can be. I’m not with a glass of juice near the sea or in my favourite Carpathian mountains.” These difficult days are charged with a potent force, he says, a forging process he had only studied before in books. “Our company was [merged] with people from different socio-economic groups, from different cities, and all of them are very different. They have different educations, different professions, and right now we are together. “It’s amazing to see how different people make this new social construction, how they discuss each other, how they are thinking about their future together … This is like the birth of a new nation.” One hundred days since the invasion, Putin’s army has lost some battles and won others. But the Russian president’s rash invasion has become a strategic catastrophe. Ukraine is embattled but united. It has become the very “anti-Russia” the war was supposed to extinguish.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ryanair warns of ‘fragile’ recovery as Ukraine war and Covid push it to loss,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/ryanair-ukraine-war-covid-michael-oleary-profits,2022-05-16T07:53:24Z,Michael O’Leary says airline hopes to return to ‘reasonable profitability’ but declines to make forecasts,"Ryanair has warned of a “fragile” recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a €355m loss for the financial year. The Irish airline would aim for a “return to reasonable profitability” over the financial year to March 2023, it said on Monday, after it lost €1.4bn (£1.2bn) during the first two pandemic-affected financial years. Airlines have been hanging on for the return of passengers following two years of travel restrictions. There were high hopes for significant earnings in the 2022 summer holiday season after many countries lifted bans on tourism, but the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine plus staffing difficulties have clouded airlines’ prospects. Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said “we hope to return to reasonable profitability” in the coming year and highlighted “pent-up demand” despite uncertainty. The “recovery is strong but fragile”, he said. “With luck we’ll have a strong summer.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the rapid spread of the Omicron variant “immediately damaged close-in bookings and yields for the Christmas and Easter peak travel periods”, O’Leary said. Ryanair’s revenues tripled to €4.8bn in the year to 31 March 2022 compared with the first year of coronavirus lockdowns. The airline is planning to fly 165 million passengers in the current financial year, up from 97 million in the year to March, and above its peak of 149 million passengers in the years before Covid-19. Yet the company said that ticket pricing in the current financial quarter “continues to need stimulation” with lower prices to attract more customers. Airlines’ ability to attract customers at higher prices is likely to be affected in the coming months by the cost of living crisis, with families left with less money to spend after covering rising fuel and food prices. O’Leary nevertheless said the company was better placed than rivals and would expand its market share, opening 15 new bases and more than 700 new routes in the summer. Fares were higher than in 2019 for peak season flights, he said. “There’s a lot of capacity cutbacks and hopefully we’re going to be the beneficiaries of that.” Ryanair is not suffering from the recruitment problems experienced by rivals as they wait for security approvals, he said, despite being affected indirectly by “pinch points” in airports: “In Dublin, Berlin, there are big security queues, where they are struggling to get low-wage, frontline staff back into work.” O’Leary said: “We went out of our way during Covid to keep everybody employed, we kept all the pilots and cabin crew current … We didn’t fire people and aren’t trying to hire in the recovery where background checks are taking time.” “From our perspective – pilots, cabin crew, engineers we are in good shape, there’s a lot of flexibility hiring anyone on the continent, but the UK is troublesome post-Brexit.” Ryanair struck an agreement with unions to cut pay for much of the pandemic, to preserve jobs, and O’Leary said they were “entering a period of pay restoration” over three years, although he warned: “Covid’s not quite over yet. Passenger volumes are back but pricing isn’t yet.” Pilots’ union Balpa said they had “made huge sacrifices to help the company through the Covid crisis”, and said that with a return to profit, they “now need to see management acknowledge their loyalty”. O’Leary said he was concerned that rivals had “talked up” the prospects for a strong summer, and that there was a need for caution going into the winter because of the possibility of a new coronavirus variant or a worsening global economy amid global inflationary pressures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘It was happy and sad’: sisters reunited after 20 years by war in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/it-was-happy-and-sad-sisters-reunited-after-20-years-by-war-in-ukraine,2022-05-09T10:03:09Z,"Adopted at eight, Tatyana was 2,000 miles away in Spain, but when Russian troops amassed she begged Angelika to join her","A cry of joy rang out as the two young women – one reeling from a 34-hour trek out of Ukraine and the other just off a late-night work shift – spotted each other on a pavement in Catalonia. The reunion had been decades in the making, the final details hastily hashed out as Russian tanks rolled on to the streets of Ukraine. “The moment was both happy and sad,” said Angelika Batiai, 24. “Here I was seeing my sister again after 20 years, but on the other hand I had just left my family and friends in a country at war.” The half-sisters had spent the first years of their lives together in the southern Ukrainian village of Nikolaev, leaning on each other as they grew up with only an absentee mother to care for them. Family problems left them separated soon after; five-year-old Angelika was sent to live with an aunt and Tatyana, six, with a grandmother before ending up in state care. They begged to be kept together, recalled Tatyana Kluge García, 25. “But economically it was impossible, Angelika’s aunt couldn’t afford to take us both in.” At the age of eight, Tatyana was adopted by a family in the Spanish city of Girona, near Barcelona, trading her arduous beginning for a new family, country and slate of languages. Even as her command of Ukrainian faded, her sister remained constantly in her thoughts. “I always said that I would go to Ukraine and find her,” said Tatyana. As a teenager she scoured social media for any trace of her sister, even downloading the Russian social network VK at one point. More than 2,000 miles away in Ukraine, Angelika was doing the same. When she stumbled across a Facebook profile in 2019 that showed a beaming young woman in Spain, she was certain she had found Tatyana. “I just knew it was my sister.” Within weeks the two were chatting constantly online, pushing past language and cultural barriers. “It was like a girlfriend that you’re getting to know but really it’s your sister and you want to share your life with her,” said Tatyana. Excitedly they made plans to meet up in Spain, only to have the possibility derailed by the pandemic. In February, as Russian troops amassed on the border of Ukraine, Tatyana made a frantic call to Angelika. “I told her that here they’re saying that there’s going to be a war,” she said. Angelika sought to temper her sister’s fears. “I was hoping all of this would blow over and everything would be fine,” she said. “But it just got worse and worse.” She and her fiance left their home in Nova Odesa, heading to a nearby village where her cousin had converted his basement into a makeshift shelter. As the sound of bombings cracked in the distance, they would dart into the basement. “Tatyana was texting me every day, saying pack up, we’re all waiting for you, we’re worried,” she said. Angelika canvassed those around her, but her loved ones were determined to stay. “It was a very difficult decision because I didn’t want to leave my family,” she said. “I was also very worried about how I was going to get there on my own – it was a long way.” In the end it was a message from Tatyana’s mother, reinforcing that she would be safe in Spain, that convinced Angelika. She set off for the Polish border in a vehicle with other Ukrainians looking to leave, steeling herself for the worst. “I was terrified we would be detained or that there would be an air alert,” said Angelika. Her anxiety was laced with nervousness for what lay ahead: “The whole way I was thinking about what it would be like to see my sister and whether she would accept me,” she said. From her home in Girona, Tatyana tracked Angelika’s every step. She bought her a plane ticket from Warsaw, battling spotty mobile coverage and language barriers to make sure her sister made it on to the flight. “I was going crazy,” said Tatyana. “She had never been on a plane, she didn’t know how to check in or check her baggage.” The days of anxiety melted away as soon as she spotted her sister. “I had always wondered what that moment would be like,” said Tatyana. “You think: ‘Maybe I’ll be in shock, maybe I won’t know what to say, maybe I’ll cry.’ But in the end I just couldn’t believe it was happening.” In the month since Angelika’s arrival in Spain, the sisters have carved out a comfortable coexistence in Tatyana’s apartment, using hand gestures, a handful of shared vocabulary and a lot of Google Translate to communicate. The ease of their interactions belies their decades apart; Angelika, who hates carrying a handbag, stuffs her phone and charger into her older sister’s purse whenever they leave the house, while the two trade quiet nods of affirmation as they delve into the details of their past. “There are days that go by and I’m looking at her and I still can’t believe it,” said Tatyana. “I just think: ‘You’re here.’” Echoing the uncertainty facing many of the 135,000 Ukrainian refugees who have arrived in Spain in recent months, neither sister knows what comes next: whether Angelika will eventually return to her fiance, job and family in Ukraine, or seek to bring them to Spain and start over. “Since we were little we’ve been dreaming of seeing each other again, but we would never have imagined that it would be because of a war,” said Tatyana. For Angelika, being back with her sister was a “wonderful, unbelievable feeling”. The joy, however, was rivalled by the angst of leaving her loved ones in a country at war. “I just can’t stop thinking about it.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How Russia and Ukraine are wielding hi-tech weaponry to win the war | John Naughton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/07/how-russia-and-ukraine-are-finding-new-ways-to-use-tech-in-the-war,2022-05-07T15:00:03Z,Facial recognition and crypto-savviness are just some of the strategies being deployed by both sides in the conflict,"One of the few welcome surprises of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine was the speed and apparent effectiveness of western governments’ imposition of conventional sanctions on his country. In short order, half of Russia’s $600bn foreign reserves held in western financial institutions was immediately frozen. The country was expelled from Swift, the vast messaging network that banks use to transfer money across the world. PayPal, Visa and Mastercard abruptly ceased to work in Russia. There was an immediate ban on technology transfers from the west. Then there was the sudden sanctioning of Putin-friendly oligarchs and those who service them in London. Trebles all round, then? Only up to a point: some of the successes involve measures that in other contexts are deeply toxic. Russian troops, for example, have been nabbing high-end John Deere tractors in Ukraine and shipping them back to Mother Russia. But when the lucky beneficiaries of these wondrous machines attempt to start them up, they discover that John Deere has remotely “bricked” them – ie turned them into multi-ton paperweights. Which is why many western farmers detest John Deere. Having paid a fortune for their new tractors, they find that they are not allowed to repair them themselves and any attempt to download bootleg software to diagnose malfunctions may get them into legal trouble on intellectual-property and user-agreement grounds. Similarly, Ukraine has been using another toxic technology – facial recognition – to identify dead Russian soldiers. Forbes magazine reported in March that Mykhailo Fedorov, vice prime minister of Ukraine and minister of digital transformation, had confirmed on his Telegram channel that the country was using the software to find the social media accounts of deceased Russian soldiers, allowing authorities to contact their friends and families. The aim, he said, is to dispel misinformation surrounding the war in the country and, specifically, Russian claims that it is just a special operation with few losses. He did not specify which particular technology had been used, but his department later confirmed to Forbes that it was Clearview AI, which the American firm had provided to the Ukrainian government free of charge. So what’s the problem? Only that Clearview AI, a company backed by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, among others, is pretty controversial back home. In February, a group of US senators and representatives issued a call to federal agencies to avoid using its “particularly dangerous” technology, which “poses unique threats to Black communities, other communities of colour and immigrant communities”. Thus technology taketh away and technology also giveth, as the Old Testament might put it. But the tech that is suddenly on everyone’s mind in relation to sanctions and Russia is blockchain, the software that underpins cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and the like. These currencies have been proliferating like wildfire for some years, and I long ago lost count of them all, but in essence they all have one thing in common: they’re decentralised payment systems that can enable anyone to transfer value to someone else anywhere. And because every part of the process is heavily encrypted and unsupervised by any authoritative institution such as a central bank, cryptocurrencies are clearly useful for money laundering – and for evading sanctions. Whatever else it is, Russia seems to be a crypto-savvy country. An official government estimate puts local holdings of cryptocurrencies at $200bn, which is, at a guess, 12% of the world total. Another survey, by a Singapore-based crypto payment gateway, concluded that 17 million Russians own cryptocurrencies and that upwards of half a million computer programmers work in the industry. And Russia is currently third in terms of Bitcoin network-mining activity – apparently with government backing; Putin has called for the use of surplus energy for crypto mining. Given that, it would be surprising if the regime did not have a strategy for using cryptocurrencies as a way of dodging or undermining sanctions. This would be a viable option for individual Russian citizens seeking to trade with others outside the country (or even to protect their savings at a time when the rouble has crashed). But for an economy the size of Russia, crypto transactions on the scale required to offset the impact of sanctions would be much too large to conceal from western governments. For once, there’s no technical fix for the problem that Putin has created for his country… and for the world.

"Russia-Ukraine war: Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk being ‘levelled’, says Luhansk governor, as Russian shelling intensifies – live",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/06/russia-ukraine-war-latest-putin-warns-of-new-targets-zelenskiy-visits-troops-on-eastern-front-live,2022-06-06T15:24:00Z,Governor of Luhansk compares cities in region with situation in Mariupol and says Russian shelling has increased tenfold,"An investigative journalist known for his coverage of Russian security agencies said he has been placed on a wanted list and that Russian authorities had frozen his bank accounts. Andrei Soldatov, who co-founded the Agentura.ru website, tweeted that his accounts in Russian banks “are under arrest, plus I’m placed on Russia’s wanted list”. In a separate post on Telegram, Soldatov said the case against him had been filed in a manner similar to that of two journalists accused of spreading “fake information” about Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine. Russia’s interior ministry website listed Soldatov as wanted under an unspecified article of the criminal code, Reuters reports. Italy summoned Russia’s ambassador to protest over allegations by Moscow that the Italian media were waging an anti-Russian propaganda campaign through their coverage of the Ukraine war. Italy’s foreign ministry said it called in ambassador Sergey Razov to reject “insinuations concerning the alleged involvement of our country’s media in an anti-Russian campaign”, it said in a statement. It added that it “firmly rejected accusations of amorality” levelled at unnamed Italian officials and journalists by the Russian foreign ministry. On Saturday, the Russian embassy in Rome posted on Facebook purported extracts from a report by the Russian foreign ministry on the “violation of Russian citizens’ rights” abroad. The report criticised “an open anti-Russian campaign in the Italian media” since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, a “biased approach” which it said “has a key influence on the attitude of Italians towards Russians”. The “great campaign launched in Italy against Russian culture and its representatives has led to a series of unpleasant incidents”, it said, including alleged discrimination in the healthcare and banking sectors. In a separate post, the embassy said Razov had repudiated the criticism during his meeting with the secretary general of Italy’s foreign ministry. Razov “pointed out that the propaganda line that is dominating in the Italian media can hardly be qualified otherwise than as hostile”, the embassy said. It claimed the ambassador “called for moderation and balance, traditional for Italian foreign policy, in the interest of maintaining positive relations and cooperation between the Russian and Italian peoples in the long term”. The UK Ministry of Justice has announced a second tranche of support for the international criminal court’s (ICC) investigations into war crimes in Ukraine, including the deployment of a specialist legal and police team. Karim Khan QC, the court’s chief prosecutor, was due in London on Monday to provide an update on the progress of the investigation, although his trip was later cancelled due to illness. The deputy prime minister, Dominic Raab, will present further support to the independent investigation on top of the £1m of funding provided earlier this year. The package includes a police liaison officer based in The Hague to lead on information sharing between the UK and the ICC, and seven legal experts to support the ICC with expertise in international criminal law and the handling of evidence to be presented to court. The UK will also provide two police officers with expertise in the collection of intelligence through publicly available data sources, ongoing defence analysis and monitoring of events in Ukraine, as well as war crimes investigation training to Ukrainian police on behalf of the ICC, in collaboration with Norwegian police. Raab said: The UK has responded swiftly to a request from the international criminal court for more police and lawyers to aid their investigation into Russian war crimes in Ukraine. Russian forces should know that they will be held to account for their actions and the global community will work together to ensure justice is served. The attorney general, Suella Braverman, added: Following my appointment of war crimes expert Sir Howard Morrison as an independent adviser to the Ukrainian prosecutor general’s office, I am determined that British expertise continues to be available to our friends in Ukraine in their search for justice. We will stand side by side as they uncover the truth and hold those responsible in Putin’s regime to account for their actions. The ICC launched its war crimes investigation into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in March after an unprecedented number of countries backed the move and Boris Johnson called the military intervention “abhorrent”. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said there could be as much as 75 million tonnes of grain stuck in Ukraine by this autumn, and that Kyiv wanted anti-ship weapons that could secure the safe passage of its exports. Zelenskiy told a briefing in Kyiv that Ukraine has been discussing with Britain and Turkey the idea of a third country’s navy guaranteeing the passage of Ukrainian grain exports through the Russia-dominated Black Sea. The strongest guarantee of their safe passage, though, would be Ukrainian weaponry, Reuters reports he told the media. As well as the court fine for Radio Liberty/Radio Free Moscow, today was the day that US media outlets were due to be summoned to Russia’s foreign ministry. Guy Faulconbridge is reporting for Reuters what they claim to be an exclusive from sources who have said what happened at the meeting. Maria Zakharova, Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, is said to have outlined the difficulties for Russian journalists there, including over visa renewals, blocked bank accounts and alleged harassment by US intelligence agencies, according to three Reuters sources with direct knowledge of the meeting. Zakharova warned the outlets that if Russian journalists were not able to work freely in the US, their reporters in Russia risked facing similar difficulties with their visas, media accreditation and bank accounts. According to the Reuters report, she told the US media representatives that unless things changed, the US journalists would have to leave. She added that Russia did not want to do this but was being forced to because of the plight of Russian journalists. Zakharova did not respond to a written request to comment on the meeting from Reuters. It is not known whether the timing of the meeting – on 6 June, when Ukraine is celebrating a day recognising journalists – was deliberate or coincidental. The RIA state news agency said that representatives of the Wall Street Journal, CNN, Associated Press and NPR attended the meeting. President Vladimir Putin signed a law in March imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally “fake” news about the military, prompting some western media to pull their journalists out of Russia. A Moscow court has fined US-backed broadcaster Radio Liberty/Radio Free Europe 20m roubles (£260,000/$325,214) over what it deems to be “fake” content about Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine, according to reports from Russia’s Interfax news agency. Reuters notes that Russia’s communications watchdog Roskomnadzor blocked the websites of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and some other foreign media in early March. Here are some more of the latest images sent to us from Ukraine over the newswires. European unity over the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is proving difficult to maintain in the face of the war’s impact on inflation and living standards across the continent, Estonia’s prime minister has said. Kaja Kallas also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for trying to provide Vladimir Putin with a diplomatic way out of the conflict, saying the only effect was to give the Russian leader the belief that he will not be isolated or face justice for his army’s war crimes. “We are at a point when sanctions start to [damage] our side,” said Kallas, who has gained a growing reputation for standing up to Putin. At first the sanctions were only difficult for Russia but now we are coming to a point when the sanctions are painful for our own countries, and now the question is how much pain are we willing to endure. It is different for different countries. The unity is very hard to keep. It is getting more and more difficult because of high inflation, and energy prices. She added: Gas might be expensive, but freedom is priceless. People living in the free world do not really understand that. She said that as a teenager she had been liberated from a Russian totalitarian prison – Estonia was annexed by the USSR until 1991. “I know what it feels like and this is the experience of central and eastern countries,” she said. But this is an experience that some western European countries do not have, so the values might go out of the window as soon as you feel the pain on your side. Ukraine has concentrated enough forces to repel Russian attacks in Sievierodonetsk but neither side is preparing to withdraw, according to the city’s mayor, Oleksandr Stryuk. Street fighting rages in the frontline eastern city, Stryuk said, adding that Ukraine had “focused enough forces and resources there to beat back attacks” by Russia. In separate comments, defence ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Russia was not sparing troops or equipment in its push to capture Sievierodonetsk, the largest remaining Ukrainian-controlled city in the Luhansk region. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said Moscow would respond to western deliveries of long-range weapons to Ukraine by pushing back Kyiv’s forces further from Russia’s borders. It comes after the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, said Britain will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems to Ukraine. Reuters has quoted Lavrov as saying at a news conference: The longer the range of the systems that will be delivered, the further we will move back the Nazis from that line from which threats to Russian-speakers and the Russian Federation may come. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has urged countries not to trust Vladimir Putin’s promises not to use trade routes to attack the southern port city of Odesa. Putin has said Ukraine could use the ports of Mykolayiv and Odesa for food exports, and that Russia would not use the mine clearance situation to launch “some attacks from the sea”. Kuleba tweeted: Putin says he will not use trade routes to attack Odesa. This is the same Putin who told German Chancellor Scholz and French President Macron he would not attack Ukraine – days before launching a full-scale invasion of our country. We can not trust Putin, his words are empty. Here’s more on the call between Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson. The pair discussed efforts to end Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports, a Downing Street spokesperson said. A No 10 statement said: The leaders also discussed diplomatic negotiations and efforts to end the damaging Russian blockade of Ukraine’s grain exports. The Kremlin has described a move by three eastern European countries to block the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, from flying to Serbia as a “hostile action”. Lavrov was due to hold talks in Belgrade today with the Serbian president, Aleksandar Vučić, but was forced to cancel his visit after the countries around Serbia – Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro – closed their airspace to his aircraft. Lavrov described the move to block his plane as “unprecedented” and said he would invite his Serbian counterpart to visit him in Moscow instead. He told reporters: If a visit by the Russian foreign minister to Serbia is seen in the west as something approaching a threat on a universal scale, then things in the west are clearly pretty bad. Serbia is one of Moscow’s few remaining allies in Europe since Russian troops invaded Ukraine in February. While Serbia has condemned Russia’s military action in Ukraine, it has not joined the EU in imposing sanctions on Moscow, despite its bid to join the bloc. Serbia’s interior minister, Aleksandar Vulin, said he deeply regretted “the obstruction” of the visit of Lavrov, whom he described as “a great and proven friend of Serbia”. He said those countries who blocked his plane “do not want peace, they dream of defeating Russia”. Vulin said: Serbia is proud that it is not part of the anti-Russian hysteria, and the countries that are will have time to be ashamed. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, called the move “another closed channel of communication” in comments reported by Russian news agencies. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he spoke with Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, who confirmed a new package of UK military aid to Kyiv. The pair are “looking for ways to avoid the food crisis and unblock ports”, Zelenskiy tweeted. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam today. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukrainian partisans in occupied areas of the country are increasing attacks and sabotage efforts on Russian forces and their local collaborators, with organised underground efforts appearing to spread, Peter Beaumont and Isobel Koshiw report. Six Russian border guards were reportedly killed last week when their position came under fire near the Zernovo border checkpoint in Ukraine’s north. Two days later an explosion struck close to the office of Yevgeny Balitsky, a pro-Kremlin Ukrainian official in Melitopol. The increase in partisan warfare, particularly in the country’s south around Kherson, follows warnings at the outset of Russia’s war against Ukraine that any area under occupation was likely to see the emergence of guerrilla warfare. The subject is one of the murkiest of the war in Ukraine. Both sides have an interest in exaggerating its prevalence: the Russians to justify crackdowns in areas they occupy and the Ukrainians to demoralise Russian troops. Also complicating the issue is assessing the extent to which attacks are being carried out by Ukrainian military sabotage groups or homegrown resistance groups. Partisans are usually defined as members of an armed group formed to fight secretly against an occupying force, for instance in Nazi-occupied Europe. The term holds more positive connotations than insurgent. The Melitopol incident, involving a car packed full of explosives, was significant enough to focus renewed attention on a phenomenon that has been occurring since almost the beginning of the war. The UN nuclear watchdog is “developing the modalities” for an international mission of experts it hopes to send to the Russian-held nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia in south-east Ukraine, its chief, Rafael Grossi, said. In a statement to the International Atomic Energy Agency’s 35-nation board of governors, Grossi said: We are developing the modalities to dispatch such a mission; other considerations should not prevent this essential international mission from taking place. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is Europe’s largest and has been occupied by Russian troops since shortly after they invaded Ukraine. The facility is still operated by Ukrainian technicians. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, where Ukraine claims to be fighting back in one of the war’s biggest ground battles. Russian forces continue to storm the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and fired missiles at the nearby cities of Sloviansk, Lysychansk and Orikhove, Ukraine’s military has said. Russian troops fired at Ukrainian units defending Sievierodonetsk with mortars and artillery fire, damaging infrastructure in the towns of Metolkino, Borivske, Ustynivka and Toshkivka. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has reported today that the situation has worsened a little for Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk and that there is intense street fighting. He told national television: “Our defenders managed to undertake a counterattack for a certain time; they liberated almost half of the city. But now the situation has worsened a little for us again.” Haidai also said that “the number of shellings in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk increased tenfold. In the Luhansk region there are many cities with a situation comparable to Mariupol: now the Russians are levelling Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.” A total of 262 children have been killed and 467 injured since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to newly released figures from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. Oleksandr Senkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has reported on Telegram that there have been explosions in the city. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has posted to Telegram to say that one person has been killed and five people have been injured in the last 24 hours by Ukrainian shelling into the occupied territory of Donetsk. The Russian missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday was likely an attempt to disrupt the supply of western military equipment to frontline Ukrainian units, according to British intelligence. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Anthony Albanese, Australia’s new prime minister, has confirmed Australia will attend the G20 meeting in Bali in November despite Russia’s controversial attendance at the summit. Russia should not close the US embassy in Moscow despite the crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine because the world’s two biggest nuclear powers must continue to talk, the US ambassador to Moscow, John J Sullivan, was quoted as saying. Nato kicked off a nearly two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, air personnel and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden – who aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support, according to government sources cited by newspaper El País. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn (£4.27bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later on. Léonie Chao-Fong is taking over the live blog. Russia’s Kursk region governor Roman Starovoit is in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic in Ukraine today. He has posted to his Telegram account: The main task of the working trip is to get acquainted with the Pervomaisk district, over which the Kursk region took patronage. I plan to visit social facilities during the day, where our help is needed in the first place. I know there are many problems in the cities and villages of the Kursk region. But now, as a human being, we cannot leave our people in a difficult situation. Pervomaisk is in the area of Crimea previously annexed by Russia. Earlier Starovoit reported on Telegram that Tetkino in the Kursk region, which is just over the border from Ukraine, was shelled by Ukrainian forces. More than 100 days into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, China’s strategic assessment of the conflict is becoming clearer: it does not wish to be cast in the same light as Russia, but the war has deepened Beijing’s mistrust of the west. In Beijing’s view, the pessimism has been exacerbated by the US and its allies’ recent efforts, for example, to help Taiwan increase its international recognition. On Monday last week, Beijing made the second-largest incursion into Taiwan’s air defence zone this year, with Taipei reporting 30 jets entering the area, including more than 20 fighters. China’s tone has also evolved from sitting on the fence to outright defensive. When the conflict first began in late February, Beijing tried to be “impartial”, but in the last few weeks, it deployed the language that directly confronted the US-led Nato and western sanctions, calling them “financial terrorism” and “economic weaponisation”. Read more from our China affairs correspondent Vincent Ni here: Ukraine war deepens China’s mistrust of the west Anthony Albanese, Australia’s new prime minister, has confirmed Australia will attend the G20 meeting in Bali in November despite Russia’s controversial attendance at the summit, with the prime minister also pledging to assist Indonesia as host of the leaders meeting. With some world leaders signalling they may not attend the event if Russia comes, Indonesia as the summit host has arranged for the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, to make a virtual appearance. On Monday, Albanese told his host, the Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, that Australia would come to Bali in November because the G20 “is critical at this time of global economic uncertainty, and it will be by working with Indonesia that we most effectively tackle the many challenges we face in navigating the post-Covid global economic recovery”. Read more of Katharine Murphy’s report here: Anthony Albanese tells Joko Widodo he will go to the G20 in Indonesia despite Russia’s attendance Russia should not close the US embassy despite the crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine because the world’s two biggest nuclear powers must continue to talk, the US ambassador to Moscow was quoted as saying today. In what looks like a clear attempt to send a message to the Kremlin, John J Sullivan, the US ambassador appointed by the former president Donald Trump, told Russia’s state Tass news agency that Washington and Moscow should not simply break off diplomatic relations. “We must preserve the ability to speak to each other,” Sullivan told Tass in an interview. He cautioned against the reported removal of the works of Leo Tolstoy from Western bookshelves or refusing to play the music of Pyotr Tchaikovsky. His remarks were reported by Tass in Russian and translated into English by Reuters. 6 June is celebrated as day of the journalist in Ukraine, and several civic leaders in the country have been posting in praise of the domestic journalists who have been covering the war. Typical is this message from Mykolaiv mayor Oleksandr Senkevych, who said: In peacetime, I would like to wish you interesting texts, bright characters and sensational investigations – all that is highly valued in your profession. But today you all had to become military correspondents. At the risk of your life, you keep your information front every day and tell the truth about the situation in the country, the consequences of insidious enemy shelling and the heroism of Ukrainians. You show the stories of our strong warriors, fearless doctors and tireless volunteers. Sincere thanks to each of you. I wish you good health and unwavering faith in our victory. Among the claims in today’s operational briefing from Russia’s ministry of defence are that: air defence shot down a Ukrainian MiG-29 aircraft near the village of Slavyansk in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. 13 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles were destroyed. missile troops and artillery hit 431 areas of accumulation of manpower and military equipment. they claim to have killed over 300 Ukrainian forces, and to have destroyed 10 tanks, two Grad multiple rocket launchers, 17 special vehicles, 17 field artillery pieces and mortars, and a US-made counter-battery radar AN/TPQ-50. None of the claims have been independently verified. There have been some more updates on Telegram from civic leaders in Ukraine. Oleksandr Senkevych, mayor of Mykolaiv, has said “Explosions are heard in the city. Friends, I ask everyone to go to the shelters. At the very least, follow the rules of the two walls.” Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, said that where were no air raid warnings overnight – in contrast to Kyiv region which was struck by missiles. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has added some more detail to his reports of the situation around Sievierodonetsk. He posted that “the number of shellings in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk increased tenfold. In the Luhansk region there are many cities with a situation comparable to Mariupol: Now the Russians are levelling Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk.” There are some further lines on Reuters from the governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai. It reports he has said: the situation has worsened a little for Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk. there is intense street fighting raging in the city. Ukrainian forces are holding positions in the city’s industrial zone. Speaking on national television, Haidai said: “Our defenders managed to undertake a counterattack for a certain time; they liberated almost half of the city. But now the situation has worsened a little for us again.” The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic has posted to Telegram to say that one person has been killed and five people have been injured in the last 24 hours by Ukrainian shelling into the occupied territory of Donetsk. This is Martin Belam on the live blog now, you can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com In 2014, the photojournalist Sergey Korovayny watched Russian forces take his home town, Khartsyzsk in Donetsk region. Eight years later, with the next invasion by Russia, he and his family fled their new home in Kyiv. The situation prompted Korovayny to track down others from Russian-controlled areas of Ukraine who have also had to flee for a second time. “Is it harder to lose their home again? Or do they already have these survival skills?” he asked. “Did they have the full tank of gas and luggage ready? And where are those homes now?” In this photo essay, Korovayny meets the 2014 Ukraine refugees forced to flee for a second time: Russian forces continue to storm the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk and fired missiles at the nearby cities of Sloviansk, Lysychansk and Orikhove, Ukraine’s military has said. Russian troops fired at Ukrainian units defending Sievierodonetsk with mortars and artillery fire, damaging infrastructure in the towns of Metolkino, Borivske, Ustynivka and Toshkivka, according to the latest operational report released by Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces. Russian forces are also shelling the civilian infrastructure of the settlements of Chernihiv and Sumy, the military claims. The parliamentary committee on Ukraine’s integration into the EU will hold a meeting today in order to draft bills on the adaptation of EU legislation, an official press release reads. According to the draft agenda, the committee will focus on discussing a draft law on ratification of the agreement between Ukraine and the Netherlands on paid activities of family members of diplomatic and other personnel of diplomatic missions. Other topics of discussion will include a draft law on amendments to certain laws of Ukraine concerning the recognition in Ukraine of the results of conformity assessment conducted in the member states of the European Union. A total of 262 children have been killed and 467 injured since Russia invaded Ukraine, according to newly released figures from Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office. The Russian missile attack on Kyiv early on Sunday was likely an attempt to disrupt the supply of western military equipment to frontline Ukrainian units, according to British intelligence. The report, released by the UK Ministry of Defence, reads: In the early hours of 5 June, Russian Kh-101 air-launched cruise missiles struck rail infrastructure in Kyiv, likely in an attempt disrupt the supply of western military equipment to frontline Ukrainian units. In the Donbas, heavy fighting continues in the contested town of Sievierodonetsk and Russian forces continue to push towards Sloviansk as part of their attempted encirclement of Ukrainian forces.” Following the loss of the Russian cruiser Moskva in April, Russian forces have likely moved multiple air defence assets to Snake Island in the western Black Sea, the report adds. At sea, following the loss of the cruiser Moskva in April, Russian forces have likely moved multiple air defence assets to Snake Island in the western Black Sea, including SA-15 and SA-22 systems. It is likely these weapons are intended to provide air defence for Russian naval vessels operating around Snake Island. Russia’s activity on Snake Island contributes to its blockade of the Ukrainian coast and hinders the resumption of maritime trade, including exports of Ukrainian grain.” Here are some of the latest images to be sent over our newswires from Ukraine. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, argued the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. The move risks further provoking an already irritated Kremlin. The UK, in conjunction with the US and other western nations, began the war by promising only to supply “defensive weaponry” to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. But as Russia has made gains in the east and the south of the country, western countries have gradually sent more lethal arms. London said it had been cooperating closely with Washington. The British announcement comes a few days after the US said it would send four similar truck-mounted Himars systems. The US and UK systems are intended to be complementary. The ranges of both are far greater than any land weapons Ukraine currently has. Like the US, the UK has sought assurances from Kyiv that the M270s would not be used to strike targets within Russia. A British defence source said the weapons will be used “to defend Ukraine, in Ukraine”. They added: “We have confidence that the weapons will be used appropriately.” Britain did not say how many M270s it was sending, although the number is small and will be comparable to the US decision to send four Himars. Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, the MoD added, and Kyiv’s forces will be supplied with the appr",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
priate rockets “at scale”. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. Columns of smoke were seen rising over the city after missiles hit the eastern outskirts, injuring at least one person, according to the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko. Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes had targeted tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of the city. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said. The attack, the first to hit Kyiv in five weeks, represents a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. Video of the aftermath can be seen in the footage below. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, earlier warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. In an interview with Rossiya-1 state television, and without specifying what those targets were, Putin said: We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting.” The Russian president’s comments come after President Joe Biden last week said Washington would supply Ukraine with M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, after he received assurances from Kyiv that it would not be used to target Russia. Putin said the arms shipments were “nothing new” and “doesn’t change anything in essence” but cautioned that there would be a response if the United States supplied longer-range munitions for the HIMARS systems which have a maximum range of up to 300km (185 miles) or more. If longer-range missiles are supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin said. Putin did not identify the targets Russia would strike, but said the “fuss” around western arms supplies was designed to drag out the conflict. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, where Ukraine claims to be fighting back in one of the war’s biggest ground battles. The president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,” the statement read. In two separate videos, Zelenskiy was shown talking to troops in confined, bunker-like structures, presenting some with awards and addressing others. “What you all deserve is victory – that is the most important thing. But not at any cost,” Zelenskiy said in one of the videos. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region’s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. “Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,” Starukh said. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. Russian president Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made after the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am on Sunday, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. “It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Haidai told Ukrainian television. “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday. Zelenskiy said he travelled to Lysychansk – just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk – and Soledar, two cities very close to some of the most intense fighting. Nato kicked off a nearly two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, air personnel and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden – who aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” Gen Mark Milley, chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, said. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support, according to government sources cited by newspaper El País. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn (£4.27bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives.

Ukraine refugees in UK face waits of up to two years for war trauma therapy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/ukraine-refugees-uk-face-waits-two-years-war-trauma-therapy,2022-05-09T06:00:24Z,"Services across country are patchy with some areas ‘treatment deserts’ when it comes to trauma, say experts","Traumatised Ukrainian refugees who have sought sanctuary in the UK may have to wait two years before they can get specialised therapy to help them heal from the horrors of war, according to experts. Therapists who specialise in treating war trauma say they have seen NHS waiting lists of two years before refugees can access the specialist treatment they need. Services across the UK are patchy with some areas “treatment deserts when it comes to trauma”, according to Emily Palmer-White, a psychotherapist and community manager at the charity Room to Heal, which provides support for people who have fled persecution. “There are often extremely long waiting lists. I have been told two years. You can’t separate the psychological from the practical – it’s more difficult to help people if they’re preoccupied with survival,” said Palmer-White. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said officials recognised the trauma Ukrainians were facing and stood shoulder-to-shoulder with them. However, beyond having access to NHS care officials did not cite any specific provision to provide newly arrived refugees with trauma support. Prof Cornelius Catona, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the visa delays of several weeks would likely exacerbate mental illness for those already struggling and that the refugee schemes should have included a mechanism for spotting signs of trauma early. Viktoriia Liamets, a Ukrainian child and family therapist who recently arrived in the UK after fleeing the war, said Ukrainians arriving in Britain had multiple and complex traumas to contend with. “People are in shock at leaving behind the place they call home,” said Liamets. “Some have left elderly parents and other family members behind taking only a small backpack with them because they thought they would be returning soon. There are so many layers of trauma that it takes a while to process it. People need to be in a safe environment before they can start to do that. But being in a new country with a new language and no income can make them feel vulnerable. Your whole internal construction becomes unstable.” She said children may be particularly badly affected by fleeing the war to the point where it may even change their personalities. Kirsty McNeill, an executive director at Save the Children UK, said there was a worrying lack of mental health support for the “incredibly traumatised” children arriving from Ukraine. She said: “By definition, these children are traumatised. The speed at which their lives have fallen apart is something that needs specialist support to come to terms with. There are kids that went to school as normal on a Monday and by the weekend they were sitting on the floor of a Romanian gym. Their lives got completely turned around in a week. We’re not seeing any real urgency from the UK government about scaling up specialist mental health support, nor are we seeing very many new caseworkers being recruited.” Prof William Yule, an emeritus professor of applied child psychology at King’s College in London and an expert in child stress and trauma and the needs of refugees, said: “The situation in Ukraine is incredibly complicated. One of the important things to remember there is that the war started in 2014. People might be both bereaved and traumatised if they have seen loved ones being killed.” He said children should be allowed to speak and be listened to if they wanted to talk about the war and added that a lot of expertise had been gained in dealing with the issue of traumatic stress from work done in this area following the war in the former Yugoslavia two decades ago.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia-Ukraine war updates: peace talks harder ‘with each new Bucha’, says Zelenskiy - as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/11/russia-ukraine-war-zelenskiy-says-ukrainian-forces-gradually-pushing-occupiers-away-from-kharkiv-live,2022-05-12T00:29:15Z,UK signs security assurance declarations with Sweden and Finland; Ukraine leader says discovery of atrocities makes peace negotiations harder,"We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine and returning in a few hours to bring you all the latest developments. In the meantime, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things stand as of 3am in Kyiv. Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary. The UK prime minister travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said joining would be to “maximise security” and not be in any way offensive. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. Kyiv said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation. The Kremlin responded that it was up to residents living in region to decide whether they wanted to join Russia, but any decision must have a legal basis. Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Ukraine claimed it has recaptured Pytomnyk, a village north of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. “The occupying forces moved to the defence in order to slow down the pace of the offensive of our troops,” Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest report. “The settlement of Pytomnyk ... was liberated.” Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Gas flows from Russia’s Gazprom to Europe via Ukraine fell by a quarter on Wednesday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. He said the possibility to negotiate “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. The war will end when Ukraine reclaims everything that Russia took from it, Zelenskiy maintained. “The war will end for the Ukrainian people only when we get back what’s ours,” he said in an online address with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media. Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted. Ukraine has proposed to Russia that badly injured defenders in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port of Mariupol be swapped for Russian prisoners of war, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Wednesday. “There is no agreement yet. Negotiations are continuing,” she said in a post on Telegram. Russia has demanded a formal apology from Poland and threatened possible future reprisals after its ambassador was doused with red paint at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw on Monday. The statement by Russia’s foreign ministry came after it summoned the Polish ambassador, Krzysztof Krajewski, to receive its protest. A Chinese former ambassador to Ukraine, Gao Yusheng, has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion. In a speech which was reported on by the Chinese press before quickly being taken down, Gao said Putin’s frequent “violations” of former Soviet states’ territory were “the greatest threat to peace, security and stability in Eurasia”. The wives of two of the last remaining Ukrainian fighters holed up in Mariupol’s steelworks asked Pope Francis to help get soldiers to a third country. One told him: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.” Ukraine has claimed it has recaptured the town of Pytomnyk, north of Kharkiv and about halfway to the Russian border. The occupying forces moved to the defence in order to slow down the pace of the offensive of our troops,” Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest operational report. In the course of successful actions of units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the settlement of Pytomnyk of Kharkiv region was liberated.” “We are having successes in the Kharkiv direction, where we are steadily pushing back the enemy and liberating population centres,” Brigadier General Oleksiy Hromov, Deputy Chief of the Main Operations Directorate of Ukraine’s General Staff added. The war will end when Ukraine reclaims everything that Russia took from it, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has maintained. In an online address with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media, the president said: The war will end for the Ukrainian people only when we get back what’s ours. We do not need too much, because everything needs to be watched, we need only what’s ours. We want to return peace to our state, to our land. We want to get our land back, because our history is tied with it, it is respect for international law. When we return everything ours, we will end this war.” Zelenskiy also noted that the chances of ending the war through diplomacy decrease “every time Russian troops commit heinous crimes against Ukrainians, as happened in Bucha and Mariupol”. Ukraine has said its military has destroyed pontoon bridges that Russian troops were using to cross a river in the eastern Luhansk region. The Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other armoury in the village of Bilohorivka, near the strategic Ukrainian-held city of Lysychansk. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai described Bilohorivka as a “fortress” that - like the city of Mariupol - was “holding back a great number” of Russian troops. Heavy fighting has been raging in the region for days. We have some footage of Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, announcing his country’s possible intention to join Nato. Finland is not yet a member of the intergovernmental military alliance, but Niinistö said joining would be to “maximise security” and not be in any way offensive. Niinistö said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had pushed his government and country to think about its security. Niinistö was speaking at a joint news conference with the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, after signing a new security agreement that would involve Britain providing military assistance if Finland was attacked. Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary. The UK prime minister travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline.

In his nightly address, Zelenskiy celebrated the first US congressional passage of $40bn in aid, as well as the approval of the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act. The package includes $6bn for security assistance, including training, equipment, weapons and support; $8.7bn to replenish stocks of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and $3.9bn for European Command operations. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Guardian staff In his nightly address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy celebrated the first US congressional passage of $40b in aid, as well as the approval of the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act. He said: The House of Representatives of the United States Congress voted for a new and significant package of support for our state and global democracy. Almost $40 billion... These funds will be used as quickly as possible and without bureaucracy to strengthen Ukraine’s defense. First of all, it is weapons and ammunition for us, equipment. But not only that. It is also a support for the investigation of war crimes of the Russian Federation, the occupiers, support for diplomatic work and more. He also celebrated Joe Biden’s final approval of the Ukraine Lend-Lease Act today: People who remember history well know that Lend-Lease was one of the key preconditions for the Allied victory in World War II. Lend-Lease assistance from the United States to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union has dramatically changed the balance of power in Europe. Europeans then received a wide range of products under Lend-Lease - from aircraft to trucks, from aviation fuel to communication means. By the way, American radio stations and other things provided under Lend-Lease worked for the Soviet people long after the war. For decades. Hitler’s Germany, even with all the resources in the occupied territories, could do nothing to counter this potential of the Allies on the basis of American productive capacities. And it is no coincidence that the new Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act was signed on May 9. I am personally grateful to President Biden for this support, for this decision and for such symbolism. Because we are now defending freedom and the right to life for all free nations in the war against tyranny, which poses no less of a threat to Europe than it did 80 years ago. Simply put, Lend-Lease is a scheme to give us everything we need for defense. Although formally it is like a loan, in fact it is so profitable that it is incorrect to call it a loan. When Vladimir Putin stood up to speak at this week’s Victory Day parade in Moscow’s Red Square, there was an expectation – around the world and in Russia – that he would decisively seek to escalate the war in Ukraine towards a conclusion. But as Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth tells Michael Safi, Putin did nothing of the kind. He did not even claim the victories that were available to him – there were no announcements regarding defeated cities in Ukraine now under Russian control. Instead, he spoke of helping the military families who had sacrificed their sons to the conflict. The muted tone of the speech was revealing: it shows, says Roth, that Putin is faced with a dilemma that could make or break his presidency and his legacy in Russia. If he escalates the conflict he stands more chance of winning the kind of victory he initially hoped for. But should that fail, he would face humiliation. Alternatively, he could claim victory now and seek to de-escalate the conflict. But would a limited, compromised declaration of victory be regarded as anything but a retreat? The decision cannot be delayed indefinitely. Russia’s elite fighting units are nearing exhaustion. And the limited “operation” does not yet allow for a full-scale mobilisation. But there is growing recognition in Moscow and elsewhere that Ukraine’s fighters should not be underestimated. Putin does not hold all the aces in this conflict. Listen to the podcast: Final congressional approval of a $40bn Ukraine aid bill in the United States seems certain within days as top US Senate Republicans said Wednesday they expect strong backing from their party for the measure already passed by the House of Representatives, the Associated Press reports. “I think there’ll be substantial support. We’re going to try to process it as soon as possible,” Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky, told the AP about the latest legislation legislation, which cleared the House late Tuesday by an emphatic 368 votes to 57 margin in support of the massive funding package. The No 2 Republican in the Senate, John Thune of South Dakota predicted “a big vote over here” for the bill, which he and others suggested might come Thursday but could spill into next week. Thune said some Republicans would vote against it and procedural tactics by opponents to slow it were possible, but added: I think because there’s so much forward momentum behind doing this and doing it in a timely way that it I don’t think we’ll have anybody who will hold it up.” It’s taken just two weeks for lawmakers to receive president Joe Biden’s smaller, $33bn package, enlarge it and move it to the brink of passage – lightning speed for Congress. That reflects a bipartisan consensus that Ukraine’s outnumbered forces need additional Western help as soon as possible, with added political pressure fueled by near-daily tales of atrocities against civilians inflicted by Russian president Vladimir Putin’s armies. “Act quickly we must,” said Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat of New York. “I will make sure this is a priority for the Senate. We have a moral obligation to stand with our friends in Ukraine.” My west coast colleague Maanvi Singh will now take the blog baton in Oakland, California, and take you through events as they happen. British defence secretary Ben Wallace is talking to reporters about Russia while on a visit to Washington DC. Wallace is also busy dissing Russian weapons. And he claims that China appears to be increasingly embarrassed by Russia’s conduct of its war in Ukraine, with Beijing regarding Moscow as an “inconvenient friend”, according to this FP report. Ben Wallace and Lloyd Austin looking on as a military display takes place at the Pentagon. Strong images continue to emerge from Mariupol of the destruction wrought by occupying Russian forces, which continue to besiege the Azovstal steel complex, where Ukrainian forces are holding out in dire straits. Mariupol Ukraine has proposed to Russia that badly injured defenders in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port of Mariupol be swapped for Russian prisoners of war, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Wednesday, Reuters reports. There is no agreement yet. Negotiations are continuing,” she said in an online post. We’ll bring you more details when we have them. Conditions in the besieged steel works, Ukraine’s last stand in Mariupol, have been appalling both for Ukrainian military coming under heavy fire and attacks from the Russians and Ukrainian civilians hiding and recently evacuated from the huge, labyrinthine complex that has several floors below ground. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he had spoken to German chancellor Olaf Scholz and discussed defensive aid, energy sector cooperation and increasing sanctions on Russia as an invading force, Reuters now reports. The Ukrainian president said the two talked about such matters in relation to “the Russian aggressor”. “We appreciate the high level of dialogue” with Germany, he tweeted, using a German flag emoji to represent the country, and “support in our struggle”. Zelenskiy had previously invited Scholz to make a powerful political statement by visiting Kyiv on 9 May, the day German leaders have often travelled to Moscow to mark Russia’s Victory Day commemoration of the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. That particular visit did not take place and Scholz instead was in Berlin, accompanied by French president Emmanuel Macron, where the Brandenburg Gate was illuminated in the colours of the Ukrainian flag as a mark of support. Reuters notes that Scholz had been reluctant to visit Ukraine since Kyiv was unwilling to receive German president Frank-Walter Steinmeier. Steinmeier is unpopular in Kyiv because he is associated there with an earlier German policy of pursuing close trade and other ties with Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock visited Ukraine yesterday (10 May) as the highest-ranking German government official to visit the country since Russia’s invasion began on 24 February. The US team has taken the blog now and our team in New York and California will keep you updated for the next few hours before we hand over to our colleagues in Australia. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary. The UK prime minister travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. He said the possibility to negotiate “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted. Russia has demanded a formal apology from Poland and threatened possible future reprisals after its ambassador was doused with red paint at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw on Monday. The statement by Russia’s foreign ministry came after it summoned the Polish ambassador, Krzysztof Krajewski, to receive its protest. A Chinese former ambassador to Ukraine, Gao Yusheng, has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion. In a speech which was reported on by the Chinese press before quickly being taken down, Gao said Putin’s frequent “violations” of former Soviet states’ territory were “the greatest threat to peace, security and stability in Eurasia”. The wives of two of the last remaining Ukrainian fighters holed up in Mariupol’s steelworks asked Pope Francis to help get soldiers to a third country. One told him: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.” That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Joanna Walters. I’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you for reading. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. If Russia attempts to annex the Kherson region it would make a peace agreement more unlikely, as Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said that Russia’s withdrawal to prewar positions was a precondition for any successful negotiation. It is not clear whether the Kremlin will go forward with an annexation or is using it as a threat to put pressure on Kyiv. The annexation call was made on Wednesday by Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of the military administration Russia put in place to run Kherson in late April. Russia occupied Kherson in March and seized its city council building in late April. “The city of Kherson is Russia; there will be no the KNR [Kherson People’s Republic] on the territory of the Kherson region, there will be no referendums,” said Stremousov in a televised briefing. It will be a single decree based on the appeal of the leadership of the Kherson region to the president of the Russian Federation, and there will be a request to make [Kherson] into a full-fledged region of the Russian Federation. Stremousov previously said that Kherson would begin using the rouble currency, a move seen as creeping integration into Russia. Russian officials who have visited Kherson have promised not to abandon the region. “Russia is here to stay forever,” said Andrei Turchak, secretary general of Russia’s ruling United Russia party, while visiting Kherson last week. “There should be no doubt about it. There will be no return to the past.” But similar requests for annexation from territories such as the Russian-controlled Donetsk People’s Republic have languished for years, as the Kremlin has dangled integration while seeking to put pressure on Kyiv. Here’s more on Helskini’s decision on whether to apply for Nato membership. A former Finnish prime minister, Alexander Stubb, said Finland is 99.9% likely to join the alliance. Speaking to the BBC, Stubb said the Finnish president will announce the country’s intention to join tomorrow, followed by an announcement over the weekend, and a joint statement from Finland and Sweden early next week. There is “overwhelming support” in Finland for joining Nato, Stubb said, citing a poll earlier this week which showed 76% in favour and 12% against. Stubb, who served as prime minister from 2014 to 2015, said: The only person we can thank is Putin, he’s the reason we’re joining. He said Finland is “not at all” worried about Russia’s threat of “a military-technical response” if it joins the alliance, adding that when Iceland, Denmark and Norway joined in 1949 “the rhetoric was similar”. But he warned that Finland could be vulnerable to Russian intimidation, cyber attacks and disinformation during the “grey zone” of the membership application process. Our Dan Sabbagh writes that in the event of a Russian attack on Britain, Finland would prove a useful military ally. The US does not believe that Vladimir Putin would want to militarily take on the Nato alliance, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, said. Speaking during a congressional hearing, Austin said: As you look at Putin’s calculus, my view - and I’m sure the chairman has his own view - but my view is that Russia doesn’t want to take on the NATO alliance. He added that there are 1.9m forces in Nato, and that “this is a fight that (Putin) doesn’t really want to have”. From Voice of America’s Jeff Seldin: Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, says the Russian invasion of Ukraine has “changed the picture” and “made us think” about its security. Russia has shown it is “ready to attack a neighbouring country”, he said. As a result, Finland is now considering joining Nato. This is not the first time Finland has discussed joining Nato, he says, but Russia has “made it very clear that if you join Nato, they have explained they will do some contra-steps”. At the end of last year, Russia stated that Finland and Sweden cannot join Nato and demanded that Nato does not take new members, he says. Niinisto says: Russia actually expressed that we don’t have our own will here. That is a huge change. That made us think. Addressing Russia directly, Niinisto says: You caused this. Look at the mirror. Finland is already an enhanced partner in Nato and is part of the West, so joining the alliance “would not be that radical”, Niinisto says. Asked whether the declaration will mean British boots on the ground in Finland, Johnson says the agreement is clear: What it says is that in the event of a disaster, or in the event of an attack on either of us, then we will come to each other’s assistance, including with military assistance. The nature of that assistance will “depend on the request of the other party”, Johnson says. The UK prime minister stresses that Nato is a “defensive” alliance, adding: Nato poses no threat to anyone. It is there for the purposes of mutual defence. Boris Johnson has been speaking at a joint news conference with Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, after signing a new security agreement that would involve Britain providing military assistance if Finland is attacked. Niinisto says Finland appreciates the UK’s strong support of Nato’s open-door policy and Finland’s potential to join the alliance. He says joining Nato would “not be against anybody”, adding: We would like to maximise our security in one way or another while thinking about membership in Nato, but it is not a zero sum game. If Finland increases its security, it’s not away from anybody else. Johnson says Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has “brought Finland and the UK even closer together”. Referring to the new signed declaration, Johnson says: From the high north to the Baltics and beyond, our armed forces will train in operational exercises together, marrying our defence and security capabilities and formalising a pledge that we will always come to another’s aid. Boris Johnson is due to speak shortly after a meeting with Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, about the war in Ukraine and European security. You can watch the press conference here on our live blog. I will also be covering the top lines that emerge from the briefing. Nearly a third of jobs in Ukraine - 4.8m in total - have been lost since the Russian invasion, according to the UN. “Economic disruptions, combined with heavy internal displacement and flows of refugees” have caused “large-scale losses in terms of employment and incomes,” the UN’s International Labour Organisation said. In its first report on the consequences of Russia’s war in Ukraine, the ILO praised Kyiv’s efforts to keep Ukraine’s social protection system running. Heinz Koller, the ILO’s Europe and Central Asia regional director, told a press conference: The Ukrainian government is fully operational as well as the employers and the workers’ organisations. We continue to support them in order to be ready to assist them in the current situation, but hopefully also in the reconstruction phase after this conflict is over. The war in Ukraine is fuelling a surge in money transfers to the country as migrant workers and refugees fleeing the conflict scramble to send financial support back to their families. The World Bank said remittances to Ukraine from other countries were expected to rise by more than 20% this year, driven by Ukrainians abroad transferring funds back to friends and family facing the severe economic impact of the Russian invasion. Meanwhile the flow of funds from Russia to countries in central Asia, from where it draws millions of migrant workers, is expected to suffer a dramatic decline as western sanctions plunge Russia into the deepest recession since the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s. Remittances are payments sent from one person to another in a different country, typically by migrant workers sending money back to their families. The World Bank said the surge in cross-border payments to Ukraine mirrored a trend typically seen after natural disasters, as refugees and migrant workers scrambled to support friends and family. The biggest increases came from Poland, the largest recipient of Ukrainian migrant workers, and, to some extent, the US. Undocumented people who travel from the Ukraine to the UK via Ireland could be considered for removal to Rwanda, a senior Home Office official has told MPs. During the same select committee hearing, a minister refused to say under repeated questioning whether Ukrainians who arrive in the UK across the Channel by boat could also be sent to the central African country. The exchanges occurred at the home affairs select committee where the minister, Tom Pursglove, was unable to point to any calculations that the government’s relocation policy would reduce the number of people arriving in the UK in small boats. Some Conservative MPs have criticised Ireland’s decision to lift all restrictions for refugees fleeing war, claiming it would create a back door to the UK, leaving the country vulnerable to potential criminal elements. It has been pointed out that the common travel area means that Ukrainians who do not pass British security checks or are left waiting for visas to arrive could simply reach the UK by travelling to Northern Ireland from the Irish Republic and then getting a ferry to the UK. Stuart C McDonald, the SNP’s home affairs spokesperson and a committee member, asked Dan Hobbs, the director of asylum, protection and enforcement, about Ukrainians crossing into Northern Ireland from Ireland. “Are they within the scope of this policy or are they not?” he said. Hobbs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
replied: “Depending on the individual circumstances they may not fall in the ‘inadmissibility’ criteria.” McDonald said: “You are leaving open the possibility that you can cross from Dublin to Belfast and conceivably end up in Rwanda.” Earlier, Diana Johnson, the chair of the committee, asked Pursglove if Ukrainians who travelled to the UK by small boat would be ruled “inadmissible” and therefore could be removed. Pursglove, the minister for justice and tackling illegal migration, replied: “There is absolutely no reason why any Ukrainian should be getting into a small boat and paying a people smuggler to get into the UK.” If you’ve just joined us, here’s a quick roundup of the key events so far: Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. A senior US military official warned that neither side can win in the present circumstances. The remarks by Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, came as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Russian-backed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said they plan to ask Vladimir Putin to become part of Russia. Kirill Stremousov, the newly appointed deputy head of the military-civilian administration in Kherson, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that the region will be fully governed by Russian law “by the end of the year”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. He said the possibility to negotiate “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he did not see that peace talks over Ukraine taking place in the immediate future. Speaking at a news conference with Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, Guterres also said he was “deeply concerned” about worldwide food shortages as the war in Ukraine threatened food security in different parts of the world. Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed.

I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you the news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. A Chinese former ambassador to Ukraine has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion in a recent speech which was reported on by the Chinese press before quickly being taken down, Helen Davidson and Chi Hui Lin report. Gao Yusheng, who retired over a decade ago after a career spent mostly in Russia and central Asia, told an online Chinese Academy of Social Sciences seminar that Russia’s war is failing. Gao said Moscow under Putin’s rule had never really accepted the sovereignty and independence of former Soviet states, and his frequent “violations” of their territory were “the greatest threat to peace, security and stability in Eurasia”. Gao said: The central and overriding direction of the Putin regime’s foreign policy is to regard the former Soviet Union as its exclusive sphere of influence, and to restore the empire through integration mechanisms in various spheres dominated by Russia. This had been dramatically changed by the Ukraine war, and Gao suggested that once it was over a new world order would likely emerge that saw Ukraine removed from Russia’s “sphere of influence” and brought further into Europe, and Russia’s political, economic, military and diplomatic power drastically weakened and isolated. According to a translation by former US state department official, David Cowhig, Gao said: It can be said that Russia has completely lost Ukraine. At the same time, the former Soviet Union, with the exception of white Russia, including the members of the Collective Security Treaty and the Eurasian Economic Union, have refused to support Russia. Russia’s defeat would leave it with no hope of rebuilding its old empire. Gao’s remarks were reported on by Pheonix News, a Chinese media outlet, but later removed from the internet. An archived copywas available. China’s leader Xi Jinping is a close ally of Putin, and the Chinese Communist Party has refused to condemn the invasion. While Gao is not considered within the CCP’s sphere of influence, analysts suggested his views likely reflected others among the political elite about Xi’s foreign policy regime. Gao was a diplomatic officer to the Soviet Union and then the Russian Federation from 1984-88 and 1992-96. He served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2005-2007 after stints in Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Daniel Boffey and Pjotr Sauer report for us that Ukraine prosecutors are ready to launch the first war crimes trials of the Russian conflict: Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya Tank Division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody, is expected to be the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 18 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. He was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened close to the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74. The case has this week been filed at a criminal court. “He is here [in Ukraine], we have him,” said Venediktova, speaking from her heavily fortified headquarters in Kyiv. A spokesperson added: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Read more of Daniel Boffey and Pjotr Sauer’s report: Ukraine prosecutors ready to launch first war crimes trials of Russia conflict Russia has demanded a formal apology from Poland and threatened possible future reprisals after its ambassador, Sergey Andreev, was doused with red paint at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw on Monday. Russia’s foreign ministry summoned the Polish ambassador, Krzysztof Krajewski, to receive its protest and said in a statement: Russia expects an official apology from the Polish leadership in connection with the incident and demands the safety of the Russian ambassador and all employees of Russian foreign institutions in Poland are ensured. A decision on further steps will be taken depending on Warsaw’s reaction to our demands. Leonid Kravchuk, who has died after a long illness aged 88, was a Communist party bureaucrat who became the first president of independent Ukraine and a main player in bringing the Soviet Union to an ignominious end. At a hastily arranged meeting in a remote hunting lodge in the Belavezha forest in Belarus in December 1991, Kravchuk joined Stanislav Shushkevich, a nuclear physicist who was the leader of Belarus, and Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian Federation, in signing a declaration that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Shushkevich died of Covid-19 a week ago. Yeltsin died in 2007. Kravchuk was the most dynamic and radical of the three men during the fateful discussion. Fearing Russia would continue to try to dominate Ukraine, he told Yeltsin he did not want the Soviet Union to turn itself into a loose confederation. It should be abolished altogether. The three men’s deal had gone ahead without the knowledge of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet president, who was shocked when he heard the news. He had no choice but to resign two weeks later, after accepting that the three Slavic republics, the core entities of the Soviet Union, were no longer loyal to the system. The road to independence had begun in August 1991 when the Ukrainian parliament voted for secession from the Soviet Union a few days after the collapse of an abortive coup by communist hardliners in Moscow to reverse Gorbachev’s democratisation programme. Kravchuk led the Communist party majority in parliament and played a key role in persuading his colleagues to support the opposition’s proposal for independence. The parliament arranged a confirmatory referendum and a presidential election for 1 December. Some 92% of the Ukrainian electorate, including a majority of Ukraine’s ethnic Russians, voted for independence. Kravchuk was chosen as president, a job in which he served until 1994. Read Jonathan Steele’s full obituary of Leonid Kravchuk. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, said he was “deeply concerned” about worldwide food shortages as the war in Ukraine threatened food security in different parts of the world. The war in Ukraine has sent global prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertiliser soaring, with UN agencies warning that the price rises will worsen a food crisis in Africa. It has also disrupted shipping in the Black Sea, a major route for grains and other commodities. Speaking alongside Austria’s chancellor and foreign minister in Vienna, Guterres said: I have to say that I am deeply concerned, namely with the risks of hunger becoming widespread in different parts of the world because of the dramatic food security situation we are facing because of the war in Ukraine. He also said talks were ongoing to evacuate more civilians from conflict zones in Ukraine, but played down the prospects of peace talks between Russia and Ukraine happening anytime soon. A few lines from Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, who said Moscow has enough buyers for its oil and gas outside of western countries, as EU countries try to reduce their reliance on Russian oil and gas. Speaking earlier at a news conference in Muscat, Oman, Lavrov said: Let the west pay more than it used to pay to the Russian Federation, and let it explain to its population why they should become poorer. Lavrov also claimed Russia did not want war in Europe, blaming western countries for “constantly and persistently” saying they wanted to see Russia defeated in Ukraine. Lavrov said: If you are worried about the prospect of war in Europe – we do not want that at all. But I draw your attention to the fact that it is the west that is constantly and persistently saying that in this situation, it is necessary to defeat Russia. Draw your own conclusions. The UK prime minister Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden against potential Russian threats in any way necessary as he travelled to the country to sign a mutual security agreement, with its government considering Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Here is a video clip from his news conference with Swedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson. The pro-Russian self-proclaimed republics of Luhansk and Donetsk in eastern Ukraine have announced that they have blocked access to Facebook and Instagram. This aligns them with Russian policy towards the US social networks. “Access to the information resources of the American company Meta, which allows calls for violence against Russian-speaking users on its social networks, has already been blocked,” the DNR’s communications ministry said in a statement, Reuters reports. “In light of this, access to the Facebook and Instagram social networks is blocked on the republic’s territory.” In a separate statement, the LNR communications ministry said it had also blocked access to the social networks. Russia banned Facebook and Instagram in March after a court found Meta guilty of “extremist activity”. The wives of two of the last remaining Ukrainian fighters holed up in Mariupol’s steelworks asked Pope Francis on Wednesday to help get soldiers to a third country, with one telling him: “Please don’t let them die”. Kateryna Prokopenko,27, and Yuliya Fedosiuk,29, spoke to the pope for about five minutes at the end of his general audience in St Peter’s Square, also asking him to intervene directly with Russian president Vladimir Putin to let the men go because “Russian captivity is not an option”. Reuters reports Prokopenko could be heard telling the pope: “You are our last hope, I hope you can save their lives. Please don’t let them die.” They said they last spoke to their husbands on Tuesday. The men are members of the Azov Regiment, which retains some far-right affiliations. “Our soldiers are waiting to be evacuated to a third country, to lay down their arms in case of evacuation,” Fedosiuk said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. In a virtual address with students at the Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po) in Paris, Zelenskiy said: We are ready to conduct these negotiations, these talks, as long as it is not too late. But, he added: With each new Bucha, with each new Mariupol, with each new city where there are dozens of dead people, cases of rape, with each new atrocity, the desire and the possibility to negotiate disappears, as well as the possibility of resolving this issue in a diplomatic manner. Zelenskiy also said he wanted to restore Ukraine’s territory before an end of the war with Russia could be envisioned, adding: Once we recoup all that is ours, we will finish this. The US ambassador to Russia, John Sullivan, has arrived at Russia’s foreign ministry along with Poland’s ambassador, Krzysztof Krajewski, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria reported. Krajewski had been summoned to the foreign ministry after anti-war protesters doused red liquid over the Russian ambassador to Poland, Sergey Andreev, at a wreath-laying ceremony in Warsaw on Monday, Poland’s state-run news agency Pap reported. Poland’s foreign minister, Zbigniew Rau, was quoted as saying: As far as our relations with the Russian Federation are concerned, we know that the Polish ambassador to Moscow has been summoned to the Russian foreign ministry. He said Polish authorities had warned Andreev that attending the cemetery risked provoking an incident, adding: However, what happened does not in any way change our position that diplomatic representatives of foreign countries are entitled to protection … no matter how much we feel the need to disagree with the policy of the government that the diplomat represents. Russia is not planning to close its embassy in Warsaw “unless the Polish authorities make its functioning impossible”, embassy representatives told Reuters today. In response to Boris Johnson’s visit to Sweden and Finland today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia is closely watching anything that can affect Nato’s configuration on its borders. In his daily briefing with reporters, Peskov also denied an assessment by the US spy chief, Avril Haines, that Russia was preparing for a prolonged war in Ukraine. Instead, Peskov said Russia’s military operation in Ukraine is going according to plan. Britain would support whatever Sweden decides around possible future Nato membership, Boris Johnson says at the joint press conference with Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. The UK prime minister says the security assurance pact with Sweden is a separate conversation from Sweden’s future relationship with Nato, which is “a matter for Sweden”. He says: What we are saying emphatically is that in the event of a disaster or the event of an attack upon Sweden, then the UK would come to the assistance of Sweden with whatever Sweden requested. Johnson adds later: I think there’s a separate issue about Nato, which I think Sweden is going to be addressing in the course of the next few days. That’s not for me to comment upon except of course to say that I’m sure the UK will support whatever course of action Sweden decides to embark upon and will be as useful and supportive as we can. Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, also addressed reporters about the bilateral political declaration of solidarity signed by her and Boris Johnson. Andersson says she and the UK prime minister have “agreed to face challenges in peace, crisis and conflict together”, adding: If either country should suffer a disaster or an attack, the United Kingdom and Sweden will assist each other in a variety of ways. The support would be given on request from the affected country and may include military resources. The agreement serves a “crucial purpose” regardless of the choices Sweden will make in terms of joining Nato, Andersson says. Asked what would Britain do if Sweden was attacked, Johnson replies that when “faced with the obvious threat to liberal democracies”, both countries would “come to each other’s support”, whether in the event of a disaster or military attack. What we’re saying today is that upon request from the other party, we would come to the other party’s assistance. Johnson says the pact is an “important step forward” for the relationship between Sweden and Britain, adding: This is an agreement on which we together intend to build. Whether it’s in sharing intelligence or working together to combat cyber attacks. Whether it’s working together in defence, procurement, or doing more joint exercises together. Boris Johnson has been speaking at a press conference during his visit to Sweden for talks with its prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. Johnson says he will sign a “historic” security assurance declaration with Sweden in the face of “the empty conceit of a 21st-century tyrant”. Johnson said: The war in Ukraine is forcing us all to make difficult decisions, but sovereign nations must be free to make those decisions without fear of influence or threat of retaliation. The agreement will “bring our two countries even closer together”, to share “more intelligence, bolster our military exercises and further our joint development of technology”, Johnson says. He added: Most importantly, this is an agreement that enshrines the values that both Sweden and the UK hold dear, and which we will not hesitate to defend. The “many carcasses of Russian tanks” that litter the streets of Ukraine are “thanks to Swedish-developed and British-built NLAWs [next generation light anti-tank weapons]” that prove how effective cooperation can be, Johnson adds. Russian-backed authorities in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region said they plan to ask Vladimir Putin to become part of Russia. Kirill Stremousov, the newly appointed deputy head of the military-civilian administration in Kherson, was quoted by Russian news agencies as saying: There will be a request to make Kherson region a full subject of the Russian Federation. He said Kherson will be fully governed by Russian law “by the end of the year”, Russian media reported. In response, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said it was up to residents of Kherson to decide whether they wanted to join Russia, adding that the decision must have a clear legal basis. The Kherson region is located just north of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014. Kherson was the first major Ukrainian city to fall to Russian forces after Putin ordered the invasion on 24 February this year. In April, Russia said it had gained full control of the Kherson region, which is strategically important as it provides part of the land link between the Crimea peninsula and Russian-backed separatist areas in the east of Ukraine. The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said the time would come when there will be peace talks over Ukraine, but that he did not see that they would take place in the immediate future. Speaking at a news conference with Austria’s president, Alexander Van der Bellen, Guterres said: This war will not last forever. There will be a time when peace negotiations will take place. I do not see that in the immediate future. But I can say one thing. We will never give up. The leader of the punk collective Pussy Riot said she fled Russia after disguising herself as a food delivery courier to escape police, joining thousands of Russians who have left the country since Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine. Maria Alyokhina, a longtime critic of the Russian president, was sentenced last September to one year restricted movement while protesting in support of the jailed Kremlin critic, Alexei Navalny. In April, authorities moved to convert her sentence into real jail time. In an interview with the New York Times, Alyokhina,33, described how was able to evade the Moscow police who were monitoring her movements by dressing up as a food delivery courier and leaving her mobile phone behind so she couldn’t be tracked. She said a friend drove her to the Belarussian border and a week later managed to cross into Lithuania, with the help of an Icelandic artist who secured her travel documents from a European country. Alyokhina compared her experience to a “spy novel”, saying: I was happy that I made it, because it was an unpredictable and big ‘kiss-off’ to the Russian authorities. Her partner and fellow Pussy Riot member, Lyusya Shtein, shared a photo of Alyokhina, dressed in a green Delivery Club uniform and wearing a food delivery backpack. Shtein tweeted that Alyokhina “did not flee Russia, she has gone on tour” to raise money for Ukraine, beginning with a concert in Berlin on 12 May. Shtein had also been sentenced to restricted movement for protesting against the imprisonment of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny but in April she fled Russia, posting a video of herself cutting off a police anklet monitor. She also used the food delivery disguise to escape Russia, the New York Times said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has thanked the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and members of the House of Representatives for approving a bill in which Washington would deliver $40bn-worth of aid to Ukraine amid Russia’s ongoing invasion. The Democratic-led House voted 368-57 on Tuesday evening to pass the bill, with all 57 votes in opposition from Republican members. The measure will need to be passed by the Senate before going to the president, Joe Biden, to be signed into law. The UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, has arrived in Sweden for the start of a trip where he will also visit Finland to discuss the Nordic countries’ ambitions to apply for Nato membership. Johnson is scheduled to meet leaders of both countries during his 24-hour trip, where he will also be discussing Europe’s response to the war in Ukraine. Downing Street said the visit to Stockholm and Helsinki was also about the “security of Europe more broadly”, adding: We understand the positions of Sweden and Finland and that is why the prime minister is going to discuss these broader security issues. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, is expected to announce on Thursday his stance on joining Nato, a move that would mean a major shift in security policy for the country. An announcement is also expected from Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats on Sunday following consultations over the weekend. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was “technologically impossible” to shift all volumes to the Sudzha interconnection point further west, as GTSOU proposed. A series of photos published on the Azov Regiment’s Telegram channel early this morning purport to show the squalid conditions of wounded Ukrainian defenders holed up under the Azovstal steelworks plant in besieged Mariupol. Ukrainian forces have retaken villages in the Kharkiv region, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his nightly address. The liberation of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske could signal a new phase in the war, Zelenskiy said, while cautioning against expecting “certain victories”. The Russian armed forces claim that overnight they hit 93 objects, including two command posts and three ammunition depots of the Ukrainian army. As a result of the strikes, they say, more than 280 nationalists were killed and 59 units of military equipment were disabled. Ukraine’s army claims that in the Donetsk and Luhansk oblast “defenders of Ukraine repulsed 12 enemy attacks, destroyed 12 tanks, four artillery systems, 19 units of armoured combat vehicles, seven cars and two units of special engineering equipment of the enemy”. Ukraine also accused Russia of using “electronic warfare systems to suppress radio channels”. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, said the north-eastern region of Ukraine was “relatively quiet”, but warned citizens: “It is dangerous to return to the recently liberated settlements. The enemy completely mined everything, including schools, kindergartens and private homes.” Russia could dominate the north-western Black Sea if it is able to consolidates its position on Snake Island, according to the the UK Ministry of Defence. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the US of waging a “proxy war” against Russia after the House of Representatives approved a $40bn aid package for Ukraine. Russia’s State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin has accused Washington of using the aid package to “indebt” Ukraine and of appropriating the country’s grain reserves in lieu of payment. The European Union’s proposal on oil sanctions against Russia would destroy the Hungarian economy and does not offer a solution to the huge problems it would create for the country, foreign minister Péter Szijjártó said. That is it from me, Martin Belam in London for now. Léonie Chao-Fong will be with you shortly. I will be back later. Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has accused the US of waging a “proxy war” against Russia after the House of Representatives approved a $40bn aid package for Ukraine [see 6.33am]. Writing on the messenger app Telegram, Medvedev said the US economy would suffer, and that the bill approved by the House on Tuesday was a bid “to deal a serious defeat to our country and limit its economic development and political influence in the world”. Reuters reports Medvedev said: “It won’t work. The printing press by which America is constantly increasing its already inflated government debt will break faster.” Medvedev, who has served as deputy chairman of Russia’s security council since resigning as prime minister in January 2020, is a loyal supporter of Vladimir Putin. He blamed price rises for US fuel and groceries on what he called America’s “Russophobic authorities”. Also writing on Telegram, Russia’s State Duma speaker Vyacheslav Volodin accused Washington of using the aid package to “indebt” Ukraine and of appropriating the country*s grain reserves in lieu of payment. “Washington wants a Holodomor in Ukraine,” he wrote, referring to the man-made 1930s famine that killed millions of Ukrainians when it was part of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has posted an update on the situation in the north-eastern city. He says in an update on Telegram: Thanks to the successful actions of the armed forces and the liberation of a number of settlements in Kharkiv, it is now relatively quiet. Still it is impossible to lose vigilance. You need to be very careful and not be on the street unnecessarily. It is also dangerous to return to the recently liberated settlements. The enemy completely mined everything, including schools, kindergartens and private homes. Currently, special services are conducting demining. Critical infrastructure is also being restored, primarily gas and electricity. Electricity supply has already been partially restored in Kharkiv districts. At the same time, all the war crimes of the occupiers are recorded, which prove the inhuman nature of the enemy. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine today. The European Union’s proposal on oil sanctions against Russia would destroy the Hungarian economy and does not offer a solution to the huge problems it would create for Hungary, foreign minister Péter Szijjártó said. Reuters reports he said in a video on his Facebook page that after talks conducted so far, the European Commission does not have a solution, so the only way to an agreement on an oil embargo would be if it applied to maritime oil shipments, and all shipments of Russian oil via pipelines would be fully exempted. The Russian armed forces have issued their daily bulletin. They claim that: During the night they hit 93 objects, including two command posts and three ammunition depots of the Ukrainian army. As a result of the strikes, more than 280 nationalists were killed and 59 units of military equipment were disabled. Air defence systems destroyed nine Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles at night. The claims have not been independently verified. Our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour tweets about the level of support for joining Nato in Sweden, ahead of the visit of the UK’s prime minister Boris Johnson today. Two points of note from the operational update of the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces this morning. They claimed: In the Donetsk and Luhansk oblast, defenders of Ukraine repulsed 12 enemy attacks, destroyed 12 tanks, four artillery systems, 19 units of armoured combat vehicles, seven cars and two units of special engineering equipment of the enemy. They also suggested that the “Russian enemy uses electronic warfare systems to suppress radio channels”. The claims have not been independently verified. Ukraine’s state emergency services have updated the figure for the number of explosives and munitions they have dealt with. They posted to their Telegram channel that since Russia’s latest invasion began on 24 February, they have dealt with a total of 102,676 explosive devices, including 1,967 aircraft bombs. The claim has not been independently verified. Russia’s news agency RIA is carrying quotes from Apta Alaudinov, assistant to the head of Chechnya, claiming that the remnants of the Ukrainian troops driven out of the city of Rubizhne in the Donbas are blocked at the Zarya plant. It quotes him saying: All these days we have been busy blocking the Zarya plant. We had the task of clearing it from the left flank of the Zarya plant to Kudryashovka from those strongholds and points that were there, so as not to leave the enemy behind us. This task has already been completed, our forces and means have practically blocked the Zarya plant. Rubizhne is in the Luhansk region to the east of Ukraine. Zarya is a chemical plant. This is Martin Belam in London on the live blog. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com A series of photos published on the Azov Regiment’s Telegram channel early this morning purport to show the squalid conditions of wounded Ukrainian defenders holed up under the Azovstal steelworks plant in besieged Mariupol. The harrowing images reveal the horror of a dimly lit, makeshift ‘hospital’ inside the plant where soldiers receive treatment, many for lost limbs. The photos were published alongside a statement pleading for help. The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act! In completely unsanitary conditions, with open wounds bandaged with non-sterile remnants of bandages, without the necessary medication and even food. We call on the UN and the Red Cross to show their humanity and reaffirm the basic principles on which you were created by rescuing wounded people who are no longer combatants. The servicemen you see in the photo and hundreds more at the Azovstal plant defended Ukraine and the entire civilised world with serious injuries at the cost of their own health. Are Ukraine and the world community now unable to protect and take care of them?” The regiment pleaded for the “immediate evacuation of wounded servicemen to Ukrainian-controlled territories” where they could be assisted and provided with proper care. The US House of Representatives has approved more than $40bn in aid for Ukraine. The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57 on Tuesday evening, with every “no” vote coming from Republicans, according to a Reuters report. The measure now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act quickly. President Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine two weeks ago, but lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. “This bill will protect democracy, limit Russian aggression, and strengthen our own national security, while, most importantly, supporting Ukraine,” Democratic representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs the House appropriations committee, said. Some Republicans opposed the bill, criticising Democrats for moving too quickly to send too many US taxpayer dollars abroad. Biden’s fellow Democrats narrowly control Congress, but the bill will need Republican votes to get through the Senate. The package includes $6bn for security assistance, including training, equipment, weapons and support; $8.7bn to replenish stocks of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and $3.9bn for European Command operations. In addition, the legislation authorises a further $11bn in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Biden had asked for $5bn. It also authorises $4bn in foreign military financing to provide support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the crisis. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere. Ukraine has remained a major transit route for Russian gas to Europe even throughout Russia’s war in Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reports. But Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was “technologically impossible” to shift all volumes to the Sudzha interconnection point further west, as GTSOU proposed. GTSOU CEO Sergiy Makogon told Reuters that Russian occupying forces had started taking gas transiting through Ukraine and sending it to two Russia-backed separatist regions in the country’s east. He did not cite evidence. The company said it could not operate at the Novopskov gas compressor station due to “the interference of the occupying forces in technical processes”, adding it could temporarily shift the affected flow to the Sudzha physical interconnection point located in territory controlled by Ukraine. Ukraine’s suspension of Russian natural gas flows through the Sokhranivka route should not have an impact on the domestic Ukrainian market, state energy firm Naftogaz head Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters. The state gas company in Moldova, a small nation on Ukraine’s western border, said it had not received any notice from GTSOU or Gazprom that supplies would be interrupted. Russia could dominate the north-western Black Sea if it is able to consolidates its position on Snake Island, according to the the UK ministry of defence. The report, released just after 6am this morning, reads: Fighting continues at Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, with Russia repeatedly trying to reinforce its exposed garrison located there. Ukraine has successfully struck Russian air defences and resupply vessels with Bayraktar drones. Russia’s resupply vessels have minimum protection in the western Black Sea, following the Russian Navy’s retreat to Crimea after the loss of the Moskva. Russia’s current efforts to augment its forces on Zmiinyi Island offer Ukraine more opportunities to engage Russian troops and attrit materiel. If Russia consolidates its position on Zmiinyi Island with strategic air defence and coastal defence cruise missiles, they could dominate the north-western Black Sea.” In case you missed this slightly uplifting news from earlier, Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision Song Contest. At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra thanked everyone for supporting their country amid the Russian invasion. The group had been unable to meet and rehearse regularly and were only able to get together about six weeks before Tuesday night’s performance. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who was commentating for the BBC coverage of the semi-final, said: “Frontman Oleg joked that he doesn’t think the lack of rehearsal time will affect their performance because they’re very attractive men.” The Ukrainian act is the favourite to win. The competition’s producers previously announced Russia will no longer participate in this year’s contest following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine earlier announced its forces have recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pressing a counter-offensive that could signal a shift in the war’s momentum and jeopardise Russia’s main advance. Tetiana Apatchenko, press officer for the 92nd Separate Mechanised Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, in the country’s east, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Defence ministry adviser Yuriy Saks said the successes were pushing Russian forces out of range of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and located in the north-east, which has been under perpetual bombardment since the war began. The military operations of the Ukrainian armed forces around Kharkiv, especially north and north-east of Kharkiv, are sort of a success story. The Ukrainian army was able to push these war criminals to a line beyond the reach of their artillery.” Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy also confirmed the news during his national address, though he cautioned against expecting “certain victories”. The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn’t create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. The counterattack near Kharkiv could signal a new phase, with Ukraine now going on the offensive after weeks in which Russia mounted a massive assault without making a breakthrough. By pushing back Russian forces who had occupied the outskirts of Kharkiv since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainians are moving into striking distance of the rear supply lines sustaining the main Russian attack force further south. Neil Melvin of the RUSI think tank in London said: They’re trying to cut in and behind the Russians to cut off the supply lines, because that’s really one of their (the Russians’) main weaknesses. Ukrainians are getting close to the Russian border. So all the gains that the Russians made in the early days in the noerth-east of Ukraine are increasingly slipping away.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague Martin Belam in London takes the reins a little later. It is just after 8am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukrainian forces have retaken villages in the Kharkiv region, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his nightly address. The liberation of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske could signal a new phase in the war, Zelenskiy said, while cautioning against expecting “certain victories”. Belarus has said it will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles and warned Belarus could “inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy”. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381 as well as 3,680 injured. At least 100 civilians remained in the Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor said. Ukraine’s Azov Regiment made a plea to the international community for help, saying its soldiers were trapped in “completely unsanitary conditions, with open wounds” and without necessary medication or food. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday as they consider whether to apply for Nato membership. Downing Street said they would discuss “broader security issues”. Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a five-storey building that was destroyed in March in Izium, about 120km (75 miles) from Kharkiv. US lawmakers in the House of Representatives have approved more than $40bn more aid for Ukraine. The legislation was due to go the US Senate with hopes high for its passage. Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the US director of national intelligence has said. Avril Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. The UN general assembly has voted overwhelmingly for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the top human rights body. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via Sokhranivka from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reported. Russia’s Gazprom said this would be “technologically impossible”. Four Russian regional governors reportedly resigned on Tuesday as the country braces for the impact of economic sanctions. The heads of the Tomsk, Saratov, Kirov and Mari El regions announced their immediate departure from office, while the head of Ryazan region said he would not run for another term. Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision song contest. At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group Kalush Orchestra thanked viewers for supporting Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. The number of Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion on 24 February is approaching six million," according to the United Nations.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the invasion of Ukraine to weapons procurement: the war games seeking solutions to real-life conflicts,https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/may/27/from-the-invasion-of-ukraine-to-weapons-procurement-the-war-games-seeking-solutions-to-real-life-conflicts,2022-05-27T08:50:30Z,"At King’s College London, students are designing games that explore diplomacy, drones and the psychological impact of battle. But can they really help?","On the second floor of the stately King’s College London building on the Strand, Vladimir Putin, Emmanuel Macron, Olaf Scholz and Joe Biden are sitting around a table studying a map of Ukraine. They are here to negotiate the future of the country, but they all have ulterior objectives too. Germany wants to ensure the safe transit of refugees; the US wants Russia to cease its disinformation campaign; France wants trade; and Russia needs dozens of sanctions to be lifted. But nobody is giving anything away. It’s tense as hell and the clock is ticking. This is not real, of course, it’s just a game – but it’s a game with serious intentions. Today, the heads of state are being played by four people attending an event organised by the university’s department of war studies. Several students who have taken an MA module entitled Designing Wargames for Education &amp; Analysis are showing games they have created to a select crowd of wargaming professionals, members of the military and representatives of a few big corporations. Wargaming is essentially the competitive simulation of conflict, usually on some sort of map board with a variety of playing pieces. Chess can be understood as a heavily abstracted version, but there are detailed, complex games based on everything from the unification of Japan (Sekigahara) to apocalyptic sci-fi combat (Warhammer 40,000). Wargames have also been used extensively by military forces for about 200 years in order to plan real-life campaigns and role-play possible outcomes. The UK’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) has a dedicated Defence Wargaming Centre near Portsmouth, while the US Marine Corps is currently building a Wargaming and Analysis Center at its base in Quantico, Virginia. One of those attending is an expert from the MoD who assures me the Ukraine invasion has been heavily war-gamed by both Nato and Russian military planners. Indeed, a report published by the Royal United Services Institute in February claimed that Russian forces ran wargames preceding the invasion in order to plan an attack on Ukraine’s infrastructure using assets within the country. The Ukraine game here today is called War and Change and it’s being demoed by co-designer Sacha Nacouzi, currently studying for an MA in international security. The main aim for the western countries is to get Russia out of Ukraine, but each country also has to secure its own interests in the region. Meanwhile the player representing Russia must seek to end sanctions, reopen trade routes and get back on the Swift financial system. The action is separated into a series of 10 five-minute rounds, in which players negotiate, swap asset cards and work out mini deals. It’s more like a fantasy role-playing game, especially as Nacouzi encourages players to mimic the personalities and policies of the leaders they are portraying. When I take part, I get stuck with Donald Trump, who is voted back in to power early in the game. I decide this means I should seek to grab the most valuable Ukrainian territories back from Russia so that I can look like a tough guy, while also reopening US airspace to Russian craft and unfreezing the assets of oligarchs so I can suck up to my pal Putin. “The game is designed to provide a holistic overview of issues considered in territorial negotiations,” says Nacouzi, who created it with fellow students Pelle Padmos, Josh Lebowtiz and Lilla Douchahe. “This includes the strategic placements of regions, borders, trade agreements, agrifood exports, economic sanctions, gas and oil.” Her hope is that players come away with a better understanding of the assets countries have at their disposal and the kinds of liabilities they face in complex negotiations. On a table beside War and Change, another group is playing Guns N’ Money, a game about weapons procurement. Nearby there’s Shooting Daedalus, about the tactics of modern urban combat. What is interesting about these games is that the students don’t come from the professional wargame sector, so they’re unencumbered by conventional thinking and design rules. “It’s precisely because the students don’t have a professional background that they have a way of thinking of questions or ideas that you wouldn’t otherwise see,” says the event’s organiser, David Banks, a wargaming lecturer and academic director of the Wargaming Network at King’s College London. “One of the designers of the game about urban warfare was an architect – he’s really interested in the use of space. The diversity of life experiences on this course really helps. They don’t fall back on things they’ve learned or played.” The next game I play illustrates this pretty clearly. Called Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone, it’s a simulation of drone warfare involving two players, one taking part as a drone pilot, the other as their commanding officer. In each round a possible target is identified on the board, which represents a satellite image, and the CO gives the pilot the command to strike. The pilot needs to follow that order or play an action card to question the directive. Each square on the board has a number relating to how many civilians may be killed if an attack goes ahead. Some of the actions are “signature strikes”, where the drone spots someone who looks like, or is behaving like, a known enemy target but their identity is not confirmed. The outcome of each strike is decided by the roll of the dice and if things go wrong, the pilot could be responsible for civilian casualties. When this happens, the player loses moral points, and they need to draw cards that show photographs of their victims. Repeated failures lead to increasing mental health difficulties and eventually incapacitating depression. It is uncommon for wargames to model psychological outcomes, and I ask the game’s lead designer, Edward McEvoy, if there has been interest from those attending. “Yes,” he says. “Some of the experts we’ve spoken to today think that games that explore the human aspects of war and conflict could give new perspectives that may change certain policies. Perhaps they’ll even lead to less conflict.” Wargames aren’t employed only by the military. Corporations use them to explore business decisions; government policymakers use them to simulate major events, including pandemics; and they have a role in disaster relief. “The UNHCR has made efforts in various cities to help with the influx of Ukrainian refugees and provide relief to civic centres and to other spaces housing many people and aid workers,” says Lily Boland, co-designer of Don’t Fear the Reaper Drone. “Wargaming and/or simulating some of these crucial aspects of refugee aid work would certainly help organisations like the UN and local institutions to prepare for these scenarios in advance.” What the situation in Ukraine has shown the world is that the outcomes of military action are becoming less predictable. Russia’s command and control strategy has been found wanting, while Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s innovative and playful use of social media has increased awareness and support for his country in a way that would have been tough to forecast. As Banks puts it, “I’m a huge believer in using historical case studies as much as possible, but a lot of the problems we’re facing in the 21st century are not ones that we have any ready guides for.” As the world becomes ever more unpredictable and prone to disruptive global events, perhaps new strategies and solutions will be discovered in games like these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Europe’s growth forecast cut as Ukraine war drives up inflation; diesel price hits record – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2022/may/16/china-economic-activity-falls-stock-markets-recession-ftse-eurozone-growth-inflation-bank-of-england-business-live,2022-05-16T14:31:23Z,Rolling coverage of the latest economic and financial news,"Time for a recap Concerns over the global economic recovery have continued to mount, after China’s economic activity plummeted, and eurozone growth forecasts were cut. China’s retail sales tumbled by over 11% in April, while industrial production contracted by 2.9% -- both the worst readings since the early months of the pandemic in 2020. Unemployment rose, while property sales saw their biggest slump since August 2006. Analysts warned that China’s economy could shrink this quarter, as Covid-19 lockdowns continued to hit consumer spending and factory output. The EC has slashed its forecasts for European growth, as the Ukraine war disrupts supply chain and drive up energy commodity costs. It now expects the eurozone to only expand by 2.7% this year, from 4.0% previously. Portugal is expected to record the fastest growth in the EU this year, at 5.8%, followed by Ireland with 5.4%. The weakest growth is seen in Estonia, with just 1%, followed by Germany and Finland with 1.6% each. Inflation is expected to average 6.1% this year, three times the ECB’s target, having hit record highs of 7.5% last month. That will mean a serious cost of living squeeze for European households, as we’re also seeing in the UK. EC vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said the Ukraine war was hurting economic growth: There is no doubt that the EU economy is going through a challenging period due to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and we have downgraded our forecast accordingly. The overwhelming negative factor is the surge in energy prices, driving inflation to record highs and putting a strain on European businesses and households. While growth will continue this year and next, it will be much more subdued than previously expected. Uncertainty and risks to the outlook will remain high as long as Russia’s aggression continue Soaring energy prices have also pushed the eurozone into a record trade deficit, and widened its trade gap with Russia. In the UK, the diesel price hit a new record high over £1.80, and fuel prices could keep rising if the EU ban on Russian oil goes ahead. Greenpeace said its protesters have occupied a jetty where a tanker carrying a 33,000-tonne shipment of Russian diesel was due to berth, forcing it to turn around in the Thames, in an attempt to stop fossil fuel sales funding the Ukraine invasion. McDonald’s started the process of selling its business in Russia after 30 years of operating its restaurants in the country, following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The fast food operator said the humanitarian crisis caused by Russia’s invasion and the unpredictable operating environment meant continuing operating in Russia was untenable as it was no longer “consistent with McDonald’s values”. Ofgem has outlined plans to change the UK’s energy price cap every three months -- leading analyst to warn that bills could jump in both this October and next January. In other news... A group of 58 leading economists and politicians, including the former business minister Vince Cable, has written to the chancellor to say that scaling back City regulation will put the UK at risk of another financial crash. London mayor Sadiq Khan has said the capital is “desperate” for commuters to return and needs to keep investing to lure them back, as he reopened the Northern line via Bank station, a key connection into the City. Administrators for the collapsed rent-to-own firm BrightHouse, which specialised in loans for big-ticket items such as fridges and sofas, have warned they will not have enough money to compensate thousands of customers who were left with unaffordable debts. Greggs has revealed its sales in large cities and locations near offices are lagging behind those elsewhere in the country amid the shift to working from home. Ryanair warned of a “fragile” recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a €355m loss for the financial year. Lifestyle brand Made.com has slashed its sales forecasts and issued a profits warning, warning that the market is much weaker than forecast. Stocks have dipped on Wall Street, as recession fears continue to weigh on markets. But in London, the FTSE 100 has shrugged off earlier losses to be up 36 points, or 0.5%, at 7455 in late trading. And the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has told MPs that the UK economy has experienced an “almost unprecedented” run of shocks, with the Ukraine war coming on top of Covid We can’t predict things like wars ... that’s not really in our remit. Andrew Bailey, governor of the Bank of England, has started to give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about the risk of a recession. He’s appearing amid growing criticism from government benches about the UK’s soaring inflation rate (which hit 7% in March, even before energy bills soared in April). Bailey has begun by telling MPs that he’s not at all happy that inflation is overshooting the Bank’s 2% targets, and that most of the overshoot is due to energy and tradeable goods prices. He argues that the Bank couldn’t reasonably have done anything differently regarding monetary policy (critics say it should have raised interest rates sooner....) Our Politics Live blog will be tracking the main developments: London is “desperate” for commuters to return and needs to keep investing to lure them back, its mayor, Sadiq Khan, has said as he reopened the Northern line via Bank station, a key connection into the City. Khan said the reopening was another milestone on the road to recovery after Covid. The underground branch had been closed for 17 weeks to build a new tunnel, track and concourse to alleviate congestion in the station, a key interchange for tube lines and the Docklands Light Railway. The commissioner for Transport for London, Andy Byford, said it had been completed “on time and on budget” – a critical point for TfL as it seeks to negotiate long-term capital funding for investment from the government. The full £700m Bank upgrade project, encompassing six years of work on the station and including better connections, accessible lifts, and a new station entrance, will be completed later this year. Khan said the reopening of “one of the most complicated stations in the world” was “another example of investment in public transport paying dividends, that will lead to an improved experience for commuters – we’re desperate to get people back to the office. “This is crucial. If you’ve been working from home for the last two years, we’ve got to make the offer of returning to the office – the journey – enticing.” Wall Street has opened in the red, as news that China’s economic activity weakened in April add to concerns about a global economic slowdown. Investors are also still concerned that the Federal Reserve will tighten policy sharply this year, given mounting concerns over inflation (as we’ve just heard from NY Fed chief John Williams). The S&amp;P 500 index of US stocks dipped by 33 points, or 0.8%, to 3,990 points, back towards the bear-market territory it flirted with last week, before a strong rally on Friday. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite has dropped around 1% to 11,667 points. Raffi Boyadjian, lead investment analyst at XM, says recession fears have risen after last month’s slump in activity in China: Fresh jitters about recessionary risks dented sentiment on Monday, weighing on stocks, oil and risky currencies, following some disappointing data out of China that greeted investors at the start of the week’s trading. Industrial production in the world’s second largest economy unexpectedly fell by 2.9% in the 12 months to April, while retail sales plunged by 11.1%, missing the forecasts by a wide margin. Although investors were already expecting a significant hit to China’s economy from the lockdowns, the extent of the contraction has shaken confidence as the global growth outlook keeps deteriorating amid central banks’ battle against inflationary forces. China does not have the same inflation problem as the rest of the world but authorities’ efforts to stimulate the economy have left a lot to be desired. New York Fed President John Williams, a member of the FOMC committee which sets US interest rates, has said inflation is far too high and persistently so, Reuters reports: Williams has also said the inflation is the number one issue for the Fed (CPI hit a 40-year high last month), and that it makes sense to keep raising interest rates by 50 basis points to control it. [The Fed made its first 50bp hike in two decades earlier this month]. Back in the UK, the Green party aren’t impressed by Ofgem’s plan to change Britain’s energy price cap every three months. Co-leader of the Green Party, Adrian Ramsay, said updating the cap twice as often won’t address the cost of living crisis: “Changing the goalposts in this way will do nothing to help the millions of households struggling to put food on the table and pay eye-watering energy bills. Energy companies may think that such tinkering will mitigate the cost-of-living crisis, but they’re not fooling anyone. “We need measures that put money back in people’s pockets now. That’s why the Green Party has argued for restoring the £20 uplift to Universal Credit and doubling it to £40 per week, in addition to other benefits. We also want to provide every household with an additional £320 to help them pay for spiralling energy costs. And in the longer term, a nationwide insulation programme over the next decade funded by a carbon tax on fossil fuel companeis would help cut energy bills “dramatically”, Ramsey adds. Manufacturing activity declined in New York State declined this month, in another worrying sign of economic slowdown. The New York Fed’s Empire State business conditions index, a gauge of manufacturing activity in the state, fell to minus 11.6 this month, down from +24.6 in April. Economists had expected the index to fall slightly to around +16.5, so this shows that conditions deteriorated. Twenty percent of respondents reported that conditions had improved over the month, while thirty-two percent reported that conditions had worsened. Firms reported that new orders declined sharply this month, while shipments fell at the fastest pace since early in the pandemic. Growth in unfilled orders slowed too. The consumer champion Martin Lewis has apologised after swearing at Great Britain’s energy regulator over changes to its price cap on bills. As flagged earlier, Ofgem has confirmed it is planning to update the energy price cap four times a year from October to allow it and consumers to adjust more quickly to volatile markets. Lewis, the founder of the consumer advice site MoneySavingExpert, apologised after swearing on a press call with the regulator regarding the changes. He accused Ofgem of selling consumers “down the river” and wants it to do more to tackle the energy crisis. He said: “I finished the call by asking it to at least consider cutting standard charges, which huge rates stop people really saving by cutting energy use.” Lewis later said he had had “good meetings” with Ofgem and apologised again for the “emotional rant”. Lewis is concerned that Ofgem will require suppliers to pay a market stabilisation charge when acquiring new customers, if wholesale prices fall below a set threshold. That will kill hopes of firms launching cheaper, fixed-term deals, if energy prices fall, he warns: I missed this earlier.. but inflation pressures have continued to rise in Germany. The prices charged by German wholesalers rose by another 2.1% in April, lifting annual wholesale price inflation to 23.8%. That’s the highest since the data series began in 1962, as wholesalers passed on rising costs. Destatis says the Ukraine war continued to push up the cost of raw materials, energy sources and food products. The high annual rate of change for wholesale prices mainly derives from increased prices for raw materials and intermediate products. The largest impact on the annual rate of change in April 2022 had the price increase in wholesale trade of mineral oil products (+63.4%). The high price increase in wholesale trade of solid fuels (+70.9%), grain, unmanufactured tobacco, seeds etc. (+56.3%) as well as metals and metal ores (+55.7%) also contributed to the high rate of change in March 2022. The average price of a litre of diesel has hit a high of just over £1.80 a litre – and could rise even further if the EU ban on Russian oil goes ahead. The RAC reported that the price a litre in the UK has outstripped the previous record of £1.79, set in March after Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. The amount paid on forecourts had dipped in the interim but began rising again in recent weeks as efforts to hit the Kremlin economically fed through into already high fuel prices. A full EU ban on Russian energy imports could push this even higher. High diesel prices are a warning sign for the economy as the fuel is typically used in vans and lorries owned by businesses, driving up their costs. The RAC said petrol prices were also rising – up 3p since the start of the month at 166.65p on average, a penny shy of the record high set in March. More here: Greenpeace says protesters have occupied a jetty where a tanker carrying a 33,000-tonne shipment of Russian diesel was due to berth, forcing it to turn around in the Thames. The campaign group said 12 activists gained access to Navigator Terminals in Grays in Essex and climbed onto the jetty late on Sunday. Greenpeace is protesting against the UK Government allowing fossil fuel money to flow to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Essex Police said officers were called to reports of people gaining access to the terminal shortly after 11.05pm on Sunday, PA Media reports. The force said eight people have been arrested on suspicion of aggravated trespass, and officers are working with partners to bring “a number of others” to safety. Greenpeace said several protesters remain in place, with one activist on the offloading pipes, another hanging off the jetty and others occupying the jetty preventing the tanker from docking. They have unfurled a banner reading: “Oil fuels war”. Greenpeace said the 183-metre-long vessel was due to offload at 11.59pm on Sunday. Georgia Whitaker, oil and gas campaigner at Greenpeace UK, said: “The UK’s attachment to fossil fuels has backfired in the worst way possible - we’re funding a war, our energy bills and fuel costs are sky-high, and we’re driving the climate crisis. “It has to stop. “Putin invaded Ukraine nearly three months ago, and yet fossil fuel money from the UK is still funding his war chest. “Ministers have kicked a ban on Russian oil imports to the end of the year despite strong public support for it. “To stand up to Putin, bring bills down and tackle climate change, the Prime Minister must get us off fossil fuels as fast as possible, stop ludicrous energy waste from our substandard draughty homes, and prioritise cheap, clean, homegrown renewable power.” McDonald’s has started the process of selling its business in Russia after 30 years of operating its restaurants in the country, following Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. In March, McDonald’s closed all its restaurants in Russia including its site in Pushkin Square in the capital, which was the first in the country. As part of the exit, the company expects to record a non-cash charge of about $1.2bn (£980m) to $1.4bn. McDonald’s said. “The humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine, and the precipitating unpredictable operating environment, have led McDonald’s to conclude that continued ownership of the business in Russia is no longer tenable.” UK diesel prices have hit record highs, pushing up the costs faced by some firms and motorists. The RAC reports that the average price of a litre of diesel has hit a new record high at 180.29p. Petrol prices are also close to March’s record levels, as the cost of living squeeze continues to put pressure on households and businesses. RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams said: Efforts to move away from importing Russian diesel have led to a tightening of supply and pushed up the price retailers pay for diesel. While the wholesale price has eased in the last few days this is likely to be temporary, especially if the EU agrees to ban imports of Russian oil. Williams adds that the 5p per litre cut in fuel duty in March’s Spring Statement has had little impact: “Unfortunately, drivers with diesel vehicles need to brace themselves for yet more pain at the pumps. Had Mr Sunak reduced VAT to 15% as we call on him to do instead of cutting duty by 5p, drivers of diesel vehicles would be around 2p a litre better off, or £1 for every full tank. As it is, drivers are still paying 27p VAT on petrol and 29p on diesel, which is just the same as before the Spring Statement. “The average price of petrol is also on the rise having gone up nearly 3p a litre since the start of the month to 166.65p which means it’s less than a penny away from the all-time high of 167.30p set on 22 March.” Here are next year’s growth forecast for the EU: The surge in energy costs has dragged the eurozone into a record trade deficit with the rest of the world. The euro area recorded a €16.4bn deficit in trade in goods with the rest of the world in March 2022, compared with a surplus of €22.5bn in the same month a year ago, the latest trade data shows. Adjusted for seasonal swings, the eurozone trade gap was even bigger at €17.6bn. The wider EU recorded a €27.7bn deficit in trade in goods in March. In January-March, the EU ran up an €81.5bn deficit in trade in goods, compared with a €48.5bn surplus a year earlier. That’s mainly due to the surge in wholesale energy costs, which has pushed up the cost of Europe’s energy imports by 138% in the first quarter of the year (from €69.1bn to €164.7bn). As a result, the EU’s deficit in energy trade almost tripled to €128.7bn in Q1. A fair chunk of that money will have gone to Moscow. The EU’s trade deficit with Russia has more than quadrupled in January-March, to €45.2bn from €10.8bn in Q1 2021. Portugal is expected to record the fastest growth in the EU this year, at 5.8%, followed by Ireland with 5.4%. The weakest growth is seen in Estonia, with just 1%, followed by Germany and Finland with 1.6% each. The UK, incidentally, is expected to grow by 3.4% this year, faster than the eurozone and EU average of 2.7%. However. UK growth is seen slowing to 1.6% in 2023, slower than the European average of 2.3% -- but better than the small contraction forecast by the Bank of England. Here are the key charts from the EC’s new forecasts: Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy, warns that Europe’s growth could be even lower, and inflation even higher, depending how the Ukraine war develops. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is causing untold suffering and destruction, but is also weighing on Europe’s economic recovery. The war has led to a surge in energy prices and further disrupted supply chains, so that inflation is now set to remain higher for longer. Last year’s strong economic rebound will have a lingering positive effect on growth rates this year. A strong labour market, post-pandemic reopening and NextGenerationEU should provide further support to our economies and help to drive public debt and deficits lower. This forecast is however subject to high uncertainty and risks that are closely linked to the development of Russia’s war. Other scenarios are possible under which growth may be lower and inflation higher than we are projecting today.” Europe’s growth will be “much more subdued” than previously expected, due to the Ukraine war, says Valdis Dombrovskis, executive vice-president for an Economy that Works for People. Explaining today’s growth downgrades, Dombrovskis says: “There is no doubt that the EU economy is going through a challenging period due to Russia’s war against Ukraine, and we have downgraded our forecast accordingly. The overwhelming negative factor is the surge in energy prices, driving inflation to record highs and putting a strain on European businesses and households. While growth will continue this year and next, it will be much more subdued than previously expected. Uncertainty and risks to the outlook will remain high as long as Russia’s aggression continues. But there are some positives that allow us to weather this crisis. Our economic fundamentals are solid: before this war started, the EU economy had embarked on a path of strong recovery and growth More jobs are being created in the EU economy, attracting more people into the labour market and keeping unemployment low. And as Member States put their recovery and resilience plans into full effect, this will provide a much-needed boost to our economic strength.” The European Commission has cut its forecast for European growth this year, and hiked its inflation forecast, as the Ukraine war hits the economy. In its latest Spring forecasts, the EC predicts real GDP growth in both the EU and the euro area of 2.7% in 2022, down from 4% forecast three months ago. Growth is expected to slow to 2.3% in 2023, down from a previous forecast of 2.8% in the EU (and 2.7% in the euro area). And with energy prices having soared this year, inflation is expected to average 6.1% in 2022, and peak at 6.9% in the current quarter (it hit 7.5% in April, the highest rate in the history of the monetary union). That’s a “considerable upward revision compared to the Winter 2022 interim Forecast” of 3.5% inflation, the Commission says. Inflation is then seen falling to 2.7% in 2023, still over the European Central Bank’s 2% target. The Commission says: The outlook for the EU economy before the outbreak of the war was for a prolonged and robust expansion. But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has posed new challenges, just as the Union had recovered from the economic impacts of the pandemic. By exerting further upward pressures on commodity prices, causing renewed supply disruptions and increasing uncertainty, the war is exacerbating pre-existing headwinds to growth, which were previously expected to subside. The report highlights that the Ukraine war has added to pre-existing headwinds facing the economy. It has led to rising energy commodity prices, supply chain disruption and more expensive food and other basic goods and services. The report says: The main hit to the global and EU economies comes through energy commodity prices. Although they had already increased substantially before the war, from the low levels recorded during the pandemic, uncertainty about supply chains has pressured prices upwards, while increasing their volatility. This is true for food and other basic goods and services, with households’ purchasing power declining. The sharp falls in retail sales and industrial production in April is a sign that China’s growth rate likely to contract this quarter, warns ING. ING analyst Iris Pang predicts that China’s GDP will contract by around 1% in Q2 2022, following the 11.1% drop in retail sales, the 2.9% fall in industrial output, and the rise in unemployment to 6.1% in April. The overview of the data paints a gloomy picture of the economy. Our GDP forecast of -1% YoY for the second quarter is confirmed by this activity data. The main reason is the long lockdown in Shanghai. This hurt retail sales the most, and also those factories that do not have “closed-loop operation”; if they don’t have domitories for workers, they struggle to operate. Moreover, logistics were heavily disrupted as the movement in and out of Shanghai is difficult, and most logistics were used for transporting daily necessities and medical resources. Our concern is whether China will have lockdowns elsewhere, for instance in Bejing, Pang adds: The key question for us is how long future lockdowns will be. Any city that has to endure a 1-month lockdown will have its GDP in contraction on a yearly basis for that month. A 2-month lockdown may have a longer impact of more than 2 months as the jobless rate will increase, and people need time to find another job but at the same time firms are not ready to hire. Lifestyle brand Made.com has slashed its sales forecasts and issued a profits warning, warning that the market is much weaker than forecast. Made.com, which sells furniture, kitchen equipment and other household goods online, reports that trading has been “volatile in recent months and more challenging than anticipated at the start of the year”. It now expects gross sales to fall by up to 15% this year, with adjusted EBITDA earnings to show a loss of between £15m and £35m. Back in March, Made.com had forecast gross sales growth of between 15% and 25%, and positive adjusted EBITDA between £5m and £15m, on the assumption that global supply chain disruptions normalise. Today, though, it says it the market backdrop for 2022 is “much weaker”, so it now expect to miss its target of £1.2bn of gross sales by 2025. Nicola Thompson, Chief Executive Officer, said, “There is no escaping the tough trading environment at the moment. However, we are laser-focused on executing our strategy and we are delivering strong progress across each of our strategic pillars. Our customers are at the heart of our business and we’re seeing a really positive reaction to our improved proposition, with average lead times consistently at the targeted 3-4 weeks average for the last two months. MADE continues to outperform the online furniture and home market and I am confident the company will emerge in a very strong position.” Made’s CFO Adrian Evans is stepping down in June, to be replaced by Patrick Lewis, the great grandson of the founder of John Lewis. Shares in Made.com are down 15% at record lows, around 54p. They’ve lost almost three-quarters of their value since floating at 200p less than a year ago... Ofgem’s proposal to update Britain’s price cap every three months could mean bills jump again in January, warns Justina Miltienyte, head of policy at Uswitch.com: “Updating the price cap on a quarterly basis would mean a second update hot on the heels of October’s expected increase in rates. “This could demand a swift revision to household budgets at one of the most expensive times of year, raising the possibility of a painful New Year hangover. “Until now, the price cap has at best acted as a delay mechanism for the pain of rising wholesale prices, but it is unable to prevent harsh increases hitting customers altogether. A quarterly review means that the ability of the cap to delay the pain of rising prices is shorter. “Conversely, if wholesale prices start falling, Ofgem would have the ability to pass these through to those on standard plans a little sooner. “The price cap has always been a sticking plaster to deal with the problems of the energy market, and this proposed change is another attempted quick fix. The cap fails to give real, meaningful help to those who need it the most and this has been brought into extreme focus as costs have rocketed. More fundamental longer-term reform is still needed.” Ryanair has warned of a “fragile” recovery in airline passenger numbers after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the Omicron coronavirus variant pushed it to a €355m loss for the financial year. The Irish airline would aim for a “return to reasonable profitability” over the financial year to March 2023, it said on Monday, after it lost €1.4bn (£1.2bn) during the first two pandemic-affected financial years. Airlines have been hanging on for the return of passengers following two years of travel restrictions. There were high hopes for significant earnings in the 2022 summer holiday season after many countries lifted bans on tourism, but the knock-on effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine plus staffing difficulties have clouded airlines’ prospects. Michael O’Leary, the Ryanair chief executive, said “we hope to return to reasonable profitability” in the coming year and highlighted “pent-up demand” despite uncertainty. The “recovery is strong but can be fragile”, he said. “With luck we’ll have a strong summer.” Here’s the full story: UK energy regulator Ofgem has outlined plans that, if implemented, would see the price cap on bills in Great Britain changed twice as often. Ofgem is proposing that the energy price cap, the mechanism that determines gas and electricity bills for 22 million households, could soon be reviewed every three months, rather than six as it is currently. This would let bills adjust faster to changes in wholesale prices, the regulator argues, and reduce the risk of further supplier failures -- after around 30 energy suppliers collapsed since the start of last year. The cap rose by 54% in April, to £1,971 per year for an average bill, and could jump to around £2,900 in October. Ofgem argues that a more frequent cap change means savings would be passed on faster to customers when wholesale gas prices fall. But, it would also allow energy suppliers to pass on rising prices sooner, rather than run at a loss for many months. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley told Sky News it would also mean that bills could go up quicker, but they would also fall more rapidly in reaction to wholesale price shifts. “I remember back in the 2010s when people saw their prices go up and were waiting and wondering why prices didn’t come down equally quickly. “The good thing about the price cap is that we will make sure it only reflects costs, and therefore it only reflects what you need to pay for your energy.” Brearley warned that October is likely to bring more pain to households: “With the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we are seeing a sustained increase, a further increase, in gas prices. So, the difficult news I have is that it is likely in October that prices will go up again.” Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at interactive investor, warns more regular price increases would worry strugging consumers: “Adjusting the cap more regularly in the current high and rising inflation environment means energy bills will go up more frequently, which could spell disaster for households already struggling to stay financially afloat. With the cost of seemingly everything else also on the up, more regular price rises will be a worry for many. “However, smaller but more frequent price changes would be more palatable than less frequent but sharp price hikes for many consumers as it provides greater consistency. It is easier to budget for smaller price hikes than larger ones. “A more regular review of the energy price cap would mean that prices would come down as quickly as they go up. However, high inflation means the latter will be a reality for some time. As such, it is important to regularly review your spending habits to ensure that you are living with within your means and plan ahead to avoid money worries in future. In Germany, manufacturers are wrestling with an unprecedented backlog of orders, as supply bottlenecks continue to hit the sector. The Munich-based ifo institute reports that the order backlog among Germany’s manufacturers is currently at a record high. Even if no new orders came in, production could continue for 4.5 months. Timo Wollmershäuser, Head of Forecasts at ifo, explains: “The order backlog reflects both the high demand for German industrial goods over the past few months, and the difficulties companies are having processing existing orders promptly due to the shortage of key intermediate products and raw materials.” In the UK, food-to-go baking chain Greggs says sales in big cities and office locations lagging behind its other stores, as cost pressures rise. In a trading update, Greggs reported that like-for-like sales in company-managed shops are up 27.4% so far this year, partly due to trading restrictions on shops a year ago, and 15.8% over the last 10 weeks. Sales at transport locations have shown a marked increase in activity in recent weeks. However, demand at larger cities and in office locations is slower than at other outlets, with some office workers still working from home part of the week. Greggs reports that: Sales of hot food and snacks are showing particularly strong growth, with chicken goujons and potato wedges proving popular. Greggs also warns that “market-wide cost pressures” have been increasing (such as rising ener",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
y costs and raw ingredients such as wheat and oil), and also expects consumer incomes to come under pressure in the second half of the year as inflation keeps rising. We will continue to work to mitigate the impact of cost pressures whilst protecting Greggs’ reputation for exceptional value. Greggs could face a shareholder revolt later this week, with two respected investor advisory groups unhappy about its high pay packets for executives: George Magnus, an associate at Oxford University’s China Centre, says layoffs in the property and tech sector are pushing unemployment up in China: Stocks have opened lower in London, as China’s April slowdown added to concerns about the economic outlook. The FTSE 100 index of blue-chip shares has dropped 50 points, or 0.7%, to 7368 points. Equipment rental firm Ashtead (-2.7%) and packaging group Smurfit Kappa (-2.4%) are among the top fallers, along with engineering group Rolls-Royce (-2.5%) and airline group IAG (-2.2%). European markets are also lower, with Germany’s DAX index down 0.5% and France’s CAC down 0.8%. China’s property sales fell sharply in April too, as Covid-19 lockdowns hit demand. Reuters has the details: Property sales by value in April slumped 46.6% from a year earlier, the biggest drop since August 2006, and sharply widening from the 26.17% fall in March, according to Reuters calculations based on data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released on Monday. Property sales in January-April by value fell 29.5% year-on-year, compared with a 22.7% decline in the first three months. China’s property sector has been strugging with a liquidity crisis, after Beijing brought in rules to rein in property developers’ debt. That has been exacerbated by strict lockdown measures to combat Covid-19 outbreaks. Last week, Chinese property developer Sunac became the latest company in the sector to default on a bond payment, in a real estate crisis that began at indebted property group Evergrande. China’s slowdown in April will reinforce global growth concerns, warns Lee Hardman of MUFG bank: Economic weakness was widespread in April as retail sales contracted by an annual rate of -11.1%, industrial production by -2.9% and property investment by -2.7% on a year to date basis. The latest data clearly highlights the economic damage inflected by the government’s continued commitment to their zero-COVID strategy. It will encourage further downgrades to forecasts for economic growth in Q2 and for this year as a whole. The current Bloomberg consensus forecast is for annual GDP growth to slow from 4.8% in Q1 to 4.0% which now appears too optimistic. The longer the COVID restrictions remain in place the greater the downside risks to growth for the year as whole and the current Bloomberg consensus forecast for growth of 4.8% in 2022. Tommy Wu, lead China economist at Oxford Economics, said lockdowns are ‘severely’ affectin China’s supply chains: “The prolonged Shanghai lockdown and its ripple effect through China, as well as logistics delays resulting from highway controls... have severely affected domestic supply chains,” China’s disappointing economic numbers have buffeted economic sentiment further, reports Naeem Aslam, analyst at Avatade: Clearly, it is China’s zero-tolerance policy that is causing the industrial output and consumer spending to break down, and currently, they are sitting at their worst level since the pandemic began. The data has made traders anxious about the global economic outlook. The general trend is likely to prevail in the market, which is that the dollar index continues to act as a safe haven, Treasuries will soar, and oil prices may move further lower; this shows that this week could be another week of weakness for the global equity markets. Fu Linghui, spokesperson for the National Bureau of Statistics, told reporters that China’s economy took a hit from the rise in Covid-19 cases in April. But Fu added that the impact will be “short-lived”, and that the economy will recover. “The fundamentals of the Chinese economy remain unchanged. The overall trends of economic transformation and upgrading and high-quality development remain unchanged. “There are many favorable conditions for stabilizing the economy and achieving the expected development goals. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the world economy and the financial markets. China economic slowdown has accelerated as Covid-19 lockdowns hit its factory sector hard, consumers slashed their spending, and unemployment rose. Retail sales and factory output both plunged at the fastest rate since early in the pandemic, with analysts warning of no quick recovery. Retail sales fell by 11.1% in April from a year ago, almost twice as bad as the 6.1% fall expected by economists. It is the biggest slump since March 2020, in the first wave of Covid, with many consumers either under restrictions, or worried about the economic outlook. Industrial production dropped by 2.9% in April, year-on-year, dashing hopes of a rise of 0.4%. That’s the biggest fall since early 2020, as the ‘zero covid’ strategy forced factories to suspend operations and disrupted supply chains. China’s labour market took a hit too, with the nationwide jobless rate rising to 6.1% in April, up from 5.8%. That’s the highest rate since February 2020. The data shows the rising economic cost from the tough restrictions brought into quash outbreaks of the pandemic, such as lockdowns in Shanghai, and mass testing and quarantine centres in Beijing, where some businesses such as gyms, malls, and cinemas were closed in its largest district. Alicia García-Herrero, chief Asia Pacific economist at Natixis in Hong, told Al Jazeera that ““The data might be only the start of the recession”. “Given the continuation of the COVID restrictions in May, the data will not be good in this month as well. We shall expect more rescue policies to support private and small enterprises, which are important hubs for employment, as unemployment increased to 6.1% in April.” The slowdown will add to concerns that the world economy could be weakening. Last night, former Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein warned there was a “very, very high risk” that the US economy was heading towards a recession. Blankfein, now Goldman’s Senior Chairman, told CBS News’ “Face the Nation” that companies and consumers should prepare for a recession as the Federal Reserve lifts interest rates to tackle inflation, but added that it’s not ‘baked in the cake’ yet. “If I were running a big company, I would be very prepared for it,. If I was a consumer, I’d be prepared for it.” European stock markets are set to open a little lower, having ended last week with a strong rally. But despite that bounce, global stocks sank for a sixth consecutive week, the longest losing streak since the middle of 2008. Also coming up today The European Commission is set to cut its prediction for 2022 euro-area growth and almost double its estimate for inflation, when it releases its latest economic forecasts today. Draft documents seen by Bloomberg and the FT show that the eurozone is seen growing by 2.7% this year, and 2.3% next year, down from 4% and 2.7% forecast in February. Inflation is expected to rise over 6%, as consumers and businesses are hit by the energy crisis following the Ukraine war. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey faces a grilling over the UK’s surge in inflation, when he appears before the Treasury Committee. Conservative MPs are expected to criticise Bailey’s handling of inflation, which is expected to hit 10% later this year. One cabinet minister has told the Telegraph that the Bank has been failing to “get things right”," with another saying government figures were “questioning its independence”.

‘Death to the enemy’: Ukraine’s news channels unite to cover war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/death-to-the-enemy-ukraine-news-channels-unite-to-cover-war,2022-05-25T04:00:26Z,State-backed broadcast has strategic and practical justifications but some see it as dangerous monopoly,"In an age of social media and satellite television, the singular wartime news bulletin evokes images of families tuning in to the radio during the second world war. But in Ukraine, the state-backed broadcast has remerged, albeit with a 21st-century spin. Shortly after Russia invaded, the country’s main TV channels started broadcasting the same content 24 hours a day, nicknamed the United News telemarathon. Each channel has a daily slot on the broadcast, which is shown simultaneously on all the channels. United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels. It has since been signed into law and now includes all Ukrainian channels that used to show news. The head of Ukraine’s parliamentary broadcasting committee said he believed the arrangement should continue until the war ends. While some say there are critical strategic justifications for the telemarathon, others argue that it amounts to a monopoly of the information space by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and could be exploited for political purposes. “The telemarathon is the information war equivalent of our anti-aircraft systems and I think it’s the most optimal option for Ukraine right now,” said Svitlana Ostapa, the deputy head of Detector Media, a media monitoring organisation that tracks propaganda, disinformation and political interference in Ukraine. “It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population. In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that experts said worked to destabilise the country. There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together. “Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,” Ostapa said. “The top ministers and officials do not have the time to comment to more than half a dozen channels, and this format means they are communicating with the population once a day and not being seen to favour one channel.” The language used by Ukraine’s TV presenters has changed dramatically, reflecting usage among the wider population. Russian soldiers are often called “occupiers”, “terrorists”, “orcs” and “Rashists” – a combination of the words Russian and fascist. Guests are welcomed with the greeting “Glory to Ukraine!”, to which they answer “Glory to the heroes!”. The famous words of a Ukrainian soldier tasked with defending Snake Island in the Black Sea, who was recorded over the military radio saying “Russian ship go fuck yourself”, are mentioned without the swearword being censored, and the presenters regularly end their segments with “Death to the enemy!”, a historic Ukrainian wartime slogan. The 24-hour wartime news focuses on the Ukrainian military’s victories, its defence of Ukraine’s frontlines and Russia’s war crimes. The abrupt collapse of Ukraine’s economy in February means there is almost no advertising. Commercial breaks advertise hotlines for finding missing loved ones and reporting war crimes, as well as videos produced by normal Ukrainians, the Ukrainian army press service and the presidential office about the resistance of Ukrainian soldiers and citizens. Ostapa said the language and messaging were discussed in editorial meetings between all the channels involved, the culture ministry and the national broadcasting council, and there was now a move to ban slogans containing swearwords. The overarching editorial message of the telemarathon is Ukrainian resistance in the face of Russian brutality, Ostapa wrote in one her analysis pieces. The TV channel heads have rejected accusations that the authorities dictate the content, saying dialogue with officials includes things such as censoring information that reveals Ukrainian military positions. And since May, Ukrainians looking for an alternative to news can tune in to other channels that show films and cartoons about good winning out against evil. But some see the unified TV coverage as propagandistic and point to the fact that airtime is now almost exclusively given to people close to the president, including regular comedy sketches by the president’s former comic colleagues. “The telemarathon is an attempt by the presidential office to gain even greater control over the information space,” said Aksenyia Kurina, a journalist and campaigner who has spent her career focusing on censorship in Ukraine. “We may soon find ourselves in a heavily censored information space.” Zelenskiy won the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election with more than 70% of the vote, thanks in large part, said Kurina, to his innovative digital campaign. Zelenskiy’s party also controls Ukraine’s parliament. Though Ukraine’s media have celebrated a marked change in their president since the invasion, Zelenskiy was on terse terms with some journalists before the war. He was known to publicly display disdain towards journalists who asked critical questions, and his press service ostracised some reporters for critical coverage. “The telemarathon does not reflect reality, it forms a picture that the authorities would like to see. This is dangerous, because at some point the authorities may begin to believe in their own propaganda,” said Kurina. “I understand that many journalists are not able to cope with their emotions at the moment, for many this is a personal traumatic experience, but it is important to remember professional ethics and not to allow hate speech.” Notably, three channels owned by Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko and that are close to his associates have not been given slots and therefore do not contribute to the telemarathon’s content or editorial meetings. Poroshenko was charged with treason after Zelenskiy came to power, a case that the former president says is politically motivated. At first, Poroshenko’s channels split their coverage 50-50 between the telemarathon and their own content. But since in mid-March all channels – except for those dedicated to light entertainment – are obliged to stream the telemarathon. The head of one of Poroshenko’s channels has said that despite their appeals to be included, they are still waiting to hear from the authorities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis,2022-06-03T19:00:16Z,100 days of Vladimir Putin’s war; fight for Sievierodonetsk as eastern city becomes key war aim for Moscow; a closer look at Biden’s pledge to send high-tech rocket systems,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. 100 days of a war that is reshaping Europe Michael Safi and Courtney Yusuf charted the war, starting from the final hours of the decades-long peace enjoyed by Europe’s major powers. On 23 February, Volodomyr Ksienich, a 22-year-old student organiser, spent the night with friends. They talked about the war, of course. “Nobody really believed it would happen,” he says. Many analysts concurred. The Russian forces massing on the border were too few to occupy the country, they argued. State media had done little to prepare the Russian public for war. An invasion would trigger economic penalties so ruinous to the Russian economy that no leader would dare risk it. All of this was true, and they were wrong. Seán Clarke, Pablo Gutiérrez and Monika Cvorak tracked the bloody war of attrition that has since devastated Ukraine, killed thousands and displaced millions. Their graphic guide charts the crisis in four phases: Russia’s initial invasion, the hampered advance into Kyiv, the retreat and reorientation of its forces, and the assault now under way in Ukraine’s east. The progression of Russian control is recorded and superimposed across a map of Ukraine as the conflict progresses, as collated by the Institute for the Study of War and the American Enterprise Institute’s critical threats project. The fight for Sievierodonetsk Russia’s forces appear to be taking control of the strategically important city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s east, as more western allies promise additional missile systems and arms to Kyiv. Jon Henley reported that 80% of the city is now in Russian hands. Capturing Sievierodonetsk would give the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, control of all of Luhansk – the region that, with Donetsk, makes up Ukraine’s Donbas industrial heartland – consolidating a shift in battlefield momentum after his forces were pushed back from Kyiv and northern Ukraine. In scenes eerily similar to Mariupol and its Azovstal steelworks, about 800 people, including children, were reported to be hiding beneath a chemical factory in the city amid the fighting. Peter Beaumont and the Guardian’s defence and security editor, Dan Sabbagh, reported on the high levels of attrition on the Ukrainian side, whose defenders have been pounded by Russian shelling. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy told the US Newsmax TV channel: “The situation is very difficult – we’re losing 60 to 100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action.” Gone for now are the Russian attempts at wider encirclements of Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, which included a failed river crossing in early May. Instead, units are focused on smaller encirclements – or “cauldrons” – and sheer concentration at Sievierodonetsk. The expected loss of Sievierdonetsk, however, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said this week, adding that the war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance. The struggle to find and bury Mariupol’s dead Isobel Koshiw reports on the tens of thousands of people trying to identify their loved ones in Mariupol after the besieged port city finally capitulated to Russian forces last month. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the city’s mayor, estimated that 22,000 died in the two months of fighting. However, one person among several coordinating burials in the city, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they believed the total was closer to 50,000. With the temperatures rising as summer approaches, the odour of dead bodies wafts down certain streets. There are bodies still trapped under rubble or in flats or buried in shallow makeshift or mass graves – a number of which appear to have been poorly marked or even unmarked. Others were left in the street and rotted, and some may have disintegrated if they were hit directly or burned in a fire. Families navigate a chaotic burial process, spending days scrolling through social media groups and spreadsheets of those believed to have died, looking for news. Biden answers plea for heavy weapons Peter Beaumont reported on Joe Biden confirming he will send more advanced rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. As Luke Harding reported from Mykolaiv, such a deployment from the west has the potential to change the outcome of the war. Roman Kostenko, a member of Ukraine’s parliament and a special forces commander, told the Guardian: “If our partners give us heavy artillery and advanced systems like MRLS [multiple-launch rocket systems], we can win and take back occupied territory.” However, world affairs editor Julian Borger noted that the deal was for just four systems and came with strings attached and was still weeks away from being operational. He wrote: “Biden has made clear that he will not allow a catastrophic failure of Ukrainian defences, but it is just as evident he has concerns about the implications of catastrophic success, a rout of Russian forces with the decisive help of western weapons, bringing with it the danger of a defeated Putin lashing out.” Russia-linked superyachts ‘going dark’ to avoid sanctions threat In the sparkling azure waters of Antigua, the gleaming £95m superyacht Alfa Nero could recently be seen at anchor by sightseers enjoying the Caribbean coastline. But few of the tourists who spotted its sleek black hull would have appreciated that it was quite a find, reported Jon Ungoed-Thomas and Gemma Handy. Vessels with ties to Russian oligarchs hit by sanctions are no longer reporting their position to an automatic global locator, and the Alfa Nero – linked to the Russian billionaire Andrey Guryev – is one of them. At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems as the global hunt for the assets of Russia’s super-rich intensifies, an investigation by the Observer revealed. One crew member on a superyacht linked to a Russian oligarch sanctioned by the UK said: “We were told to turn off the AIS [automatic identification system]. We removed the screws on the power plug and pulled it out.” Our visual guide to the invasion is updated regularly and can be found here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine has won the battle of Kharkiv, analysts say, as Kyiv warns of ‘long phase of war’",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/ukraine-has-won-the-battle-of-kharkiv-analysts-say-as-kyiv-warns-of-long-phase-of-war,2022-05-14T05:52:13Z,"US-based thinktank claims Russian troops are being pushed back eastwards from Ukraine’s second city, and aiming to use mercenaries","Ukrainian forces “appear to have won the battle of Kharkiv”, according to a US defence thinktank, in what appears to be their fastest advance since Russian troops pulled away from Kyiv and the north-east over a month ago. In another apparent setback to Vladimir Putin’s war aims, analysts said on Saturday that Russian units had not attempted to hold their lines against counterattacking Ukrainian troops around the city. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and only 31 miles (50km) from the Russian border, has been under enemy bombardment since the war began in February. But the US-based Institute for the Study of War said in its latest assessment of the conflict that the Russians appeared to be dropping back and aimed to replace their own troops with proxy forces or mercenaries. “Ukraine thus appears to have won the battle of Kharkiv,” the institute said. “Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv.” Russian units had “generally not attempted to hold ground against counterattacking Ukrainian forces over the past several days, with a few exceptions”. “Reports from western officials and a video from an officer of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) indicate that Moscow is focused on conducting an orderly withdrawal and prioritizing getting Russians back home before allowing proxy forces to enter Russia rather than trying to hold its positions near the city.” Ukraine now controls territory stretching to the Siverskyi Donets river, around 25 miles (40km) to the east of the city. “We are entering a new, long phase of the war,” the Ukrainian defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said in a Facebook post on Friday night, predicting “extremely tough weeks” ahead during which he said Ukraine would largely be alone against an “enraged aggressor”. However, Moscow is still bombarding villages north of Kharkiv. Some six miles north of the city, firefighters doused smouldering wreckage in Dergachi after what local officials said was an overnight Russian missile attack on the House of Culture, used to distribute aid. Volunteers inside were trying to salvage packages of baby diapers and formula. “I can’t call it anything but a terrorist act,” the mayor, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, told Reuters. “They wanted to hit the base where we store provisions and create a humanitarian catastrophe.” Earlier on Friday, British defence intelligence said Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – usually around 800 strong – in a failed attempt to cross a strategically important river in the Donbas, to the south-east of Kharkiv. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, losing armour and bridging equipment. “We have eliminated Russian speedboats and helicopters, which they used to cover their attempts,” the governor added, while aerial photography showed destroyed pontoon bridges and armour by the riverbanks. Ukraine’s defence ministry tweeted pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles in Bilohorivka on Wednesday, describing them as showing victims of “artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade”. Analysts believe Russian attempts to gain territory in the Donbas are increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces – and the Russian forces were trying to cross the river in an attempt to cut off the town. However, the Institute of War said the Russians had “made no progress” with an attempted ground offensive from Izium, and that the Kremlin might not have enough troops to complete an encirclement of Severodonetsk. “The Russians may not have enough additional fresh combat power to offset those losses and continue the offensive on a large enough scale to complete the encirclement, although they will likely continue to try to do so,” the institute said. Other key developments in the war were: “Very difficult negotiations” are under way on the next stage of evacuations from Mariupol and the Azovstal steel plant, where the city’s last remaining Ukrainian defenders are holed up, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said in his latest nightly address. “We do not stop trying to save all our people from Mariupol and Azovstal. Currently, very difficult negotiations are under way on the next stage of the evacuation mission – the rescue of the seriously wounded, medics.” Zelenskiy also warned that the war and Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports were “provoking a large-scale food crisis”, adding that “Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries”. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. The US president, Joe Biden, expressed his support for the right of Finland and Sweden “to decide their own future, foreign policy and security arrangements” in a call with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. In their first conversation since the invasion, the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke by telephone on Friday with his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, seeking an immediate ceasefire and stressing the importance of open lines of communication. Foreign ministers from the G7 group of rich nations backed giving Ukraine more aid and arms, and the European Union’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, announced a further €500m ($520m) worth of military support that should be approved next week by EU members. He voiced confidence the bloc will agree an embargo on Russian oil. Ukraine’s foreign minister told the meeting in Germany he hoped EU holdout Hungary would agree to the oil embargo. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, wants hundreds of millions of dollars in compensation before agreeing to a ban.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Russia tightens its grip on the Donbas Peter Beaumont reported this week on Russia’s advances in the Donbas region, with Ukrainian officials admitting that Moscow has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east as defending forces fell back from some of their positions. Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken, Ukraine’s general staff said that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, which makes up the southern part of the Donbas, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago. Ukraine’s president has also given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by his forces in the Donbas. “Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. The plight of Mariupol’s survivors Shaun Walker has written about the horrors endured by Mariupol’s remaining residents, following the end of Russia’s devastating months-long siege of the city. He spoke to Svitlana and Vitaly, a couple who lost almost everything, including their unborn baby, before being forced into a wearying and humiliating journey through so-called “filtration” procedures, followed by forced deportation to Russia. “There’s nothing there,” Vitaly said bitterly. “Nothing. It’s over. Mariupol is over.” Meanwhile, Andrew Roth reported on Russia’s deployment of mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. “The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”. The Guardian documents Russia’s use of illegal weapons As prosecutors investigate alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine, reporters Lorenzo Tondo and Isobel Koshiw, and photographer Alessio Mamo revealed the evidence they discovered on the ground: cluster bombs, fléchettes and unguided missiles on residential areas. On 1 March, a Russian air force jet dropped a series of 250kg Soviet-era FAB-250 bombs over Borodyanka, north of Kyiv – explosives designed to hit military targets such as enemy fortifications and bunkers. The bombs fell on at least five residential buildings, splitting them in two. Dozens of bodies were found under the rubble when the Russians withdrew. Bellingcat, a not-for-profit online journalism collective dedicated to war crime investigations, reviewed some of the pictures collected by the Guardian and confirmed the presence of cluster bombs in towns and villages occupied by the Russians. The weapons, banned in more than 100 countries (but not the US, Russia or Ukraine) were unleashed in areas with no military personnel and no military infrastructure. ‘I lost everything’ Lorenzo Tondo met Ivan Mishchenko, a farmer in a small village north of Kyiv whose plight mirrors that of hundreds like him and has worsened food insecurity around the world. Their businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, Mishchenko’s few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling. “The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” Mishchenko said. Last child leaves Kutuzivka Daniel Boffey reported on eight-year-old Tymofiy Seidov, the last child in a ruined village in north-east Ukraine to be evacuated with his family from the basement in which they lived for three months, after a benefactor read of their plight in the Guardian. Tymofiy did not want to come out of his underground home in Kutuzivka, east of Kharkiv, owing to Russian fire, but he was gently persuaded to leave on Sunday by his mother, Rita Sotnikova. The family’s evacuation was made possible after a Guardian reader with connections to Ukraine Now, a not-for-profit organisation, made contact to offer logistical help.

European Council is ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid in its post-war reconstruction – as it happened ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/30/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-intensifies-assault-on-sievierodonetsk-zelenskiy-to-address-eu-leaders-live,2022-05-31T01:49:07Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","Before we close today’s live blog, here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand. EU leaders have backed a partial embargo on Russian oil after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels. The sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports with the aim to ban 90% of all Russian oil imported to Europe by the end of the year, officials said. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement” that would place “maximum pressure on Russia to end the war”. The compromise excludes the Druzhba pipeline from the oil embargo and exempts deliveries arriving in Europe by pipeline, after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán warned halting supplies would wreck his country’s economy. The latest sanctions package also includes removing access to Swift payments for Russia’s largest bank, Sberbank; banning three more Russian state-owned broadcasters; and further sanctions against “individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine”. European Council president Charles Michel addressed speculation of disunity within the EU in the days leading up to the agreement. “In the recent hours and recent days there was speculation about a lack of European unity,” he told reporters. “We do not underestimate all the difficulties. We know that we needed a few weeks before we were able to take a decision.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier lamented the delay in EU leaders imposing heavier sanctions against Vladimir Putin. “The pause in agreeing on new sanctions in Europe has been too long,” he said. The European Council added it is ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid in its post-war reconstruction. The Council will “continue helping Ukraine with its immediate liquidity needs, together with the G7” European Council President Charles Michel said late on Monday night. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned that Ukraine needed €5bn a month just to maintain basic services and “... to give Ukraine a fair chance to rise from the ashes”. Zelenskiy claims that Russia is blocking the export of 22m tons of grain from Ukraine’s ports and warned it posed a threat of famine. “Russia’s blockade of our exports is destabilising the situation on a global scale,” he said in his latest national address. Zelenskiy added that Russian forces “have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain” and “are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere”. The situation in Donbas remains “extremely difficult”, Zelenskiy said, adding that Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again on Monday. “The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia,” he said. Russian tanks and troops begun advancing into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine, bringing fighting to the streets on Monday. The regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, described “heavy battles” and said the fighting was “very fierce”. Russian president Vladimir Putin spoke with Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, saying if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”. Joe Biden has said the US will not supply Ukraine with long-range rockets capable of reaching Russia. Ukraine has asked for multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of about 300km (185 miles) to offset Moscow’s increasingly effective use of long-range artillery. France is set to boost military aid to Ukraine. Foreign minister Catherine Colonna said France will “continue to reinforce arms deliveries” while visiting Kyiv on Monday. Belarus will conduct military mobilisation exercises in June and July in the Gomel region, state news agency BelTA reports. Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures. The Georgian breakaway region of South Ossetia has scrapped plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia which had been scheduled for 17 July. The Moscow-controlled enclave’s president Alan Gagloev warned of the “uncertainty of the legal consequences of the issue submitted to a referendum,” according to a report from Agence France-Presse. French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, 32, has been killed after an armoured evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian and French authorities have said. France has called for an investigation into the reporter’s death as Zelenskiy offered his “sincere condolences” to his colleagues and family. The first alleged case of rape by a Russian soldier has been sent to court, the prosecutor general of Ukraine said. The serviceman will be tried for the alleged murder of the victim’s husband and “sexual violence against his wife”, Iryna Venediktova said. The Eurovision song contest winners Kalush Orchestra auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army. The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised $900,000 (£713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone and a further $370,000 by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance. That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also provided an update on Donbas, describing the situation as “extremely difficult”. The situation in Donbas remains extremely difficult. The Russian army is trying to gather overwhelming forces in certain areas to put more and more pressure on our defenders. There, in Donbas, the maximum combat power of the Russian army is now gathered. Severodonetsk, Lysychansk, Bakhmut, Avdiivka, Kurakhove, Slovyansk and some other settlements remain key targets for the occupiers in this direction.” Zelenskiy added that Russian troops shelled Kharkiv again on Monday. The territory of our Sumy region was also shelled across the border between Ukraine and Russia. The struggle for the Kherson region continues. Step by step, we are liberating our land and gradually approaching the point where Russia will have to lay down its arms, count all its dead and move to diplomacy.” The Georgian breakaway region of South Ossetia has scrapped plans to hold a referendum on joining Russia which had been scheduled for 17 July. The Moscow-controlled enclave’s president Alan Gagloev warned Monday about “uncertainty of the legal consequences of the issue submitted to a referendum,” according to a report from Agence France-Presse. The decree also stressed “the inadmissibility of a unilateral decision of a referendum on issues affecting the legitimate rights and interests of the Russian Federation”. Gagloev ordered “to hold, without delay, consultations with the Russian side on the entire range of issues related to the further integration of South Ossetia and the Russian Federation”. On 13 May, Gagloev’s predecessor, Anatoly Bibilov, signed a decree on holding the referendum, citing the region’s “historic aspiration” to join Russia, his office said at the time. However, Bibilov lost his bid for re-election earlier this month. It is another blow to Russia’s hopes for further unity among its allies. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has also claimed that Russia is blocking the export of 22m tons of grain from Ukraine’s ports. Now, due to the fact that Russia has blocked our ports in the Black Sea and seized our part of the coast of the Sea of Azov, we cannot export 22 million tons of grain that are already in warehouses in our country. This is the volume that was to enter the foreign market. And Russia’s blockade of our exports is destabilising the situation on a global scale. As a result, food is becoming increasingly expensive in different countries. Consequently, there is a threat of famine. In Africa, in Asia, in some European countries. This threat could escalate into a new migrant crisis. And this is what the Russian leadership clearly wants. They are deliberately creating this problem. So that the whole of Europe faces difficulties. And so that Ukraine does not receive billions of dollars for its exports. These are the billions that our economy really needs now. And the inhabitants of African and Asian countries are used by the Russian state simply as a bargaining chip.” Zelenskiy added that Russian forces “have already stolen at least half a million tons of grain” and “are now looking for ways to illegally sell it somewhere”. “To sell it in a way to make money on what was stolen and to keep the deficit in the legal market,” he added in his latest national address. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has also responded to the announcement of a partial ban of Russian oil imports. Welcome decision of EU leaders EUCO to ban Russian oil. A landmark decision to cripple Putin’s war machine. Our unity is our strength.” Here is a succinct rundown of tonight’s agreement on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia. “The sanctions will immediately impact 75% of Russian oil imports. And by the end of the year, 90% of the Russian oil imported in Europe will be banned,” president of the European Council, Charles Michel, has said. Just one hour ago, EU leaders backed a partial embargo on Russian oil after late-night talks at a summit in Brussels. The deal “immediately covers more than two-thirds of oil imports from Russia” with the aim to effectively cut around 90% of oil imports from Russia to the EU by the end of the year, officials said. Michel hailed the deal as a “remarkable achievement” that would place “maximum pressure on Russia to end the war”. EU leaders have addressed reporters following the announcement of a partial ban of Russian oil imports to the 27-nation bloc. European Council President Charles Michel described the decision to ban almost 90% of all Russian oil imports by the end of the year as a “remarkable achievement” and addressed speculation of disunity within the EU leading to the agreement. Speaking to the media late on Monday night, Michel said: This is a remarkable achievement by the European Council. We do not underestimate all the difficulties. We know that we needed a few weeks before we were able to take a decision. In the recent hours and recent days there was speculation about a lack of European unity and I think that more than ever it is important to show that we are able to be strong, that we are able to be firm, that we are able to be tough in order to defend our values and our interests.” EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen added that the decision “expresses a united message”. “Council should be able to now finalise a ban on almost 90% of all Russian oil imports by the end of the year,” she added. “This is an important step forward.” Von der Leyen said the council would “soon return to the issue of the remaining 10%” while reiterating that other elements in the package are also important. The European Council has said it is ready to grant Ukraine €9bn to aid in its post-war reconstruction. The Council will “continue helping Ukraine with its immediate liquidity needs, together with G7” European Council President Charles Michel said late on Monday night. EUCO is ready to grant Ukraine EUR 9 billion. Strong and concrete support to Ukraine’s reconstruction,” he added. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted: “I am glad that tonight leaders agreed in principle on the sixth sanctions package. This is an important step forward. We also agreed to work on a mechanism to provide Ukraine with a new, exceptional macro-financial assistance package of up to €9 billion.” As the Kremlin turns its military focus on Donbas, residents are evacuating whenever and however they can. Today, some displaced Ukrainians in Donetsk oblast evacuated by train. Belarus will conduct military mobilisation exercises in June and July in the Gomel region, state news agency BelTA is reporting. The Gomel region of Belarus borders Ukraine in the south and, in places, the exclusion zone around the site of the Chornobyl nuclear reactor disaster. To the east, it borders Russia. On 22 June-1July, planned exercises with military commissariats – military administrative agencies – and armed forces will be conducted, BelTA reported, citing Andrey Krivonosov, military commissar of the Gomel region. Events of this kind are traditionally held to increase the combat and mobilisation readiness of military commissariats, and improve military knowledge and practical skills of those liable for military service.” On 28 June-16 July, military training will take place with those liable for military service for territorial defence formations, Krivonosov said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has offered his condolences to the family of French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, who was killed after an armoured evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine. The 32-year-old worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. In his most recent national address, Zelenskiy said: Today in the Luhansk region, the occupiers disrupted the evacuation from the areas of hostilities by firing at a car following the locals. French journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was killed by the shelling. He worked for the French TV channel BFM TV. A little over a month ago, I gave an interview to this particular TV channel. This was my first interview with the French media during a full-scale war. My sincere condolences to Frédéric’s colleagues and family. He became the 32nd media representative killed after February 24.” After hours of last-minute negotiations – and failure to come to agreement – European Union leaders have agreed to ban more than two-thirds of of all Russian oil imports. The ban, which President Zelenskiy spent Monday advocating EU leaders for as a show of unity against Vladimir Putin, was heavily resisted by Hungary. Earlier compromises included exempting Russian oil transported through the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia from the EU embargo. While the ban will put the “maximum pressure on Russia to end the war”, as Charles Michel, president of the European Council, said on Twitter, it will also probably result in a hike in the already high gas prices across Europe, which is heavily reliant on Russian oil. European Union leaders have reached a partial agreement on an embargo of Russian oil at the summit, the Associated Press is reporting. More details to come. The Ukrainian prosecutor general is accusing Russian forces of committing a war crime today in the Sumy Oblast: firing shells filled with flechettes. Forensic doctors had previously discovered flechettes – small metal darts rarely used in modern warfare – embedded in people’s heads and chests in the city of Bucha. The first alleged case of rape by a Russian soldier was sent to court, the prosecutor general of Ukraine said. Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, the French journalist who was killed when the armoured evacuation vehicle he was travelling in was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in the city of Sievierodonetsk, was “cheerful, enthusiastic, caring, courageous and a wonderful journalist”, his colleagues said. Leclerc-Imhoff was 32 and on his second mission to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began on 24 February, according to news channel BFMTV, for which he worked for six years. “He cared a lot and I am proud of the choices he made,” his mother said. As Russian forces turn their focus on Donbas, Bakhmut, a city of 72,000 in Donetsk oblast, is getting heavily shelled. Here are some images from Bakhmut today: In addition to the phone call with Vladimir Putin today, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the president of Turkey, spoke with Volodymyr Zelenskiy on the phone, in which they discussed food security and sea ports. Reuters is reporting that Erdoğan specifically told Zelenskiy that he placed value on a project to create a safe sea route for exporting Ukrainian agricultural goods. “Erdoğan stated that he especially valued the project to create a secure sea route for exporting Ukrainian agricultural products,” his office said in a statement and added he welcomed, in principle, the idea of making Istanbul a headquarters for an “observation mechanism” between Moscow, Kyiv and the United Nations. While Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk in the Luhansk oblast sustained much of the Kremlin’s focus today, with Russian troops entering the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, Kharkiv in the northeast also took quite a bit of hits. Russian forces occupy about 31% of the Kharkiv region’s territory is occupied by Russian forces, but Ukrainian defenders have liberated about 5%, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration said. “We are not yet able to fully inspect some of the liberated settlements, conduct full-fledged de-mining and begin rebuilding critical infrastructure, as shelling continues. Where we can do it remotely, we do it,” Oleg Synegubov said earlier. Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process of attaining Russian citizenship for Ukrainian children who are either orphaned or currently without parental care, particularly in the partially occupied territories in the Donbas: Lysychansk is one of two cities that was hit hard today in the Luhansk oblast of Ukraine – the bombing of the other city, Sievierodonetsk, is so intense that the casualties cannot be assessed. Here are some scenes from Lysychansk today: Valentin Yumashev, the son-in-law of the former Russian president Boris Yeltsin, quit his role as unpaid adviser to Vladimir Putin last month, Reuters is reporting. Though the Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Yumashev did not immediately respond to a request for comment, Lyudmila Telen, first deputy executive director of the Boris Yeltsin Presidential Center, told Reuters that Yumashev had given up his Kremlin adviser role in April. “It was his initiative,” she said, when asked why he left the position. Another person, who spoke to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, also confirmed that Yumashev had quit in April. Yumashev, who is married to Yeltsin’s daughter, Tatyana, represented one of the few remaining links in Putin’s administration to Yeltsin’s rule – a period of liberal reforms and an opening-up of Russia towards the west. However, insiders said he did not play a major role as Putin’s adviser. Under Yeltsin, who was president from 1991 to 1999, Yumashev also served as a Kremlin adviser and later as head of the presidential administration. Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles. The scheme would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt. In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”. The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February. EU leaders failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided. Russia will stop supplying gas to the Netherlands as of tomorrow after the government-backed trader GasTerra refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. About 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures. A French journalist, Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, was killed after an evacuation car was hit near the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.” Russian troops entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, has described the fighting as “very fierce”. The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv. That is it from me, Geneva Abdul. I am handing you on to Vivian Ho. The European Union is edging towards a partial ban on Russian oil, as leaders attempt to find a compromise to placate the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has been holding up a deal on the latest sanctions against Russia. Arriving at the leaders’ summit, Orbán said ‘the pipeline solution is not bad’ but insisted his country needed guarantees that it could obtain oil from other sources if there was an ‘accident’ at the Druzhba pipeline, which runs through war-torn Ukraine. Watch Orbán here: Russia is considering paying Eurobond holders by applying the mechanism it uses to process payments for its gas in roubles, Reuters reports. The scheme, according to Reuters, would allow Moscow to pay bondholders while bypassing western payment infrastructure. Investors, however, said the move would not enable Russia to avoid a historic default on debt. The news comes days after the US decided against extending a license that had permitted creditors to receive bond payments while enabling Russia to dodge default. The Russian, finance minister, Anton Siluanov, said: As happens with paying for gas in roubles: we are credited with foreign currency, here it is exchanged for roubles on behalf of [the gas buyer], and this is how the payment takes place. The Eurobond settlement mechanism will operate in the same manner, only in the other direction. According to Reuters, the money would be channelled through Russia’s National Settlement Depository (NSD), which, unlike many Russian financial institutions, is not under western sanctions. A financial market source told Reuters Russia planned to present the scheme to investors before its next payments, on two bonds, due on 23 June. The rumours have spanned the gamut: Vladimir Putin is suffering from cancer or Parkinson’s disease, say unconfirmed and unverifiable reports; the Russian leader has survived a coup attempt; or, as some tabloids think, he is already dead and has been replaced by a body double. Photographs of Putin meeting top aides are inspected in microscopic detail: is he gripping the table in pain during a meeting with the defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, in late April? Is his puffy face a sign of steroid use, as the former foreign secretary Lord Owen claimed in March? As Russia’s war in Ukraine enters its fourth month, reports suggest that Russia’s leader may be ill. But that may be just wishful thinking for Putin’s many critics, who appear ready to embrace conspiracy theories of divine vengeance or palace coups for his unrelenting assault in Ukraine. You can read the whole piece here: In talks with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, said Russia was ready to facilitate the unhindered export of grain from Ukrainian ports, according to Reuters. The Kremlin said of Putin’s call with Erdoğan: During the discussion of the situation in Ukraine, emphasis was placed on ensuring safe navigation in the Black and Azov seas and eliminating the mine threat in their waters. Vladimir Putin noted the readiness of the Russian side to facilitate the unhindered sea transit of goods in coordination with Turkish partners. This also applies to the export of grain from Ukrainian ports. Putin added, according to Reuters, that if sanctions were lifted, then Russia could “export significant volumes of fertilisers and agricultural products”. Silos and ports across Ukraine are brimming with more than 20m metric tonnes of grain and corn that has nowhere to go, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast and the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain. Ukraine used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia invaded the country, it has been forced to export by train or via its small Danube River ports. As a result, global wheat prices leaped by 20% in March, owing to the direct impact of the war on wheat production, with the world facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition, at a time when 42 million people were already one step away from famine. Ukraine is fed up with “special solutions” and separate models for its integration into the European Union, the country’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said on Monday, Reuters reports. After a meeting with France’s foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, in Kyiv, he said: We need a clear legal affirmation that Ukraine is a part of the European integration project, and such an affirmation would be the granting of candidate status. The new US ambassador to Ukraine has arrived in Kyiv, the Guardian understands, a symbolic move after the US withdrew all diplomats from the country before the Russian invasion in February. A career diplomat who served as US ambassador to Slovakia until recently, Bridget Brink was nominated by President Joe Biden in late April and confirmed unanimously by the US Senate on 18 May. The state department has not yet officially announced Brink’s arrival in Kyiv but it was confirmed by her biography page on the US embassy website, which notes that she arrived in the city on 29 May.

Here are some of the latest developments: EU leaders have failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit gets underway in Brussels. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided.

The regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say: “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.” Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant may face the death penalty, AFP reports. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory more than a week ago. The US president, Joe Biden, has said the US will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv. Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko, who faces treason charges, has been allowed to leave the country to attend a political meeting. Poroshenko, the owner of the Roshen confectionery empire and one of Ukraine’s richest businesspeople, is being investigated for his alleged involvement in financing of Russian-backed separatists in 2014-15. Russia will cut off gas supplies to the Netherlands on Tuesday, the Dutch-backed trader GasTerra said on Monday after the company refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles, in the latest escalation of the energy payments row with the west. Gazprom Export has demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Gazprom had already cut off gas to Finland, Poland and Bulgaria after they refused to comply with the new payment terms. GasTerra, which buys and trades gas on behalf of the Dutch government, said in a statement that it had “anticipated” Russia’s moves to cut off gas and has bought “elsewhere” some of the 2 billion cubic metres of gas it had expected to receive from Gazprom through October. Around 44% of Dutch energy usage is based on gas, but only about 15% of Dutch gas comes from Russia, according to government figures. The Dutch government earlier announced the country’s plans to stop using Russian fossil fuels by the end of the year. European nations are divided over how to respond to Moscow’s demand that all payments for the gas should be made in the local currency. Germany and Italy have reportedly told their companies they could open rouble accounts to keep buying Russian gas without breaching sanctions. Despite last-minute negotiations between EU countries, leaders have failed to agree on a Russian oil import ban before the two-day summit gotunder way in Brussels, Reuters reports. While the leaders of the 27 countries will agree in principle to an oil embargo, the details of their draft conclusions are yet to be decided. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it was realistic to expect an agreement at the EU’s next summit on June 23-24, according to Reuters. The draft text, seen by Reuters and which may be revised again, would include a ban on seaborne oil imports, with pipeline oil supplied to landlocked Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to be sanctioned at some later point. “There is no compromise for this moment at all,” said Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, whose country was blocking the latest European sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine. According to Reuters, Orbán later added that Hungary would be ready to back a deal if “there are solutions for the Hungarian energy supply security, we haven’t got that now”. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who proposed the latest package of sanctions at the start of May, said “we’re not there yet”. Latvia prime minister Krisjanis Karins said: We’re getting a little bogged down in all of the details and we’re forgetting the big picture. It’s only money. The Ukrainians are paying with their lives. The rest of the draft sanctions comprising the EU’s sixth package includes EU loans worth 9bn euros (or £7.67bn), an international fund to rebuild Ukraine after the war, and work to help Ukraine move its grain out of the country and ways to curb rising energy prices.

More to come... Earlier, we reported on a French journalist killed after an evacuation car was hit near Sievierodonetsk. On Twitter, French president Emmanuel Macron said: Journalist Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff was in Ukraine to show the reality of the war. On board a humanitarian bus, alongside civilians forced to flee to escape Russian bombs, he was fatally shot. Macron added: “I share the pain of the family, relatives and colleagues of Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff, to whom I send my condolences.” The newspaper Le Parisien said Leclerc-Imhoff was 32 years old and had worked for the news channel BFMTV for six years. This morning we reported on two civilian deaths and five civilians wounded by shelling as Russian troops entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. The news of Leclerc-Imhoff’s death comes as France’s new foreign minister, Catherine Colonna, visits Ukraine. On Monday she called for an investigation into his death, Reuters reports.

stances of this drama. In a phone call with Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, on Monday, Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said the country was ready to take on a role in an “observation mechanism” between Russia, Ukraine and the United Nations. Erdoğan said peace needed to be established as soon as possible and that confidence-building steps needed to be taken, Reuters reports. Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant may face the death penalty, AFP reports a a pro-Moscow separatist official saying on Monday. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory more than a week ago after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. The Azov battalion has played a central role in Russia’s justification for its invasion, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. Officials in Kyiv have suggested they could be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials have called for them to face trial or even execution on “terrorism” charges. “The court will make a decision about them,” said Yuri Sirovatko, the justice minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic in eastern Ukraine, according to AFP. He said: For such crimes we have the highest form of punishment in the DNR – the death penalty. All the prisoners of war are on the territory of the DNR. Sirovatko added there were about 2,300 soldiers from the Azovstal steel plant among them, reports AFP. The news comes a week after the Guardian reported captured Ukrainian soldiers were being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to a unit commander’s wife. It was not immediately clear if Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov battalion, had been able to speak freely during their brief call. If you wanted evidence that finding an EU-wide agreement on a next set of sanctions against Russia was not going to be easy, then the differing lines coming from different leaders in Brussels is all you need to hear. “We will always find a compromise. There are still talks going on. As long as there are talks, I am hopeful,” Luxembourg’s prime minister, Xavier Bettel, said as he was going into their meeting this afternoon. However, Reuters reports less encouraging words from Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán. He told reporters that Hungary also needed guarantees that it could purchase oil by sea if Russian oil shipments stopped coming via the Druzhba pipeline. “What is a problem for us, and why we have to fight today, is that if something happens to the Russian oil coming by pipeline … if there is no oil coming, then we should have the right for purchases by sea,” Orbán said. “This is the guarantee we need.” The US president, Joe Biden, has said the United States will not send Ukraine rocket systems that can reach into Russia, Reuters reports. The comments followed reports that the Biden administration was preparing to send advanced long-range rocket systems to Kyiv. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said he expected the European Union to reach consensus on an oil embargo against Russia but did not give a time frame for when it may happen. “Everything I hear sounds like there could be a consensus – and sooner or later there will be,” he told reporters as he arrived for an EU summit in Brussels, according to Reuters. A quick snap from Reuters here that the Danish energy agency has said a cut-off of Russian gas to Denmark would not have any immediate impact on supply in the country. Energy firm Ørsted has warned that Gazprom could halt supply. Here are some of the latest images from the EU summit, as protesters gather outside of the European Council’s headquarters Monday morning, pleading for a full embargo on Russian oil. A French journalist has been killed after an evacuation car was hit near Sievierodonetsk, Luhansk’s regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, said in a statement issued on Monday. Earlier we reported on two civilian deaths and five civilians wounded by shelling as Russian troops entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Adding that the civilian evacuation has stopped, Gaidai said: Today our armoured evacuation vehicle was going to pick up 10 people from the area and came under enemy fire. Shrapnel from shells pierced the armour of the car, a fatal wound to the neck was received by an accredited French journalist who was making material about the evacuation, a patrol policeman was rescued by a helmet.” This morning, Gaidai said “heavy battles” were taking place as Russian troops attacked the city with all weapons and air support, and entered its south-eastern and north-eastern areas. Russia has moved troops and equipment into Russia’s Kursk region, which borders Ukraine’s north-eastern region of Sumy, to protect its citizens, Kursk’s governor, Roman Starovoyt, said during a meeting today, Russia’s Interfax reports. The governor said: Everything is aimed at ensuring the life and safety of the inhabitants of the region.” Nearly four weeks after the European Commission proposed oil sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, EU leaders are struggling to see eye to eye. Ahead of a two-day summit that begins this afternoon, leaders are attempting to clinch a deal, Reuters reports. The proposal for the EU’s sixth round of sanctions against Russia included an import ban on all Russian oil - sea-borne and pipeline, crude oil and refined products. The oil embargo could cut off one of Russia’s major revenue streams, which helps finance its military action in Ukraine. Around half of Russia’s 4.7 million barrels per day of crude exports go to the EU, according to Reuters. To go ahead, all 27 member countries must unanimously agree on sanctions. Hungary has said halting Russian oil imports would pummel its economy. Similarly Slovakia and the Czech Republic have expressed concerns, according to Reuters. All three countries, rely on the southern Druzhba pipeline from Russia for oil supplies. To come to an agreement, leaders on Monday proposed a compromise that would only ban Russian oil brought to the EU by tankers, with a temporary exemption for pipeline deliveries. But some EU leaders warned it weakened the sanctions, Reuters reports. Here’s what leaders had to say ahead of the summit: Several hours before the meeting, Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas said “I don’t think we’ll reach an agreement today”. Whereas Bulgaria’s prime minister Kiril Petkov said “I think it will pass with certain derogations”. And French president Emmanuel Macron told reporters that a long-sought-after deal was “getting closer”, AFP reports.

It blew out the glass from his windows. Three more missiles fell on a neighbouring plot but did not explode. “I was on my land when the invasion started. The Russians think we are slaves. But our guys are going to kick them out,” Shumeyko predicted. In the meantime, the 42-year-old farmer acknowledged his industry is facing a heap of war-related problems. The biggest is what to do with this season’s crop, currently growing on his 1,000-hectare estate. The wheat is due to be harvested in late June and July. Next come sunflowers in August and September. Before Russia’s offensive, Shumeyko would load the grain on to a truck. It would be transported 15 miles from his village of Velykyi Dalnyk to Odesa, Ukraine’s biggest commercial port. From there, food products continued their journey by ship across the Black Sea. Ukraine’s grain helped feed an estimated 400 million people. It went to Egypt, Tunisia and beyond. Since 24 February, however, this maritime traffic has entirely ceased. Russia has blockaded and occupied all of Ukraine’s seaports. It has seized Mariupol and Berdiansk on the Sea of Azov, which is now a de facto Russian lake, and overrun Snake Island, a strategic base, allowing it to control shipping to and from the Dardanelles strait.

It must never happen again.” She added that France would do “everything in its power” to restore peace and hopes “legal proceedings are completed as quickly as possible, so that families can see their loved ones laid to rest in proper graves”, AFP reports. Since Russia’s invasion, Colonna is the highest ranking French official to visit Ukraine. Later, she is poised to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and her counterpart Dmytro Kuleba to discuss Russia’s blockage of Ukrainian ports and global food security. Germany will remove some of the red tape involved in visa processing, making it easier for critics of the Russian government to relocate to the country. While it remains difficult to predict the number of individuals this measure will affect, those able to qualify to stay longer include human rights activists, employees of NGOs and civil society groups, and journalists who have taken a stand against the war, Reuters reports. The change, announced by an interior ministry spokesperson on Monday, will guarantee a longer stay than the existing 90 days permitted under the Schengen tourist visa. Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko, who faces treason charges, has been allowed to leave the country to attend a political meeting, Reuters reports. Poroshenko, the owner of the Roshen confectionery empire and one of Ukraine’s richest businesspeople, is being investigated for his alleged involvement in financing of Russian-backed separatists in 2014-15. In January, a Ukrainian judge blocked a prosecutor’s request for his arrest. The former president has previously denied the allegations and accused the prosecution of acting “shamefully”. Prior to Russia’s invasion, he accused his successor, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who defeated him in 2019, of seeking to discredit him politically to distract from Ukraine’s widespread problems. Poroshenko is attending a meeting of the European People’s party in Rotterdam, according to Reuters. Here are some of the latest images that have been sent to us over the newswires from Ukraine. European leaders convening in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday for an EU summit to discuss a sixth package of sanctions against Russia will not decide on imposing a cap on gas prices. According to Reuters, leaders could mandate the commission to study the issue, the commissioner for economy said. Speaking to reporters from Rome, Paolo Gentiloni said: If this is agreed among member states, the commission will act very quickly to analyse this possibility.” After weeks of conflict, a coroner in the besieged Ukrainian city of Chernihiv has become familiar with the way war mangles bodies, charting the damage caused by shrapnel, cluster bombs and bullets. Yurii Fenenko,44, dreaded the day he knew would surely come, when the body of someone he was close to was brought in. But he was not prepared for it to be someone he knew so well. It was the body of a dear friend and wife of one of my best mates. The car she was driving hit a landmine as she was trying to flee a village where she lived near Chernihiv, which had been occupied by the Russians. Read more of Lorenzo Tondo’s report from Chernihiv here: Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.” “Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech last night about the status of Sievierodonetsk. European Union members should be able to reach an agreement on a new sanctions package against Russia, including imposing restrictions on Russian oil imports, during talks being held by officials, according to EU top diplomat Josep Borrell. Zelenskiy is set to address European Union leaders at an emergency summit later today to push for new sanctions against Russia. Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed it has killed 320 more Ukrainian fighters overnight, as well as striking a shipbuilding plant and destroying 15 tanks located there. They also claim to have shot down 15 Ukrainian drones overnight. There are reports that five people have died after shelling in the centre of Donetsk by the Ukrainian military. Authorities there claim that a school was targeted. There are also reports of a large explosion in Russian-controlled Melitopol, which has been blamed on Ukrainian saboteurs. Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the military-civilian administration that has been imposed on occupied Kherson, has said that grain is being transported from there to Russia. Russia has likely suffered devastating losses amongst its mid and junior ranking officers in the conflict, according to the UK ministry of defence. The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1. Lavrov also denied speculation that President Vladimir Putin is ill. Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day”. French foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna will meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv later today to express France’s solidarity with Ukraine and offer more support for the country. Yesterday Zelenskiy visited troops in Kharkiv and toured the country’s second-largest city to see damage by Russian forces in the Ukrainian president’s first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. About 31% of the Kharkiv region’s territory is occupied by Russian forces while 5% has been liberated by Ukrainian defenders, the head of Ukraine’s Kharkiv regional military administration. Nato is no longer bound by past commitments to hold back from deploying its forces in eastern Europe, the US-led alliance’s deputy secretary general has said. Moscow itself has “voided of any content” the Nato-Russia Founding Act, by attacking Ukraine and halting dialogue with the alliance, Mircea Geoana told Agence France-Presse. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. I am handing you on to Geneva Abdul. Russia’s RIA Novosti agency is reporting that five people have died after shelling in the centre of Donetsk by the Ukrainian military. They report: According to the mayor of the city, Aleksey Kulemzin, the Armed Forces of Ukraine fired at two schools and a gymnasium, among other things. On its official Telegram channel, the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic’s territorial defence HQ has told residents: Take care of yourself and your family, try not to leave the house unnecessarily. Do not leave the shelter during the shelling. Another post on the channel says: According to updated information, as a result of the shelling of the AFU in Donetsk, the number of victims increased to 21 people: 5 were killed and 16 were injured. Among the dead is a teenager born in 2009. The claims have not been independently verified. The Kremlin has described attacks on civilian infrastructure and children’s institutions in Russian-controlled territory as “outrageous”. Russian forces have repeatedly denied deliberately targeting civilian areas in Ukraine. Ukraine’s prosecutors say they are investigating hundreds of cases of alleged war crimes against the civilian population by Russian troops. Eurovision song contest winners Kalush Orchestra have auctioned off their trophy to raise money for the Ukrainian army. The band, whose song Stefania was triumphant in Turin earlier this month, said they raised $900,000 (£713,000) by auctioning off the glass microphone, and a further $370,000 by raffling off the pink bucket hat frontman Oleh Psiuk wore during the performance. Read more here: Eurovision winners Kalush Orchestra auction off trophy for Ukrainian army Ukraine’s interior ministry has posted an update to Telegram on demining activities in the Kyiv region. They say: Sappers of the National Guard continue to demine the territory of Kyiv region, which was liberated from the occupying forces almost two months ago. During this time, the guards sappers found and disposed of about 10,500 explosive devices. However, the work continues, and in some areas there are still a lot of unexploded ordnance and mines that need to be disposed of. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued its daily operational briefing. Among the claims, which have not been indepedently verified, they say: They killed “up to 320” Ukrainian service personnel in airstrikes. Russian air defence systems shot down 15 Ukrainian unmanned aerial vehicles. Four installations of the BM-21 Grad multiple launch rocket system, 46 weapons and Ukrainian military equipment were destroyed. An ammunition depot near Novomikhailovka in the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic was destroyed. An artillery strike on a hangar on the territory of the Okean shipbuilding plant in the city of Nikolaev destroyed more than 15 Ukrainian tanks and infantry fighting vehicles. The Russian RIA Novosti news agency is carrying reports of a large explosion in Melitopol, a city in the Zaporizhzhia region that is now occupied by Russia. It quotes Vladimir Rogov, who is a member of the new military council imposed on the region, as saying: Today, at about 7.40 am, a powerful explosion was heard in the very centre of the city. Windows and walls in the houses were trembling. The city centre was filled with black smoke. RIA Novosti claim a source in the new local government says that a car exploded, parked near one of the city hall buildings in Melitopol. It is thought that a Ukrainian sabotage group were behind it. Rogov said in a Telegram message about the incident: Such attacks will not stop as long as the UGIL (Ukrainian state of Ivano-Frankivsk and Lvov) terrorist entity exists. The Zelenskiy regime hates peaceful life in Melitopol and other liberated territories. Demilitarization and Denazification must be carried out to the end in the entire post-Ukrainian space! The reports of the explosion have not been independently verified. European Union members should be able to reach an agreement on a new sanctions package against Russia, including imposing restrictions on Russian oil imports, during talks being held by officials, according to EU top diplomat Josep Borrell. Reuters reports he told broadcaster France Info: “We need to decide unanimously. There were tough talks yesterday afternoon, as well as this morning. I think that this afternoon, we will be able to offer to the heads of the member states an agreement.” European Union governments failed to reach an agreement on an embargo on Russian oil on Sunday as they seek to prepare an agreement in time for an EU summit on Monday afternoon. Asked if plans to include a ban to import Russian oil could fail over the resistance from Hungary and other eastern European states, Borrell said: “No, I don’t think so … there will be an agreement in the end.” A proposal under discussion among EU countries on Sunday evening would ban Russian oil delivered to the EU by sea by the end of the year, but exempt oil delivered by the Russian Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. “We have to take the individual circumstances of everybody into account,” Borrell said, adding that a EU-wide solution should give the three countries which accounted for 7% to 8% of Russian oil imports “more time to adjust.” This is how Reuters has summed up the latest developments in Ukraine, reporting that Russian troops have entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Regional governor Serhiy Gaidai has described the fighting as “very fierce”. Gaidai has also appeared on national television in Ukraine to say “Unfortunately we have disappointing news, the enemy is moving into the city.” Incessant shelling has left Ukrainian forces defending ruins in Sievierodonetsk, but their refusal to withdraw has slowed a massive Russian offensive across the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine. “Some 90% of buildings are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no telecommunication,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised speech. “Capturing Sievierodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupiers ... We do all we can to hold this advance.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Sunday said the “liberation” of the Donbas, an industrial region which includes Luhansk and Donetsk, was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow. A series of portraits by the award-winning British photographer Lewis Khan from the Romanian border documents the stories of mothers and children who fled Ukraine as bombs and bullets rained down on their homes. You can see our photo essay here: Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, has posted to his social media a further update about the situation in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. He writes: [Russians] are consolidating on the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk, the killed Russians are not taken away, the corpse smell filled the regional centre. Two residents were killed, five injured. [Russians] are trying to surround Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, further continue to storm the direction of the “road of life”, to cut it off. Over the past 24 hours, 14 enemy attacks have been fought back, two artillery systems have been destroyed, 11 units of combat armoured equipment and 10 enemy vehicles. Air defence units shot down two winged missiles and three Cube-type Bpla. Yesterday, the [Russians] were hard at Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. In the regional centre in the old area of the city, two were killed, five more were injured, including in a village near the city. All [now] at the hospital. About 50 houses were destroyed in the area per day. The Tass news agency is reporting that grain is being shipped from Kherson, which the Russians now occupy, to Russia. They quote Kirill Stremousov, deputy head of the military-civilian administration that has been imposed on Kherson, as saying “We have space to store (the new crop) although we have a lot of grain here. People are now partially taking it out, having agreed with those who buy it from the Russian side.” He is quoted as saying that the administration was working on the supplies of sunflower seeds to local and Russian processing plants. Ukraine has previously accused Russia of stealing its grain. Russia has likely suffered devastating losses amongst its mid and junior ranking officers in the conflict, according to the UK ministry of defence. The latest intelligence report reads: Brigade and battalion commanders likely deploy forwards into harm’s way because they are held to an uncompromising level of responsibility for their units’ performance. Similarly, junior officers have had to lead the lowest level tactical actions, as the army lacks the cadre of highly trained and empowered non-commissioned officers (NCOs) who fulfil that role in Western forces. The loss of large proportion of the younger generation of professional officers will likely exacerbate its ongoing problems in modernising its approach to command and control. More immediately, battalion tactical groups (BTGs) which are being reconstituted in Ukraine from survivors of multiple units are likely to be less effective due to a lack of junior leaders. With multiple credible reports of localised mutinies amongst Russia’s forces in Ukraine, a lack of experienced and credible platoon and company commanders is likely to result to a further decrease in morale and continued poor discipline.” Nato is no longer bound by past commitments to hold back from deploying its forces in eastern Europe, the US-led alliance’s deputy secretary general has said. Moscow itself has “voided of any content” the Nato-Russia Founding Act, by attacking Ukraine and halting dialogue with the alliance, Mircea Geoana told Agence France-Presse. Under the 1997 Founding Act, intended to reset the relationship between Russia and the Alliance, both sides agreed to work to “prevent any potentially threatening build-up of conventional forces in agreed regions of Europe, to include Central and Eastern Europe”. Geoana, speaking in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, said: They took decisions, they made obligations there not to aggress neighbours, which they are doing, and to have regular consultations with Nato, which they don’t. So I think that in fact this founding act is basically not functioning because of Russia,” he added. Russia, he said, had effectively moved away from the terms of the 1997 agreement. Now we have no restrictions to have robust posture in the eastern flank and to ensure that every square inch of Nato’s territory is protected by Article 5 and our allies.” Nato’s article 5 is the one referring to collective defence, which says that an attack on one member is an attack on all of them. Geoana did not give details of any such planned deployment, but said he anticipated “a robust, flexible and sustainable presence”. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that president Vladimir Putin is ill. Answering a question from France’s broadcaster TF1, Agence France-Presse quotes Russia’s top diplomat as saying: I don’t think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.” Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day. In comments released by the Russian foreign ministry, Lavrov said: You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches. I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours.” Putin’s health and private life are taboo subjects in Russia, and are almost never discussed in public. The “liberation” of the Donbas was an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, Russia’s foreign minister said earlier on Sunday, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov told French TV channel TF1 in an interview on Sunday. For the rest of the territories in Ukraine, he said: “I do not believe that they will be happy to return to the authority of a neo-Nazi regime that has proven it is Russophobic in essence. These people must decide for themselves.” Russia’s incursion, he said, became “inevitable” after western countries failed to heed what he described as warnings about Ukraine’s disregard for, and military attacks on, its Russian-speaking citizens. “Yes, people are being killed,” Lavrov said. “But the operation is taking so much time primarily because Russian soldiers taking part are under strict orders categorically to avoid attacks and strikes on civilian infrastructure.” French foreign affairs minister Catherine Colonna will meet Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv later today to express France’s solidarity with Ukraine and offer more support for the country. According to a statement issued by the French foreign affairs ministry, Colonna has just arrived in Ukraine to show France’s support for the Ukrainian people. Two civilians have been killed and five wounded by shelling as Russian troops entered the outskirts of the Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said in a statement issued early on Monday morning. Gaidai said “heavy battles” were taking place as Russian troops attack the city with all weapons and air support, and have entered its southeastern and northeastern areas. The enemy has used all possible weapons, uses aircraft. However, our military is firmly defending itself to prevent the enemy from entering the country. Russian shells killed two Severodon residents and wounded five others. Most of them are residents of one block in the old part of the city. They were preparing food in the yard when the shelling suddenly started. Two residents of Sirotyn were seriously injured. All the wounded received home care and are already in hospitals in Donetsk region. Overnight, at least 12 houses were destroyed in Sievierodonetsk and 18 in neighbouring Lysychansk, he added. Russian forces are transferring ammunition and equipment in large numbers to the Sievierodonetsk area, the mayor said. In its most recent operational update as of 6am this morning, Ukraine’s military appeared to confirm that Russian troops were focusing on the city’s northeastern and southeastern outskirts. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set to address European Union leaders at an emergency summit later today to push for new sanctions against Russia. EU leaders will meet in Brussels to declare their continued support for Ukraine but have so far failed to agree on a new sanctions package against Moscow. Over two days, leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to discuss how best to aid Ukraine and how to deal with the conflict’s impacts: high energy prices, an impending food shortage and the EU’s defence needs. But draft conclusions of the meeting, seen by Reuters, showed that while the EU will be generous with verbal support for the government in Kyiv, there will be little in terms of new decisions on any of the main topics. German economy minister, Robert Habeck, had a slightly more pessimistic stance on Sunday. After Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we saw what can happen when Europe stands united. With a view to the summit tomorrow, let’s hope it continues like this. But it is already starting to crumble and crumble again.” The most tangible will be the leaders’ political backing for a €9bn package of EU loans, with a small grants component to cover part of the interest, so that Ukraine can keep its government going and pay wages for around two months, according to Reuters. However, the decision will be only made later, after the European Commission makes a proposal on how to raise the money. Despite efforts since the start of May, EU governments cannot agree on the sixth package of sanctions against Moscow because one of the elements - an embargo on buying Russian oil - is not acceptable to Hungary and a big problem for Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Other elements, such as disconnecting Russia’s biggest Sberbank from the SWIFT messaging system, banning Russian broadcasters from the EU and adding more people to a list whose assets are frozen and who cannot enter the EU, are all held up by the lack of agreement on the oil ban. Officials in eastern Ukraine have said Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has been so intense that it has not been possible to assess casualties and damage, as Moscow closes in on the largest city still held by Ukraine in the Donbas. Fighting is believed to be taking place in the streets and “the entire critical infrastructure” of the city has been destroyed, according to president Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol. In Zelenskiy’s latest national address, the Ukrainian president said: As a result of the Russian strikes at Sievierodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Sievierodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Sievierodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive.” The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 145km (90 miles) south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia grinds out slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. “They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region. Regional officials reported that Russian forces were “storming” Sievierodonetsk and that fighting was taking place street by street, knocking out power and mobile phone services. Sievierodonetsk’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, said those residents remaining in the city, which had a prewar population of about 100,0, risked exposure to shelling when they left their homes to access water. Striuk has estimated that 1,500 civilians have already died either from Russian attacks or from a lack of medicine and diseases that couldn’t be treated. Hello. I’m Samantha Lock and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. European Union leaders will meet in Brussels today in an attempt to make progress on an embargo of Russian oil. Officials have so far failed to come to an agreement, debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest sanctions. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set address the summit by video link. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that president Vladimir Putin is ill. “I don’t think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment,” Russia’s top diplomat said. If you’re just waking up or dropping in to catch up on what’s been happening, here are some of the latest developments: Officials in eastern Ukraine say Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has been so intense that it has not been possible to assess casualties and damage, as Moscow’s forces close in on the largest city still held by Ukraine in the Donbas. Fighting is believed to be taking place in the streets and “the entire critical infrastructure” of the city has been destroyed, according to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol. The “liberation” of Ukraine’s Donbas region is an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said, according to a release from Russia’s foreign ministry. Zelenskiy visited troops in Kharkiv and toured the country’s second-largest city to see damage by Russian forces in the Ukrainian president’s first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers … One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation,” he said. According to local officials, more than 2,000 apartment blocks have been wholly or partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the region. About 31% of the Kharkiv region’s territory is occupied by Russian forces while 5% has been liberated by Ukrainian defenders, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration said. “We are not yet able to fully inspect some of the liberated settlements, conduct full-fledged de-mining and begin rebuilding critical infrastructure, as shelling continues. Where we can do it remotely, we do it,” Oleg Synegubov said, according to a release from the president’s office. Zelenskiy said he has fired the head of the state security service in Kharkiv for not working to defend the city, adding that “law enforcement officers” are now involved. “I came, figured out and fired the head of the security service of Ukraine of the [Kharkiv] region for the fact that he did not work on the defence of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself,” the president said in his daily national address. “On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out.” The European Union failed to agree on an embargo of Russian oil during talks on Sunday while debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions. However, diplomats said they would still try to make progress ahead of a Monday-Tuesday summit on an exemption for pipeline deliveries to landlocked Central European countries. Zelenskiy is set to speak by video link to EU leaders in Brussels on Monday. The German economy minister, Robert Habeck, raised concerns that European Union unity on new sanctions against Russia was “starting to crumble”. “After Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we saw what can happen when Europe stands united. With a view to the summit tomorrow, let’s hope it continues like this,” he told a news conference on Sunday. “But it is already starting to crumble.” Russia will continue to supply gas to Serbia, after a phone call between the Russian president and his Serbian counterpart. Aleksandar Vučić said he agreed a three-year gas supply contract with Putin, with further details to be finalised with producer Gazprom. Russia is continuing to ship gas to Europe through Ukraine, Gazprom has confirmed. The Russian gas producer said its supply via the Sudzha entry point stood at 44.1m cubic metres, up from 43.95m on Saturday. Lavrov has denied speculation that president Vladimir Putin is ill. Answering a question from France’s broadcaster TF1, Agence France-Presse quotes Russia’s top diplomat as saying: “I don’t think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.” Zelenskiy said he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it had lost since the invasion. However, he ruled out the idea of using force to win back his land. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Nato is no longer bound by past commitments to hold back from deploying its forces in eastern Europe after Moscow “voided of any content” the Nato-Russia Founding Act, the US-led alliance’s deputy secretary general, Mircea Geoana, told Agence France-Presse. Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and self-propelled howitzers from the US. “The coastal defence of our country will not only be strengthened by Harpoon missiles – they will be used by trained Ukrainian teams,” Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said. Poland has also agreed to send artillery to Ukraine," Polish state media reported.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/14/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis,2022-05-13T19:00:40Z,"Russia marks Victory Day, the last civilians leave Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks, and Ukraine prosecutors set for first war crimes trials","Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. Putin marks Victory Day Russian president Vladimir Putin led anniversary celebrations of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany on Monday, as Russian forces intensified attacks on Ukraine in one of the deadliest conflicts in Europe since the second world war. Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw reported on anniversary festivities, including a fly-past over the nine domes of St Basil’s Cathedral in Moscow with supersonic fighters, strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war. The parade came two days after Russian forces bombed a village school in eastern Ukraine, killing 60 people. Putin has repeatedly likened the war in Ukraine to the challenge the Soviet Union faced when Adolf Hitler invaded in 1941. He told Russian soldiers they were “fighting for the same thing their fathers and grandfathers did”, using his Victory Day speech to justify his invasion of Ukraine. Shaun Walker analysed Putin’s list of grievances with the west, and noted that this year the invasion of Ukraine has made his message harder to stomach, even for many of his fans. In an episode of Today in Focus, Moscow correspondent Andrew Roth told Michael Safi that the speech was revealing of Putin’s dilemma – one that could make or break his presidency and his legacy in Russia. If he escalates the conflict, he stands more chance of winning the kind of victory he initially hoped for. But should that fail, he would face humiliation. Alternatively, he could claim victory now and seek to de-escalate the conflict. But would a limited, compromised declaration of victory be regarded as anything but a retreat? Russian bombardment of Ukraine had intensified ahead of the parade, including a direct hit on a school in eastern Ukraine that killed dozens of people, Daniel Boffey and Isobel Koshiw report. Final evacuees from Mariupol ‘didn’t think we would make it’ After two months sheltering in besieged Mariupol, civilians arrived in Ukraine-held Zaporizhzhia, exhausted and with few possessions, reports Emma Graham-Harrison. The last civilians rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant complex in Mariupol reached safety in Ukrainian-held territory late on Sunday. The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200km (124 miles) took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside were interrogated. “I didn’t think we would make it out alive, so I don’t have any plans for my future,” said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant and sheltered for more than two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. “I wouldn’t have given them up even if they shot me.” The Russian soldiers refusing to fight in Ukraine When the soldiers of an elite Russian army brigade were told in early April to prepare for a second deployment to Ukraine, fear broke out among the ranks, writes Pjotr Sauer. The unit, stationed in Russia’s far east during peacetime, first entered Ukraine from Belarus when the war started. But after returning to Russia in the wake of the botched initial attack, they refused when they were told they were supposed to go back for another tour at the front. “It soon became clear that not everyone was onboard with it. Many of us simply did not want to go back,” said Dmitri, a member of the unit who asked not to be identified with his real name. “I want to return to my family – and not in a casket.” Along with eight others, Dmitri told his commanders that he refused to rejoin the invasion. “They were furious. But they eventually calmed down because there wasn’t much they could do,” he said. Dmitri’s refusal to fight highlights some of the military difficulties the Russian army has faced as a result of the Kremlin’s political decision not to formally declare war on Ukraine – preferring instead to describe the invasion, which will soon reach its fourth month, as a “special military operation”. Prosecutors set for first war crimes trials On Wednesday, Daniel Boffey and Pjotr Sauer had an exclusive story revealing that three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted in what marks a watershed moment two months into the war. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is in Ukrainian custody, appeared in a Kyiv court on Friday as the first to face trial over his alleged murder of a 68-year-old man. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of driving a stolen car with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters and then shooting dead the unarmed man on a bicycle as he was talking on his phone. Shysimarin was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The long walk to safety The aim was to be the invisible man, says Igor Pedin, 61. It was to drift, as if a ghost, with his small trolley bag of supplies and dog Zhu-Zhu, a nine-year-old mongrel terrier, through the hellscape of the besieged port city of Mariupol, out into the badlands of Russian-occupied territories and on to the relative safety of the Ukrainian-held city of Zaporizhzhia – a mere 225km walk away. Pedin sidestepped mines and crossed destroyed bridges with his dog and luggage, passing smouldering homes and weeping men and women with heartbreaking stories of death and suffering. He also had to contend with nervous, trigger-happy Russian soldiers. But miraculously he made it and has told Daniel Boffey his extraordinary story.

What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis,2022-05-20T20:00:14Z,"Mariupol, city of resistance, falls … underground life of the last child in the village … Putin micromanaging conflict, sources in west believe","Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The battle for Mariupol Peter Beaumont charted the high-profile siege of Mariupol, the key southern port city that – eventually – became a victory for the Kremlin, leaving a city in ruins and perhaps thousands of civilians dead. The battle for Mariupol came to define one of the most brutal episodes in Russia’s war against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and was viewed as one of the Kremlin’s key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. This week, Pjotr Sauer reported claims by Moscow that more than 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the Azovstal steelworks “surrendered” and had been taken to Russian-held territory. Russia said more than 900 of the soldiers had been sent to a former prison colony. It is not clear how many soldiers remain inside the plant, and Ukraine has not commented on the evacuation of the soldiers since Tuesday. The deputy commander of the Azov regiment, Capt Svyatoslav Palamar, released a video on Thursday evening in which he said he had not surrendered and remained in the steelworks. “The operation is continuing. I can’t give more information now,” Palamar said. He did not say how many other fighters were with him. Inside Russia, the fate of the evacuated soldiers is being decided. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. Monsters in the basement Daniel Boffey wrote a powerful dispatch from Kutuzivka in north-east Ukraine detailing the life spent underground of eight-year-old Tymofiy Seidov, the last child remaining in his village. He spends much of his time drawing at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light, in the corner of the otherwise almost completely dark 40-by-five-metre basement he shares with 23 others including his mum, aunt and grandmother. Tanks feature a lot in his pictures. The day of Boffey’s visit, he is working on some Dalek-like monsters that he says he remembers from a cartoon he watched on YouTube before the war. He also draws happier scenes, sometimes, of houses under the sun and rainbows in the sky. But the world outside has been out of bounds to him for months. Tymofiy’s mum, Rita, says: “Tymofiy is calm today but during the heavy fighting he would become hysterical.” Putin the colonel Defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh reported how western military sources believe Vladimir Putin has become personally involved in the war, making decisions “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The sources said they believed the Russian president was making tactical decisions in the east, helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, where last week his invading forces suffered a bloody defeat as they repeatedly tried to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces resulted in nearly 500 killed and the loss of more than 70 armoured vehicles in the disastrous attempt to cross the Siverski Donets river in broad daylight. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: “A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day-to-day activity”. Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman from King’s College London said he judged the claim about Putin’s level of involvement to be plausible: “Putin has chased the military operation, first by giving very little notice he would launch an attack and then pushing hard for quick wins. That’s particularly been the problem with the second stage of the war, in the Donbas.” This week Sabbagh also looked at Russia’s claims it was using laser warfare in Ukraine. As one expert he quoted put it: “I believe this is just a lot of hype”. Reality of war seeps through to Russians As Russia continues to hide the scale of its losses in Ukraine, more and more information has leaked out, angering the families of Russian soldiers and discouraging even previous supporters of the invasion, write Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. “I look at my government totally different since the war started,” said Tatyana Efremenko, 39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike a month ago. She is still searching for her son. “There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don’t because they would put me in prison for it.” Kyiv has said that it has the remains of thousands of Russian soldiers but Moscow won’t accept them because that would force it to admit the high death toll in the war. Criticism has even reached Russian state television. In a rare condemnation of Kremlin policy on a political talk show, defence columnist Mikhail Khodaryonok suggested that the government was in denial about the war and the chance for victory against highly motivated Ukrainian forces armed by the west. “The main deficiency of our military-political position is that, in a way, we are in full geopolitical isolation and that, however much we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us,” he said. “And it’s that situation we need to escape.” Fresh battleground emerges in Nato US president Joe Biden promised full support for the Finnish and Swedish applications to join what he called a “revived Nato”, Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg warmly welcomed them and Finland’s president Sauli Niinistö said its armed forces were one of the strongest in Europe, but one crucial problem remains: Turkey is not happy. “We have told allies that we will say no to Finland and Sweden’s Nato membership,” president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told Turkish students this week. All 30 alliance members of Nato have to approve the acceptance of a new ally. Diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour explored the reasons behind Erdoğan’s repeated opposition, which could tangle Nato up in knots for months. On Monday, Erdoğan made two key demands: that Finland and Sweden end their supposed support for the Kurdish Workers’ party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and that they lift their ban on arms exports imposed in October 2019 after the Turkish incursion in northern Syria. The Nordic political class initially appeared sceptical about Erdoğan’s seriousness. But that assessment is changing. Jonathan Eyal, the associate director of the Rusi thinktank, said Erdoğan “lives on the edge and operates through brinkmanship”. The Turkish president, Eyal noted, “has domestic reasons to be standing up to America. The economy is in tatters and his popularity is at an all-time low.” With inflation at 66.9% and facing elections next summer, there is no harm galvanising the nationalist vote, but that is not to say Erdoğan’s complaints are entirely synthetic. The Guardian asked Swedish and Finnish readers to share their thoughts on what Nato membership would mean for them, and how they felt about the Russia-Ukraine war. Here’s what they said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’: anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/putin-anarchists-join-ukraine-war-effort,2022-05-26T08:31:48Z,Activists from Kyiv and around world join state forces in fight against totalitarianism,"In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight. It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.” He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine. “His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grassroots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.” The activist left is relatively small in Ukraine, where the memory of Soviet communism lingers, and its anarchist component is even smaller. But from 1917-21 Ukraine was home to one of the world’s most famous anarchist movements, which sprung out of the power vacuum created by the fall of Tsarist Russia. Led by the anarchist Nestor Makhno, the movement argued for the rights of Ukraine’s peasantry and quickly grew in popularity under the slogans “Death to those who stand in the way of free working people” and “Power breeds parasites, long live anarchy!” At the height of the movement, self-governing communes existed across most of southern and eastern Ukraine under the protection of Makhno’s army. His base was in Huliaipole, a town in Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region, which has been frequently fought over since February. The Bolsheviks defeated Makhno’s army and he died in exile in Paris. Those at the Kyiv anarchists’ headquarters admit that these are no longer “Makhno times”. Today, the anarchist movement in Ukraine is small and a battalion acting independently would collapse on a modern-day battlefield, they say. About 100 anarchists have signed up to fight in Ukraine’s army and territorial defence forces, according to Serhiy Movchan, the group’s spokesperson. In addition, about 20 foreign anarchists have signed up, including a Russian who fled his country three years ago. Others have come to Ukraine to work as volunteer paramedics. “We have a strict screening process,” said Dmytro, who was eager to stress that the foreign volunteers differ from some of the others who have arrived in the country since February. “We don’t want people who just come here to kill; we want them to understand what they are fighting for.” Before the 24 February invasion, the anarchists – small in number – would join forces with wider leftwing activist networks. But attracting supporters faced obstacles due to the country’s experience of the Soviet era. In the name of socialism, mass murders were carried out, a man-made famine was created, and swathes of culture and history, including the Ukrainian language, were repressed. A controversial set of de-Communisation laws were passed in 2015 to deal with this legacy, but many on the left feel the wider population began to associate everything on the left with the Soviet Union. Then, under Putin’s Russia Kremlin spin doctors and their allies co-opted leftist rhetoric to create pro-Russian political parties across the former Soviet Union, including Ukraine. These parties were used to appeal to those voters who harboured nostalgia for communist times. Leaked emails in 2016 revealed how the Kharkiv regional leader of the Communist party of Ukraine, banned the previous year for promoting separatism, had received emails from the office of the former Kremlin spin doctor Vladislav Surkov on how to foment separatism and campaign for federalisation. (Since 2014 the Kremlin has been pushing for federalisation in Ukraine as Russia’s way of re-gaining leverage in national politics.) Dmytro also pointed to the “leftwing” messaging used by the Kremlin when creating the self-declared people’s republics in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Russian-backed unrecognised states in eastern Ukraine. He said that the irony is that the entities have been headed by ultra-rightists such as Igor Girkin, who promoted Russian nationalism, carried out extrajudicial killings, and banned freedom of speech and association. The recent full-scale invasion by Russia has brought another layer of mud for activists on Ukraine’s left, said Movchan. “Putin has appropriated the word anti-fascist and he exploits it to justify his war,” said Movhcan. “[Ukrainian] nationalists say if you’re anti-fascist, you’re pro-Russian, but that’s not the case.” Movchan said far-right nationalism has always failed to gain popular support in Ukraine, but moderate nationalism – which emphasises religion, language and the army – became mainstream after 2014. Many Ukrainian politicians assumed nationalist messaging in an ensuing competition to present themselves as Ukrainian patriots. This nationalism promotes conservative, non-progressive ideas and therefore presents a “big problem”, said Movchan. “I think both sides of the elite did a lot to create a situation whereby Ukrainians argue a lot about language and versions of history instead of how Kryvyi Rih Stal was privatised,” said Movchan, referring to Ukraine’s largest steelworks that was privatised in 2004 by oligarchs close to the then-president. Movchan said that this form of nationalism has given those in power a tool to ignore Ukraine’s social issues, but that people need to be clear that Ukraine’s internal problems are not to blame for the war. “The cause of the war is the Russian Federation,” said Movchan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happened in the Russia-Ukraine war this week? Catch up with the must-read news and analysis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/what-happened-in-the-russia-ukraine-war-this-week-catch-up-with-the-must-read-news-and-analysis,2022-05-06T19:00:11Z,Evacuees share horror of months in Avozstal steelworks bunker; why Putin’s shift to the east could lengthen the war; and tattoos of Ukraine resistance,"Every week we wrap up the must-reads from our coverage of the Ukraine war, from news and features to analysis, visual guides and opinion. The rush to evacuate Mariupol The last stronghold of resistance to Russia’s siege of Mariupol, the sprawling Azovstal steelworks, has come under intense bombardment this week amid speculation, as Andrew Roth reports, that Russia aims to use the city as a prop in festivities to mark Victory Day on 9 May. This week hundreds of people have been evacuated from the city to safety. Among them, Natalia Usmanova told journalists that she felt her heart would stop as Russian bombs rained down on those hiding in a Soviet-era bunker underground. Azovstal evacuees who arrived in Zaporizhzhia were emotional. “We are so thankful for everyone who helped,” said Anna Zaitseva, holding her six-month-old baby. “There was a moment we lost hope, we thought everyone forgot about us.” Elina Tsybulchenko, another evacuee who made it to safety, said: “They bombed like every second … You can’t imagine how scary it is when you sit in the shelter, in a wet and damp basement which is bouncing, shaking.” As the week ground on, fierce fighting moved inside the steelworks as more civilians fled the city on evacuation buses following weeks of brutal bombardment that have reduced much of it to rubble. Others remained trapped inside the complex. The UN described the city as a “hellscape”. Roth explained why Mariupol is so important to Russia: the city that few Russians would have imagined as a prize before the war is home to a leading iron and steelworks that played an important role in the city’s economy. It was a vibrant port with an active civil society that had withstood the Russian-backed advance in 2014, when Russian artillery came close enough to Mariupol to bombard the city’s outer districts, before being driven back. The Kremlin could be keen to take the city as a strategic point in its goals to build a broad “land bridge” to occupied Crimea, to gain access to another deep-water port that it used to transport coal, steel and grain, and as a symbolic victory – the largest city yet taken by Russia, which has failed to conquer Kharkiv or Kyiv. Russian push east stokes fears of protracted war Amid mounting fears among western officials that Russia’s war in Ukraine could drag on for months or years, the Kremlin appears to be focusing its operations around the city of Izium as part of renewed efforts to seize the entirety of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Peter Beaumont writes that the new focus of the Kremlin’s war – aimed at building the land bridge from the Russian border to Crimea and beyond – has come with a shift in tactics to a slower and more deliberate advance as the Russian military has continued to struggle with logistics and other problems in managing its campaign. The latest stage of the offensive has been marked by an increased concentration of artillery, and the use of artillery fire, to support the slowly advancing Russian troops, with a Pentagon official describing “slow and uneven” progress in fierce fighting in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. The desperate draft in Donetsk In Donetsk, the streets are empty. Emma Graham-Harrison and Vera Mironova report on the desperate and aggressive draft campaign by Russian-backed separatists controlling parts of eastern Ukraine driving many military-aged men into hiding. The separatist region backed and recognised by Russia announced its draft on 19 February, a few days before the invasion of the rest of Ukraine. To be exempt from the draft, you have to be signed off by senior government officials, who are one of the few groups to be spared the draft. In late March, pro-Russia authorities upped the age limit of the draft in Donetsk from 55 in 65, and on Saturday authorities announced mobilisation in Kherson, a region largely captured by Russia after the war began. Twice, authorities have tried to lure men out of hiding by claiming the draft was over. But when men came out of hiding, many were seized and drafted. Now, husbands, sons and brothers are living in basements and locked indoors at the homes of friends or relatives where no military-age men are registered as residents. Fleeing Moldova This week’s string of mysterious blasts in Transnistria have become a warning sign for many to get out. And as men from the Moscow-backed separatist region in Moldova are being mobilised to fight alongside Russian troops, Paula Erizanu reports of waves of people fleeing to Turkey, Poland and the Czech Republic. On Monday, government buildings were hit by what appeared to be rocket-propelled grenades. The days that followed saw blasts hitting a Russian-broadcasting radio tower and shots reportedly fired near a Russian arms depot. Transnistria, near the Ukraine border, is predominantly Russian-speaking. And the growing concern on the ground is that Moldova could become the next front of the Ukraine war. In 1992 Moldova broke away from the Soviet Union, a year after the region declared its independence. This followed a five-month war where Russian forces intervened on the side of the separatists. No country, not even Russia, has recognised the self-declared Transnistrian Moldovan Republic, but the “frozen conflict” has kept Moldova partitioned between Russia and Europe ever since. Now, many fear that last week’s explosions may be the start of a dangerous thaw. Volunteers collect the dead Isobel Koshiw and Lorenzo Tondo report on civilian Ukrainians with no previous experience in exhumation wearing gardening gloves and volunteering to collect hundreds of bodies of those executed and buried in towns bordering Ukraine’s capital. Thrust into what has been called one of the worst atrocities in Europe since the second world war, small-town police forces are relying on these ordinary civilians to help. According to Ukrainian prosecutors, more than 1,000 bodies have been recovered so far – many of whom were killed by bombs, making their remains harder to find. Tattoos of resistance Ukrainians are inking the fight for their country on to their bodies, with artists getting requests for tattoos of molotov cocktails, anti-tank missiles and even a type of bread that has become an unlikely symbol of national identity because Russians struggle to pronounce it. Emma Graham-Harrison reports that as people filtered back to Kyiv after Russian troops abandoned their attempts to seize it, tattoo artists noticed an increasing demand for art that paid tribute to this spring of tragedy and violence, and to Ukraine’s spirit of resistance. “I wanted to capture this moment,” said Mariika, a tattoo artist who now has an anti-tank hedgehog on her leg and a molotov cocktail on her arm. For several Saturdays she has joined a group of tattoo artists gathered in a Kyiv party district for a fundraising day at a nightclub, currently out of action because of the war and curfew. Anyone can turn up for a tattoo, and the price is whatever they can afford to donate to the Ukrainian armed forces.

Russia-Ukraine war: Joe Biden expresses support for right of Finland and Sweden to join Nato– as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/13/russia-ukraine-war-latest-kyiv-to-hear-first-war-crimes-trial-putin-humiliating-himself-on-world-stage-truss-says-live,2022-05-14T04:52:44Z,Ukraine president ready to speak to Putin ‘but only to him’; electricity supplier RAO Nordic says decision to suspend Finnish supply is ‘exceptional’,"Thank you for following today’s coverage of the war in Ukraine. We will be closing this liveblog but you can catch all the latest developments on our new blog launched below. It’s just after 7am in Kyiv, here’s a round up of the latest developments. Ukraine has “likely won the battle of Kharkiv”, the country’s second largest city, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. “Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv,” the US-based thinktank said. Ukrainians have also repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. British defence intelligence said Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – a formation with about 800 personnel at full strength – from the failed effort to cross the Siversky Donets River, 12 miles (20km) west of Severodonetsk. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. That news came as US president Joe Biden expressed his support for the right of Finland and Sweden “to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements” in a call with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson. The White House also said it was ‘working to clarify Turkey’s position’ after president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining Nato. The comments appeared directed at the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation. Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy says “very difficult negotiations are underway” on the evacuation of the seriously wounded and medics from Mariupol and the Azovstal steel plant, which Russian forces continue to bombard. “Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate everyone else, each of our defenders,” the president added. Earlier, the Ukrainian president reiterated an offer to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in his fullest public comments on the prospect of peace talks in weeks. “I am ready to talk to Putin, but only to him. Without any of his intermediaries. And in the framework of dialogue, not ultimatums,” he told Italy’s RAI 1 television. A Russian soldier has appeared in court accused of murdering an unarmed man on a bicycle, at the start of the first war crime trial in Ukraine since the invasion began. Vadim Shysimarin, a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is charged with the premeditated murder of a 62-year-old man. The case is scheduled to resume on Wednesday. Georgia’s breakaway region of South Ossetia will hold a referendum on joining Russia on 17 July, the region’s leader, Anatoly Bibilov, has announced. South Ossetia was at the centre of the Russian-Georgian war in 2008 after which the Kremlin recognised the territory – along with another separatist region, Abkhazia – as an independent state and stationed military bases there. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Kyiv hopes to arm a million people as the country prepares for a “new, long phase of war”. He warned that “extremely tough weeks are ahead” and that Ukraine needed “unity, cohesion, will and patience” during this difficult period. The UK has issued sanctions against a dozen members of Vladimir Putin’s family and inner circle including his long-rumoured girlfriend. The Foreign Office argued that the Russian president officially owns only modest assets, and has sanctioned the people who help support his lavish lifestyle. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for the first time since before the invasion began, the Pentagon said. Austin “urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication”, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said. The EU could agree on a phased embargo on Russian oil next week, despite concerns about supply in eastern Europe, according to diplomats and officials. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters an agreement could come as early as Monday when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. A third diplomat said there was a chance of an agreement later in the week. The lawyer for the US professional basketball player Brittney Griner said her pre-trial detention has been extended by one month. The two-time Olympic medallist was arrested in February at Moscow’s airport, allegedly in possession of vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. If found guilty, she could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. Russian soldiers were captured on CCTV shooting unarmed civilians in the back, according to footage obtained by the BBC. The film shows Russian soldiers trying to enter commercial premises neaar Kyiv in the early stages of the war before they appear to shoot a security guard and another man in the back. The alleged shootings are being investigated by Ukrainian prosecutors as a war crime. While the war rages in Ukraine, its deaf athletes have been doing the country proud in Brazil, which is currently hosting the Deaflympics. Ukraine is currently leading the medal table by a significant margin, according to this dispatch by AFP: When Rymma Filimoshkina practiced the hammer throw in the yard near her house in Mariupol at the start of the Ukraine war, her neighbours thought she was throwing a bomb. But her “weapon” isn’t one of destruction: it just won the 33-year-old deaf athlete a gold medal at the Deaflympics in Brazil. Thousands of kilometres from the conflict at home, the Ukrainian team is raking in the medals at the Olympics for the deaf, which opened on 1 May and wrap up Sunday in the southern city of Caxias do Sul. With two days left to go in the Games, Ukraine had a commanding lead in the medal table, with a total of 116 - more than double the second-place United States. “In this event, we show the world we exist: we are Ukraine, a real powerful, independent and democratic country,” said Valeriy Sushkevych, president of the Ukraine Paralympic committee. “One soldier called us and said: in between battles, we support you on TV. Your fighting spirit in sports is very important for us,” he told AFP. Ukraine has a history of punching above its weight in disabled sport. Its Paralympic program owes its success to two and a half decades of specialized schools in every region of the country for children with disabilities, who start participating in sporting programs at an early age, Sushkevych says. Ukraine finished sixth in the medal table at the Summer Paralympics in Tokyo last year, and second at the Winter Paralympics in Beijing in March, just after Russia launched its invasion. The team’s success at the Deaflympics is symbolically charged: Ukraine had finished second in the medal table at the last three editions of the event - behind Russia, which was banned from all international competitions over the invasion. “I dedicate these medals to Ukraine. I’m very proud to represent my country,” said a smiling Dmytro Levin, a 24-year-old native of Kharkiv, speaking in sign language after winning two golds and a bronze in orienteering. “I’m happy to have won this medal for Ukraine. But all I really want is peace,” said 15-year-old Sofia Chernomorova, who won bronze in badminton. Filimoshkina said she still remembers the vibrations she felt with every bomb that exploded in Mariupol, the port city devastated by relentless Russian strikes. “A lot of deaf people died because they didn’t hear the air raid sirens and went outside at the wrong time,” she said. Her teammate Julia Kysylova, who won silver in the hammer throw, said that for a long time, she was sure they would have to cancel their trip for the Games. “When the war erupted, it was impossible to train. I spent a month sheltering at home,” said the 25-year-old athlete from Nova Kakhovka, in the hard-hit southern region of Kherson. She finally managed to flee to Spain, leaving her husband behind. “It was a miracle we managed to cross the border. The trip took more than two days,” she said. “After the Games, I hope to go back home and be with my husband,” she added. “But I don’t know if that will be possible.” Russia’s annual inflation jumped to a two-decade high of 17.8% in April, fuelled by Western sanctions over Moscow’s military campaign in Ukraine, the statistics agency said on Friday, AFP reports. Since president Vladimir Putin moved troops into Ukraine on 24 February, Russia has been hit with a barrage of international sanctions, including embargoes on key exports, accelerating already high inflation. Inflation of food prices, a huge concern for Russians on low incomes, has reached 20.5% year-on-year, according to Rosstat. Pasta has gone up by 29.6%, butter by 26.1%, and fruit and vegetables by 33%. Annual inflation could reach 23% this year before slowing down next year and returning to the target of 4% in 2024, according to the Central Bank. “Looking ahead, we expect monthly increases in prices to ease further from May,” Capital Economics said. Inflation has been speeding up for months due to a number of factors including the post-pandemic recovery and high prices for raw materials. Putin’s decision to send troops to Ukraine has added sanctions and the resulting logistical difficulties as factors. Putin on Thursday said Western countries were worse hit by sanctions imposed on Moscow over Ukraine than Russia, which he insists has been resilient in the face of “external challenges”. Washington is “working to clarify Turkey’s position” after president Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed opposition to Finland and Sweden joining Nato, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki has said according to Reuters. The idea of the two nations becoming members of the transatlantic alliance had received “broad support from NATO member countries,” Psaki said. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby likewise said the United States is working to “better understand” Ankara’s stance. Turkey is a valued NATO ally; that has not changed. They have been involved and helpful in trying to get dialogue going between Russia and Ukraine ,and they have provided assistance to Ukraine. So nothing changes about their standing in the NATO alliance. Erdogan told journalists on Friday that “we do not have a positive opinion” about the two countries joining the alliance, and said they shelter “terrorist organizations.” Turkey has long accused Nordic countries, in particular Sweden, which has a strong Turkish immigrant community, of harbouring extremist Kurdish groups as well as supporters of Fethullah Gulen, the US-based preacher wanted over the failed 2016 coup. The leaders of the US and the 10-country Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) have called for an “immediate cessation of hostilities” in Ukraine and the creation of “an enabling environment for peaceful resolution”, following a summit in Washington. “We continue to reaffirm our respect for sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity. We reiterate our call for compliance with the UN Charter and international law,” the group said in a statement. We support the efforts of the UN Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful solution. We also call for the facilitation of rapid, safe and unhindered access to humanitarian assistance for those in need in Ukraine, and for the protection of civilians, humanitarian personnel, and persons in vulnerable situations. Russian president Vladimir Putin is likely to annex the occupied parts of southern and eastern Ukraine into Russia “in the coming months”, according to Katherine Lawlor and Mason Clark, analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, warning that the move could then be used to threaten Ukraine and its allies with nuclear attack. After annexation, He [Putin] will likely then state, directly or obliquely, that Russian doctrine permitting the use of nuclear weapons to defend Russian territory applies to those newly annexed territories. Such actions would threaten Ukraine and its partners with nuclear attack if Ukrainian counteroffensives to liberate Russian-occupied territory continue. Putin may believe that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would restore Russian deterrence after his disastrous invasion shattered Russia’s conventional deterrent capabilities. Putin’s timeline for annexation is likely contingent on the extent to which he understands the degraded state of the Russian military in Ukraine. The Russian military has not yet achieved Putin’s stated territorial objectives of securing all of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts and is unlikely to do so. If Putin understands his military weakness, he will likely rush annexation and introduce the nuclear deterrent quickly in an attempt to retain control of the Ukrainian territory that Russia currently occupies. If Putin believes that Russian forces are capable of additional advances, he will likely delay the annexation in hopes of covering more territory with it. In that case, his poor leadership and Ukrainian counteroffensives could drive the Russian military toward a state of collapse. Putin could also attempt to maintain Russian attacks while mobilizing additional forces. He might delay announcing annexation for far longer in this case, waiting until reinforcements could arrive to gain more territory to annex. Ukraine and its allies therefore “likely have a narrow window of opportunity to support a Ukrainian counteroffensive into occupied Ukrainian territory before the Kremlin annexes that territory,”Lawlor and Clark write. As reports suggest that Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed back Russian forces from around the country’s second largest city, Kharkiv, near the country’s north-eastern border with Russia, here are some images showing the destruction left behind: An interesting thread here on Russia’s failed Donbas river crossing from retired Australian major general Mick Ryan. In it, he notes that: This Russian river crossing has gained attention because it resulted in the loss of (probably) a battalion tactical group and some critical engineer equipment. The reality is, it is worse than that. He also says: An important aspect of assault river crossings is that they are only undertaken if absolutely necessary. The resources needed - engineers, bridges, artillery - are closely husbanded by commanders. As I already mentioned, they are really hard, especially when being shot at. Therefore, such operations normally only occur on an axis of advance that is a main effort (or about to become the main effort). This has been missed by many commentators - the Russians clearly intended to invest in this axis and throw a lot of combat power down it. Ukraine has “likely won the battle of Kharkiv”, the country’s second largest city, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Ukrainian forces prevented Russian troops from encircling, let alone seizing Kharkiv, and then expelled them from around the city, as they did to Russian forces attempting to seize Kyiv. Russian units had “generally not attempted to hold ground against counterattacking Ukrainian forces over the past several days, with a few exceptions.” Reports from Western officials and a video from an officer of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) indicate that Moscow is focused on conducting an orderly withdrawal and prioritizing getting Russians back home before allowing proxy forces to enter Russia rather than trying to hold its positions near the city. The US-based think tank said Ukraine would now likely “attempt to disrupt ground lines of communication (GLOCs) between Belgorod [in Russia] and Russian forces concentrated around [the Russian-occupied city of] Izyum, although Russia is using several GLOCs, including some further away from current Ukrainian positions than any Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely to reach soon.” Russian troops had “made no progress” with an attempted ground offensive from Izyum, it continued, adding: “We had previously hypothesized that Russia might give up on attempts to advance from Izyum, but the Russians have either not made such a decision or have not fully committed to it yet.” Meanwhile, it said, the main Russian effort was aimed at encircling the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk. Russian troops attacking from Popasna to the north made no significant progress in the last 24 hours. Russian forces coming north-to-south have failed to cross the Siverskyi Donets River and taken devastating losses in their attempts. The Russians may not have enough additional fresh combat power to offset those losses and continue the offensive on a large enough scale to complete the encirclement, although they will likely continue to try to do so. Other key takeaways included: Russian forces have likely secured the highway near the western entrance to the Azovstal Steel Plant but fighting for the facility continues. Russian forces in Zaporizhia Oblast are likely attempting to reach artillery range outside Zaporizhia City. Ukrainian forces are reportedly attempting to regain control of Snake Island off the Romanian coast or at least disrupt Russia’s ability to use it. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over from my colleague Sam Levin. First, a bit more from Zelenskiy’s latest nightly address, in which he warned that the war and Russia’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports were “provoking a large-scale food crisis”. Russian officials are also openly threatening the world that there will be famine in dozens of countries. And what could be the consequences of such a famine? What political instability and migration flows will this lead to? How much will you have to spend then to overcome the consequences? These are the questions that need to be answered by those who are delaying sanctions on Russia or trying to postpone aid to Ukraine. His warning came as G7 foreign and agriculture ministers were meeting in Germany to discuss ways of breaking the Russian blockade of grain exports. Zelenskiy also claimed that Russia had lost almost 27,000 soldiers, “many of them young conscripts”, and that Ukraine had downed a 200th Russian military aircraft. Russia had also “lost more than three thousand tanks, armored combat vehicles, a large number of conventional military vehicles, helicopters, drones and all its prospects as a state.” And why all this? For a monument to Lenin to stand in the temporarily occupied Henichesk for a little longer? There is no other result for Russia and there will not be any. The Guardian is not able to verify Ukraine’s claims regarding Russian losses and Moscow has provided very little detail. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said on Friday that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining the Nato. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Kyiv hopes to arm a million people as the country prepares for a “new, long phase of war”. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. The US is sending 10,500 new troops to Europe to replace soldiers who were earlier deployed, the Pentagon said on Friday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said talks with Russia on getting wounded defenders out of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol were very complex and that negotiations were underway. Ukrainians have repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. Georgia’s breakaway region of South Ossetia will hold a referendum on joining Russia on 17 July, the region’s leader announced on Friday. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said talks with Russia on getting wounded defenders out of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol were very complex, adding Kyiv was using influential intermediaries, Reuters reported, citing his late night address: Russian forces have been constantly bombarding the steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, the last bastion of hundreds of Ukrainian defenders in a city almost completely controlled by Russia after more than two months of a siege. Ukraine, saying there is no military solution to the standoff, has proposed evacuating 38 of the most severely wounded defenders. If Moscow allows them out, Kyiv says it will release a number of Russian prisoners of war. “At the moment very complex negotiations are under way on the next phase of the evacuation mission – the removal of the badly wounded, medics. We are talking about a large number of people,” Zelenskiy said in his address. “Of course, we are doing everything to evacuate all the others, every one of our defenders. We’ve already involved everyone around the world who could be the most influential intermediaries,” he added, without giving details. Oleksandra Ustinova, a member of the Ukrainian parliament, spoke to reporters in Washington DC today and said the crisis on the battlefield was now “far worse” than it was at the start of the war, CNN reports. Ustinova said “it is hell” on the frontlines, the news network reported: “We keep losing many more men now than it was at the beginning of the war.” She was speaking at a German Marshall Fund roundtable. She also called on the US to supply fighter jets and air defense systems, saying, according to CNN: If we had howitzers two months ago, Mariupol would not happen because they wouldn’t be able to surround like they did, to surround the city and literally destroy it ... For us, time means lives, thousands of lives. We’ve been hearing that it has been unprecedented how fast everything is moving and how fast the decisions are taking. But there has never been a war since World War Two like that. And unfortunately, we keep asking here to take the decisions faster.” Reuters has a dispatch from Dergachi, on the outskirts of Kharkiv, where firefighters were dousing smoldering wreckage after, according to local officials, a Russian missile attack hit the House of Culture, which was used to distribute aid supplies. Volunteers inside were attempting to salvage packages of baby diapers and formula, the news agency reported on Friday. The mayor, Vyacheslav Zadorenko, told Reuters: I can’t call it anything but a terrorist act. They wanted to hit the base where we store provisions and create a humanitarian catastrophe.” The mayor also said that another missile had slammed into the building on Thursday and wounded a clinic staff member and killed a young couple in their home. Some more on the latest developments: The US is sending 10,500 new troops to Europe to replace soldiers who were earlier deployed, the Pentagon’s spokesperson John Kirby also announced in his briefing today. He said the deployments were “one for one unit replacements” and that the turnovers would happen in the coming weeks and into the summer: “It will be a rotation over time.” Kirby explained: These are not permanent moves. These moves are designed to respond to the current security environment. Moreover these forces are not going to fight in Ukraine. They are going to support the robust defense of Nato allies. Still, as the New York Times noted, the move suggests that the temporary expansion of troops is likely becoming more permanent. Ukrainian military authorities loaded the bodies of Russian soldiers onto refrigerated rail cars on Friday, saying they were prepared to return the bodies to Russia in accordance with international law, Reuters reports. The authorities loaded the bodies after fighting in the Kyiv and Chernihiv regions. From the news agency: Volodymr Lyamzin, the head of Ukraine’s civil-military cooperation, said his country was acting in accordance with international law and was ready to return the bodies to Russia. “According to the norms of international humanitarian law, and Ukraine is strictly following them, after the active phase of the conflict is over, sides have to return the bodies of the military of another country, “Ukraine is ready to return the bodies to the aggressor”, he said. Lyamzin said there were several refrigerator trains stationed in different regions across Ukraine where the bodies of Russian soldiers were being kept. Several hundred bodies were being stored at a facility on the outskirts of Kyiv filmed by Reuters. The Russian army has continued its strategic offensive in the country’s east, attacking new villages and towns, the Ukrainian army said in its daily operational statement today, the Associated Press reports: Russian troops were engaging their Ukrainian opponents with live fire near the Rubezhnoye settlement, near the strategic city of Severodonetsk in Ukraine’s Donbas, the Ukrainian military’s general staff said in a Facebook post. Analysts say that fighting in the Sevedononetsk area is critical to securing control over the Donbas, Ukraine’s eastern industrial heartland, which is made up of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. On Friday, Russian troops unsuccessfully stormed the towns of Zolote and Kamyshevakha, the Ukrainian military said. It added that Moscow’s forces were firing artillery at the strategically important settlements of Kamenka and Novoselivka. The military also said that Russia continued shelling Ukrainian positions in Mariupol, near the Azovstal steel plant where Kyiv’s troops continue to hold out. The accuracy of the claims could not be immediately verified, the AP noted. The Pentagon spokesperson, John Kirby, urged Congress to pass the $40bn supplemental aid package for Ukraine during a briefing on Friday. He said 19 May was a critical deadline, CNN reported: 19 May is the day we really, without additional authorities, we begin to not have the ability to send new stuff in. By the 19th of May, it’ll start impacting our ability to provide aid uninterrupted.” Kirby said: “We continue to urge the Senate to act as quickly as possible so that we don’t get to the end of May and not have any additional authorities to draw upon ... We’ve been moving at a fairly fast clip here both in terms of the individual packages that have been approved and how fast that stuff is getting into Ukrainian hands ... We’d like to be able to continue that pace for as long as we can.” Democrats and Republicans had both supported the aid package this week, but Rand Paul, the GOP senator and libertarian from Kentucky, single-handedly blocked its approval: The United States accused Russia of using the UN Security Council to spout disinformation and conspiracy theories about biological weapons in Ukraine, to distract from its invasion of the country, the Associated Press reported. US deputy ambassador Richard Mills called the Russian claims of alleged US involvement in a biological weapons program “categorically false and ludicrous”. He warned the council Friday that Moscow’s actions follow a pattern of accusing others of violations it has perpetrated or intends to perpetrate, adding that they need to be watched closely “for the possibility of a false flag chemical or biological attack by Russia’s forces”. UN deputy disarmament chief Thomas Markram reiterated to the council what his boss said at council meetings on 11 March and 18 March on similar Russian allegations: the United Nations is not aware of any biological weapons program in Ukraine. Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia had earlier said in the meeting that he had called for a third council meeting because his government continues to receive “very worrying documentary evidence” that the US defense department is directly involved in carrying out “dangerous biological projects that look like a secret biological military program” in Ukraine. Lloyd Austin, the US defense secretary, held a call with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu on Friday in which he called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, the Pentagon said. During the call Austin also “emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication”, the Pentagon said. It was the first time Austin had spoken with Shoigu since 18 February, six days before Russia invaded Ukraine. The New York Times reported that the call came “at the initiative of the American side”. “What motivated them to change their mind and be open to it, I don’t think we know for sure,” a senior Pentagon official told the Times. The hourlong conversation was “professional”, the Times reported, but broke no new ground. “The call itself didn’t specifically solve any acute issues or lead to a direct change in what the Russians are doing or saying,” the official told the Times. He said Austin hoped the call would “serve as a springboard for future conversations”. The call came after Republican US senator Rand Paul blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill for Ukraine on Thursday. The bill will be taken up again next week. “Difficult negotiations” are taking place to remove Ukrainian defenders holed up under the Azovstal steelworks in besieged Mariupol, CNN reported. Pavlo Kyrylenko, head of Donetsk region military administration, told CNN that attempts to save the fighters were ongoing. “Difficult negotiations are underway, and they are still going on at this time, in order to save the defenders – gradually – because the Russian Federation is trying to dictate its conditions and requirements as much as possible. Therefore, in the first place, it will be seriously wounded fighters,” he said. Kyrylenko said that Russians continue to bombard Avozstal. “These are heavy, vacuum, high-explosive bombs,” he said. “We have to talk about it only when people will be safe. Only then we shall give any comments. Negotiations are ongoing and they are really very difficult. Because, first, the Russian Federation always changes them [the conditions]. And even those agreements that are reached are not a 100% agreement with Russia,” Kyrylenko said. Consumer inflation in Russia accelerated in April to 17.83% in year-on-year terms, its highest level since January 2002, Reuters reported. Data released showed inflation was boosted by the volatile rouble and unprecedented western sanctions, which have disrupted logistics chains. But monthly inflation slowed to 1.56% in April from 7.61% in March, when it staged the biggest month-on-month increase since January 1999, data from the federal statistics service Rosstat showed. Inflation in Russia has accelerated sharply after Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. High inflation has been the key concern among households for years as it dents living standards, a fall which this year will be aggravated by a steep economic contraction. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukrainians have repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the Siversky Donets River, 12 miles (20km) west of Severodonetsk, losing armour and bridging equipment. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Kyiv hopes to arm a million people as the country prepares for a “new, long phase of war”. He warned that “extremely tough weeks are ahead” and that Ukraine needed “unity, cohesion, will and patience” during this difficult period. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. The Finnish grid company, Fingrid, said trade in electricity imported from Russia would be suspended “for the time being” due to difficulties in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market, but insisted there was “no threat to the adequacy of electricity in Finland”.

rial in Ukraine since Vladimir Putin invaded the country. Vadim Shysimarin, a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is charged with the premeditated murder of a 62-year-old man. The case is scheduled to resume on Wednesday. The UK has issued sanctions against a dozen members of Vladimir Putin’s family and inner circle including his long-rumoured girlfriend. The Foreign Office argued that the Russian president officially owns only modest assets, and has sanctioned the people who help support his lavish lifestyle. Britain and Norway have signed a new joint declaration on enhancing cooperation between the two countries. Boris Johnson met his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Gahr Støre, in London on Friday, where both leaders “underscored their full support for any sovereign choice made by Nordic partners to enhance their security”, a Downing Street statement said. US president, Joe Biden, spoke with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in call today. Biden expressed his support for the right of both Nordic countries “to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements”, the White House said. Niinistö said he discussed his country’s “next steps towards Nato membership” in the call. Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining the Nato. He said that Turkey was “currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this”. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for the first time since before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the Pentagon said. Austin “urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication”, the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said. The EU could agree on a phased embargo on Russian oil next week, despite concerns about supply in eastern Europe, according to diplomats and officials. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters an agreement could come as early as Monday when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. A third diplomat said there was a chance of an agreement later in the week. The lawyer for the US professional basketball player Brittney Griner said her pre-trial detention has been extended by one month. The two-time Olympic medallist was arrested in February at Moscow’s airport, allegedly in possession of vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. If found guilty, she could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleagues. I’ll be back on Monday. Thank you for reading. US president Joe Biden spoke with the leaders of Sweden and Finland today to show his support “for Nato’s open door policy” and for the right of both Nordic countries “to decide their own future, foreign policy, and security arrangements”, the White House said. Biden spoke with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, to discuss the “close defence and security cooperation” between the countries as well as their efforts “aimed at strengthening translatlantic security”, the White House said in a statement. The leaders also discussed the “close partnership” among the countries across a range of global issues, and “reiterated their shared commitment to continued coordination” to help Ukraine, it said. Ukraine’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, said Kyiv hopes to arm a million people as the country prepares for a “new, long phase of war”. In a Facebook post published earlier today, Reznikov said: We are entering a new, long phase of the war. To win it, we must plan resources carefully, avoid mistakes and project our strength in such a way that the enemy ultimately breaks. Reznikov thanked the British defence secretary, Ben Wallace, for his support to increase assistance for Kyiv, as well as American partners, including his US counterpart, Lloyd Austin. Ukraine’s goal is to “restore our sovereignty and territorial integrity within the internationally recognised borders”, he said. Reznikov added that he was “focusing on the need to provide for one million people who will be facing the enemy”. He warned that “extremely tough weeks are ahead” and that Ukraine needed “unity, cohesion, will and patience” during this extremely difficult period. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said he discussed his country’s “next steps towards Nato membership” in a call with his US counterpart, Joe Biden, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, today. Andersson also tweeted about the call: The call lasted about 40 minutes, the White House said. The call came at about midday on Wednesday. There had been “chemical poisoning” after a blast and patients needed collecting, Emma Graham-Harrison and Kateryna Semchuk report. Fears of a Russian chemical weapons attack have haunted Ukraine almost since the war began. And as the volunteer medics in Sloviansk pulled on the ageing gas masks and plastic overalls that were their only protection, they wondered if this was it. They set off anyway, inured to personal risks after weeks of driving through shelling to patch up the men and women injured on one of the most intensely fought-over sections of the frontline. “We got a call saying there was a yellow-brown cloud after the hit, and yellow-white flakes in the air like snow. The soldiers immediately started having breathing problems,” said Vit, a paramedic who asked to go only by his nickname, which refers to his peacetime role as mayor of a small town. He was worried about being captured and tortured by Russian troops who were just a few miles away. The ambulance team listened to the warning and then went to get the choking soldiers. Like the troops they support, they are supplementing limited, outdated equipment with courage and determination. After dropping off their patient, who had gone into spasms in the ambulance, they were told the gas came not from chemical weapons but from a chemical plant that had been hit by Russian munitions. But if the fear of one particular horror was put on hold for a moment, the other terrors of this war are drawing closer to this city in Donbas, less than 20 miles behind the frontline. Read the full article: Trial by fire: volunteer medics brave Russian shells in Donbas Italy would be “very happy” to support Nato membership for Finland and Sweden, the Italian foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, said. Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Di Maio said: We as Italy will be very happy to welcome these two countries in this great alliance that defends its member countries and … which has guaranteed peace for decades. Russia will suspend electricity supplies to Finland from 1am on Saturday the supplier, RAO Nordic, said, amid rising tensions over Helsinki’s bid to join Nato. RAO Nordic, a subsidiary of the Russian state energy holding Inter RAO, said in a statement that it was “forced to suspend the electricity import”, starting from 14 May. RAO Nordic “is not able to make payments for the imported electricity from Russia”, the statement said. It added: This situation is exceptional and happened for the first time in over 20 years of our trading history. The Finnish grid company, Fingrid, said trade in electricity imported from Russia would be suspended “for the time being” due to difficulties in receiving payments for electricity sold on the market. Fingrid added: There is no threat to the adequacy of electricity in Finland. It said that power from Russia accounted for some 10% of Finland’s total power consumption, adding: Missing imports can be replaced in the electricity market by importing more electricity from Sweden and partly also by domestic production. Finnish leaders yesterday declared the country must apply to join the Nato alliance “without delay”. In response, the Kremlin said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat, and Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow would be “forced to take reciprocal steps, military-technical and other”. The EU could agree on a phased embargo on Russian oil next week, despite concerns about supply in eastern Europe, according to diplomats and officials. A senior EU diplomat told Reuters “there will be a deal”, while a second senior diplomat said an agreement could come as early as Monday when EU foreign ministers meet in Brussels. A third diplomat said there was a chance of an agreement later in the week. One diplomat said: This is going to be decided at the highest political level, between Budapest and Brussels. I am optimistic. The embargo deal was first proposed by the European Commission in early May but dependence on Russian oil in Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia has posed the biggest obstacle. Hungary has already obtained an exemption until the end of 2024, as has Slovakia, and the Czech Republic until mid-2024. More on the US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, who also spoke to his British counterpart, Ben Wallace, to discuss the next steps to help Ukraine, including military aid. Wallace issued a statement after meeting Austin in talks held in the US: We will continue to work with unity and resolve to provide Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself against Russia’s unprovoked invasion. The pair discussed “the next steps to provide defensive support for Ukraine, as well as Aukus (a defence pact between Australia, the US and Britain), the future of Nato, and other aspects of our shared security”, Wallace said. The US defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, spoke to his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, for the first time since before Moscow’s troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February, the Pentagon said. The Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said in a statement: On 13 May, secretary of defence Lloyd J. Austin III spoke with Russian minister of defence Sergey Shoygu for the first time since 18 February. Austin “urged an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine and emphasised the importance of maintaining lines of communication”, Kirby added. The UK has issued sanctions against a dozen members of Vladimir Putin’s family and inner circle, including his long-rumoured girlfriend, arguing that given the Russian president officially owns only modest assets, these are the people who help support his lavish lifestyle. The Foreign Office announcement means asset freezes and travel bans will be imposed on, among others: Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, Putin’s former wife; Alina Kabaeva, a media executive and the Russian president’s presumed partner; and Anna Zatseplina, Kabaeva’s grandmother. The Foreign Office statement noted that Putin’s official assets ran to little more than a small flat in St Petersburg and two Soviet-era cars, despite his very obvious enormous personal wealth, including a yacht and the vast Putin’s Palace mansion on the Black Sea coast. The sanctions targeted what the statement called a “wallet” of relatives and associates. The statement said: “Putin relies on his network of family, childhood friends, and selected elite who have benefited from his rule and in turn support his lifestyle. Their reward is influence over the affairs of the Russian state that goes far beyond their formal positions.” Those named in the latest sanctions comprise seven family members and five people listed as financiers of Putin’s lifestyle. Kabaeva, a former Olympic rhythmic gymnast, holds several powerful positions and has long been rumoured to be Putin’s girlfriend. She chairs the board of Russia’s National Media Group, which controls several television stations. Zatseplina is associated with Gennady Timchenko, a billionaire with close links to Putin. Kabaeva, who is originally from Tashkent in Uzbekistan and won gold in the 2004 Athens Olympics, spent more than six years as an MP for Putin’s United Russia party. In 2014, she stepped back from politics to begin her role with National Media Group, despite her apparent lack of relevant experience beyond hosting a TV chat show. Ocheretnaya and Putin divorced in 2014, but she had since, the statement said, “benefited from preferential business relationships with state-owned entities and exhibited significant unexplained wealth”. The other family members issued with sanctions are Igor Putin, a businessman and cousin of the president; Mikhail Putin, another businessman believed to be related to the president; Roman Putin, who is Igor Putin’s son and runs a consulting firm; and Mikhail Shelomov, a business owner and Putin’s first cousin, once removed. Kyiv will see a relaxing of curfew hours from Sunday onwards, the city’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, announced on Telegram. From Sunday, the curfew will begin an hour later, from 11pm. It will continue to last until 5am. Public transport will also run for longer hours from Monday, Klitschko said. The mayor said: Subway – from 6am to 10pm. Ground public transport – from 6am to 10.30pm. Observe the curfew rules. And also – do not neglect air raid signals! Threat of missile attacks on Kyiv remains. Britain and Norway have signed a new joint declaration on enhancing cooperation between the two countries, just days after the UK’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, travelled to Sweden and Finland to pledge his support against potential Russian threats. Johnson met his Norwegian counterpart, Jonas Gahr Støre, in London today, where both leaders “underscored their full support for any sovereign choice made by Nordic partners to enhance their security”, a Downing Street statement said. The statement continued: The prime minister and Prime Minister Støre agreed that neither Nato nor the Nordic region posed a threat and that the longstanding policy of ‘high north, low tension’ had created decades of stability and prosperity for the area. Støre told broadcasters that the pair discussed energy and climate policy, the need to provide support to Ukraine, as well as their cooperation on energy and carbon capture and storage. He said it was a “historic” time for his region, with Finland potentially joining the Nato alliance. The lawyer for the US professional basketball player Brittney Griner said her pre-trial detention has been extended by one month. The two-time Olympic medallist was arrested in February at Moscow’s airport, allegedly in possession of vape cartridges containing oil derived from cannabis. If found guilty, she could face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. The Biden administration has said Griner,31, has been wrongfully detained and has assigned diplomats to work on her release. Griner appeared at the hearing in a court in Khimki just outside Moscow, handcuffed and wearing an orange hoodie with her face held low. There has been a little bit of Finnish reaction to those comments by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. He said that Turkey was “currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this”. At the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting in Germany, Reuters is quoting Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto as saying that issues need to be taken step-by-step and that the process needs patience. He said that he would be meeting Turkey’s foreign minister in Berlin tomorrow. Kremlin press spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has given a read-out from Russia’s security council meeting today, where he says Russian president Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Ukraine and potential threats from the entry of Finland and Sweden into Nato, Russia’s RIA news agency reports. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan remarked to journalists after leaving Friday prayers in Istanbul that Turkey would not welcome either Sweden or Finland joining the Nato. “We are currently following developments regarding Sweden and Finland, but we don’t feel positively about this,” he said. “We don’t want to commit a mistake,” he added. “Scandinavian countries are like guesthouses for terrorist organisations. To go even further, they have seats in their parliaments too.” Erdoğan’s comments were primarily directed at the militant group the Kurdistan Workers party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, although they appeared to encompass the communities of Kurdish origin in Scandinavia as a whole. Accession to Nato requires consensus from all member countries. Sweden has a large Kurdish diaspora, with the community considered to be one of the largest outside of the Middle East. Prominent Swedish citizens of Kurdish origin currently include six members of parliament. The Turkish authorities are yet to provide any evidence for their claims that the parliamentarians in question have links with the PKK or similar groups outside Sweden. The Kurdish-speaking population of Finland was estimated at just over 15,000 people as of 2020, less than 1% of the population. Turkey has been a Nato member since 1952 and its membership remains a cornerstone of its foreign policy towards western countries. Despite this, Turkey recently decided to withdraw from a scheduled Nato military exercise in Athens in May due to disagreements with Greece. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsperson, Lyudmyla Denisova, said more than 210,000 children were among 1.2 million Ukrainians who Kyiv says have been deported against their will. Speaking on national television, Denisova said: When our children are taken out, they destroy the national identity, deprive our country of the future. They teach our children there, in Russian, the history that (Russian president Vladimir) Putin has told everyone. Denisova did not provide evidence to support these figures, and it has not been possible to independently verify them. Ukraine has asked G7 countries to seize Russian assets and hand them to Kyiv to help rebuild the country, its foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said. Speaking to reporters as G7 foreign ministers met in northern Germany, Kuleba added that he hoped Hungary would agree with EU partners on an embargo on Russian oil. Kuleba said: Canada has already done this and I have a feeling that others will reach that point sooner rather than later. We are talking about hundreds of billions of dollars. Russia must pay. Sweden has come closer to reversing its decades-long policy of military non-alignment, after a security policy review concluded that joining Nato would have a “deterrent effect” on the risk of conflict in northern Europe. Swedish membership to Nato would “raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a deterrent effect in northern Europe”, the report said. It stopped short of offering a concrete recommendation but noted that it was “not realistic to develop bilateral defence alliances outside existing European and Euro-Atlantic structures”. The report added: Within the framework of current cooperation, there is no guarantee that Sweden would be helped if it were the target of a serious threat or attack. The report paves the way for Sweden to announce a bid for Nato membership, and comes after Finnish leaders said they believed Finland should join Nato “without delay”. The Swedish foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Finland’s position would affect Sweden and “needed to be considered”. She also noted that both Finnish and Swedish Nato memberships would be considered “negative” by Russia. Linde told reporters that Sweden did not anticipate a “conventional military attack” in reaction to a potential application, but acknowledged that the government has not ruled out “an armed assault against Sweden”. Russian retaliatory measures against Sweden “cannot be ruled out during a transition period”, the report continued, citing “cyberattacks and other forms of hybrid attacks”. Russia would be able to carry out “limited acts of violence” against Sweden, such as “sabotage by Russian special forces units or operations using long-range weapons”. Russia is advising its citizens against travelling to the UK its foreign ministry said. The ministry said: Taking into account the extremely unfriendly course of the UK towards our country, in order to avoid financial losses and other possible problems, we recommend that Russian citizens refrain, if possible, from travelling to the UK and trying to obtain British visas. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has reiterated an offer to hold direct talks with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, in the Ukrainian president’s fullest public comments on the prospect of peace talks in weeks. Russia’s withdrawal from Ukraine should be a starting point for any discussions between the two leaders, Zelenskiy told Italy’s RAI 1 television, Reuters reports. Zelenskiy said: As president, I am ready to talk to Putin, but only to him. Without any of his intermediaries. And in the framework of dialogue, not ultimatums. Ukraine and Russia have not held face-to-face talks since 29 March. Interfax news agency has quoted Moscow’s chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky, as saying peace talks were being held remotely. Zelenskiy also ruled out suggestions that Ukraine should make concessions for the sake of securing a peace agreement that would allow Putin to save face, adding that Ukraine would not compromise over its territorial integrity. He said: Get out of this territory that you have occupied since February 24. This is the first clear step to talking about anything. Russia said it expelled 10 Romanian diplomats in response to similar expulsions by Bucharest, its foreign ministry said. In a separate statement, the ministry said a member of the Bulgarian embassy was also being expelled. Germany says it has started training Ukrainian soldiers in the use of the Panzerhaubitze (PzH) 2000 artillery system this week. The PzH 2000 howitzer is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been speaking to reporters during his regular briefing. Referring to a report in a Finnish newspaper that Russia may cut gas supplies to Finland as soon as today, Peskov said it was “most likely” “another newspaper hoax”. Iltalehti reported yesterday that Finnish politicians had been warned that Russia could halt gas supplies to its neighbour on Friday. The newspaper cited unnamed sources and did not say where the warning came from. Peskov said there were no plans to cut Finland off from gas supplies today, adding that Gazprom remained a reliable gas supplier, Reuters reports. He also hit back at calls by Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, to “root out” Russia’s “monstrous ideology”. In a column for Britain’s Telegraph newspaper on Tuesday, Morawiecki said the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, was more dangerous than either Adolf Hitler or Josef Stalin because of the advanced weapons at his disposal. Peskov told reporters: This is the quintessence of that hatred towards Russians that has regrettably, like a metastasis, infected the entire Polish leadership and, in many ways, Polish society. He said Morawiecki’s “shocking” statement was “hysterical and unacceptable”. Russian president Vladimir Putin held a phone call with German chancellor Olaf Scholz, in which Putin “outlined in detail the logic and main objectives of the special military operation”, the Kremlin said on Friday. According to the Kremlin’s readout of the call, Putin also spoke about the “measures being taken to ensure the safety of civilians” during what the Kremlin calls its “special military operation” in Ukraine. The Kremlin further said that Putin drew attention to the “gross violations” committed by Ukrainian militants “professing the Nazi ideology”. The Russian leader added that the current Russian-Ukrainian negotiations were “effectively blocked” by Kyiv. During the conversation, the leaders agreed to hold further talks soon, the Kremlin said. A Russian soldier has appeared in the dock at the first war crime trial of Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine. The defendant, who arrived at Kyiv’s small district court No 3 in a grey tracksuit and handcuffs, is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is in Ukrainian custody charged with murdering a 62-year-old man. It was a preliminary hearing and a first date for trial has been set for 18 May. Shysimarin’s lawyer said his client had confessed to the killing of the victim but that he had not yet discussed whether he would plead guilty. Shysimarin spoke briefly to confirm his name and that he understood the charges against him. It is alleged that Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. The name of the 62-year-old victim was not made public. Germany’s agriculture minister, Cem Özdemir, described grain theft by Russia in eastern Ukraine as “repugnant” as G7 countries met to discuss the impact of the war on the global food supply. Özdemir was speaking to reporters at the start of a meeting in Stuttgart with colleagues from G7 countries, Ukraine, the EU, the OECD and the UN’s food and agricultural agency, Reuters reports. Özdemir said: This is an especially repugnant form of war that Russia is leading. Russia was “stealing, robbing, taking for itself grain from eastern Ukraine,” Oezdemir said, describing it as an “economic war”. Ukraine’s agriculture minister, Mykola Solsky, said his country was in a “very difficult situation” with regard to grain exports, adding: We cannot get away from the fact that the harvest will be smaller than last year. Britain announced its latest round of sanctions targeting the Russian president’s financial network, including his ex-wife, family and inner circle. The sanctions are aimed at the “shady network propping up Putin’s luxury lifestyle”, British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in a statement. The 12 new names added to the British sanctions list include the former first lady of the Russian Federation and ex-wife of Putin, Lyudmila Ocheretnaya. Mikhail Shelomov, a Russian business owner and the leader’s first cousin, once removed, has also been targeted. Several other relatives of Putin holding executive positions at major Russian firms like Gazprom have also been sanctioned. They face asset freezes and travel bans. Truss’ statement read: We are exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin’s luxury lifestyle and tightening the vice on his inner circle. We will keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin’s aggression until Ukraine prevails. Putins’ official assets are modest, according to the UK Foreign Office, with his lifestyle “funded by a cabal of family, friends and elites”. Britain’s sanctioned list now includes more than 1,000 individuals and 100 entities. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you again today.

The UK’s Ministry of Defence has said the failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river by Russian forces in the Donbas showed the pressure Russian commanders were under. Ukrainian military forces released footage on Thursday that they say shows destroyed Russian military vehicles and a pontoon bridge in eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian forces, the images were taken along the Siverskyi Donets River. The first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck the Kremenchug oil refinery in central Ukraine, destroying its production capacity and fuel tanks. Ukraine says it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov said “the night was relatively calm” in the region. However he added that in Dergachi “the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building”, and that in Shebelinka “a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and five others were injured.” The Ukrainian counteroffensive around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv is “starting to look very similar to the counteroffensive that ultimately drove Russian troops away from Kyiv and out of western Ukraine entirely”, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. Swedish membership of Nato would have a stabilising effect and would benefit countries around the Baltic sea, Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde said today, the day after neighbour Finland committed to applying to join the 30-nation alliance. The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said that the European Union would provide another €500m (£425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil. British foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was vital to keep up the pressure on Russia by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and imposing further sanctions. “It is very important at this time that we keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and by increasing the sanctions.” That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. Léonie Chao-Fong will continue to bring you the latest developments. The first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine has opened in Kyiv in a watershed moment. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old Russian commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, allegedly killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka while fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine. Shysimarin, who has been held in Ukrainian custody, is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles came under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead a 62-year-old unarmed man who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The crime is said to have happened “dozens of metres” from the victim’s house and was committed using an AK-74 rifle. A spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said before the trial opened: “Prosecutors and investigators of the SBU [Ukrainian secret services] have collected enough evidence of his involvement in violation of the laws and customs of war combined with premeditated murder. For these actions, he faces 10 to 15 years in prison or life in prison.” Two other cases are likely to be heard in court within days including an in absentia trial of Mikhail Romanov, a Russian soldier accused of rape and murder. He is accused of breaking into a house in March in a village in the Brovarsky region near Kyiv, murdering a man and then repeatedly raping his wife while “threatening her and her underage child with violence and weapons”. You can read more of Daniel Boffey’s report from Kyiv here: First Russian soldier goes on trial in Ukraine for war crimes Reuters is carrying another quote from Sweden about their moves to consider joining Nato. Defence minister Peter Hultqvist said: “If Sweden chooses to seek Nato membership, there is a risk of a reaction from Russia. Let me state that, in such a case, we are prepared to deal with any counter-response.” Yesterday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would “definitely” consider it a threat if Sweden’s neighbours Finland were to join Nato. Swedish membership of Nato would have a stabilising effect and would benefit countries around the Baltic sea, Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde said today, the day after neighbour Finland committed to applying to join the 30-nation alliance. “Swedish Nato membership would raise the threshold for military conflicts and thus have a conflict-preventing effect in northern Europe,” Linde told reporters when presenting a parliament report on security, Reuters reports. Sweden is widely expected to follow Finland’s lead and media reports have suggested Stockholm could apply for Nato membership as early as Monday. Ukrainian military forces released footage on Thursday that they say shows destroyed Russian military vehicles and a pontoon bridge in eastern Ukraine. According to the Ukrainian forces, the images were taken along the Siverskyi Donets River. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said on Friday the failed crossing of the river by Russian forces showed the pressure Russian commanders were under. The ministry’s intelligence update said the images suggested that Russia “lost armoured manoeuvre elements of at least one battalion tactical group” at the river, located west of Severodonetsk. While G7 foreign ministers have been meeting in Germany, Russia’s foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has been meeting his counterpart from Belarus. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has just posted a video clip of an interview conducted with Rai 1 in Italy. Overnight he posted to Telegram in English, saying: Russia’s strategic defeat is already obvious to everyone in the world and even to those who still continue to communicate with them. Russia simply lacks courage to admit it so far. They are cowards. And they are trying to hide the truth behind missile, air and artillery strikes. Therefore, our task is to fight until we achieve our goals in this war. Free our land, our people and reliably ensure our security. Russia’s defence ministry has claimed its forces struck the Kremenchug oil refinery in central Ukraine, destroying its production capacity and fuel tanks. Reuters reports the ministry also said its forces shot down a Ukrainian Su-27 aircraft in Kharkiv region. The reports have not been independently verified. Kharkiv governor Oleh Synyehubov has provided an update on the situation in his region on Telegram, saying “the night was relatively calm”. He said that a rocket had hit “the territory of Kharkiv airport”, but that no one was injured. He listed a small number of injuries and fatalities in Saltivka, Dergachi, Zolochiv, Balaklia and Shebelinka. He said that in Dergachi “the Russians damaged the humanitarian headquarters, the registry office, part of the clinic, and the ambulance building”, and that in Shebelinka “a Russian shell hit a hangar building. The roof of the hangar and 10 trucks were on fire. Unfortunately, three people died and 5 others were injured.” He added: In the Kharkiv direction, the occupiers did not attempt to attack. Fighting continues in the Izium region. Our armed forces hold positions and repel the enemy! None of the claims have been independently verified. A quick snap from Reuters here that the EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said this morning that the European Union would provide another €500m (£425m) worth of military support to Ukraine, and that he was confident a deal could be reached in the coming days to agree an embargo on Russian oil. Here are some of the latest images we have been sent over the newswires showing the impact of the conflict in Ukraine and beyond. British foreign secretary Liz Truss said it was vital to keep up the pressure on Russia by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and imposing further sanctions. “It is very important at this time that we keep up the pressure on Vladimir Putin by supplying more weapons to Ukraine and by increasing the sanctions,” Reuters reports she told the media on arrival at a G7 foreign ministers meeting in northern Germany. Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk, has issued a short update on Telegram this morning. He said that the Russians had “made every effort to break through the defences in Luhansk region” and attempted to storm “Rubizhne, Zolote, Nizhne, suburbs of Severodonetsk”. He suggested that the Russians were making another attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets, describing them as “racists” and “idiots”. He then said: [The Russians] do not manage to defeat the Ukrainians in battle, so the racists deliberately destroy the region, turning it into a desert. Most of our settlements are destroyed by 70%, those that are under occupation even more. The Russian embassy in Latvia has issued a strongly worded statement about the decision yesterday in Riga to suspend protections of Soviet monuments within its borders. The embassy says: We are outraged by the decision of the Latvian Saeima to unilaterally suspend Article 13 of the Russian-Latvian Intergovernmental Agreement of 30 April,1994, which prescribes the Latvian side to protect, maintain and take care of memorials. This traitorous, unjustified step has neither moral nor legal grounds and constitutes a flagrant violation of the universally recognised principles and norms of international law, including the provisions of this very treaty. This situation clearly demonstrates for the entire responsible international community the true face of the political elite of modern Latvia: cynicism, double standards, a complete rejection of civilised ways of settling interstate issues and brazen disregard for the fundamental principles of international law. In Latvia, the problem of settling the score with one’s own historical past is looming large. Yesterday Latvia’s parliament voted that protection of Soviet monuments would be suspended until Russian forces left Ukraine. MP Krista Baumane said the monuments were symbols of Russian occupation and of Russian crimes in Ukraine. A small number of lawmakers opposed the move, saying they were memorials for the victory over Nazism in the second world war, and nothing to do with the current conflict. The UK’s ministry of defence has said the failed crossing of the Siverskyi Donets river by Russian forces in the Donbas showed the pressure Russian commanders were under: Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky manoeuvre and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine. Russian forces have failed to make any significant advances despite concentrating forces in this area after withdrawing and redeploying units from the Kyiv and Chernihiv Oblasts. On Wednesday, Ukrainian forces successfully prevented the crossing, and released images which the MoD said indicated that Russia “lost significant armoured manoeuvre elements of at least one Battalion Tactical Group”. The pictures showed what Ukraine claimed were destroyed Russian tanks and other armoury in the village of Bilohorivka, near the strategic Ukrainian-held city of Lysychansk. The UK’s ministry of defence also said Russia was “investing significant effort in the vicinity of Izium and Severodonetsk in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough towards Sloviansk and Kramatorsk.” The primary objective on this axis is to envelop Ukrainian forces in the Joint Forces Operation area, isolating them from support or reinforcement by units in the west of the country. The Ukrainian counteroffensive around the north-eastern city of Kharkiv is “starting to look very similar to the counteroffensive that ultimately drove Russian troops away from Kyiv and out of western Ukraine entirely”, the Institute for the Study of War has said in its latest assessment of the conflict. It was “forcing the Russian command to make hard choices”, including by making Russian units focus their bombardments on attacking Ukrainian troops rather than the city, the US-based thinktank continued. Meanwhile, Russian forces may be abandoning their efforts to encircle Ukrainian troops along the Izyum-Slovyansk-Debaltseve line in eastern Ukraine in favour of shallower encirclements of the cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk. However, it was “unclear if Russian forces can encircle, let alone capture, Severodonetsk and Lysychansk even if they focus their efforts on that much-reduced objective”, the institute said. Russian offensives have bogged down every time they hit a built-up area throughout this war, and these areas are unlikely to be different. Continued and expanding reports of demoralisation and refusals to fight among Russian units suggest that the effective combat power of Russian troops in the east continues to be low and may drop further. If the Russians abandon efforts to advance from Izyum, moreover, Ukrainian forces would be able to concentrate their efforts on defending Severodonetsk-Lysychansk or, in the worst case, breaking a Russian encirclement before those settlements fall. However, the thinktank also noted Russian forces probably control almost all of the city of Rubizhne as of 12 May and have most likely seized the town of Voevodivka, north of Severodonetsk. They will likely launch a ground offensive on or around Severodonetsk in the coming days. The relative success of Russian operations in this area combined with their failure to advance from Izyum and the notable decline in the energy of that attempted advance suggest that they may be giving up on the Izyum axis. The report also noted that Russian forces were strengthening their position on Snake Island, in the Black Sea, in a bid to block Ukrainian maritime communications near they key port city of Odesa. Ukraine says it has damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island, a small but strategic outpost in the Black Sea, Reuters reports. “Thanks to the actions of our naval seamen, the support vessel Vsevolod Bobrov caught fire – it is one of the newest in the Russian fleet,” said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration. Reuters could not independently verify the details. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Images also showed recent damage to buildings on the island, which became famous for the foul-mouthed defiance of its Ukrainian defenders early in the invasion. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast, according to some defence officials, as Russian forces struggle to make headway in Ukraine’s north and east. A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since the invasion began when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday, the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey reports. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv’s district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Read on here: International sanctions on Russia should remain in place until all its troops have left Ukraine, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has told a meeting of her G7 counterparts in Germany according to the BBC. “Putin is humiliating himself on the world stage. We must ensure he faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit and ultimately constrains further aggression,” she said. She also said that Ukraine’s allies should commit to more sanctions against Russia and that they should go “further and faster” to support it in its war. “The best long-term security for Ukraine will come from it being able to defend itself. That means providing Ukraine with a clear pathway to Nato-standard equipment,” she said. Truss has been accused of taking a risky approach to the war, one that could risk inflaming the situation further and endangering any peace talks or chances of de-escalation. Hello, this is Helen Livingstone bringing you the latest developments on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here’s a roundup of the latest: A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial of the invasion. Vadim Shysimarin,21, a commander in Russia’s Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting dead an unarmed man,62, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone in the village of Chupakhivka, Sumy. Shysimarin was ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. International sanctions on Russia should only be lifted when all its troops have left Ukraine, UK foreign secretary Liz Truss has told a meeting of her G7 counterparts according to the BBC. “We must ensure he [Putin] faces a defeat in Ukraine that denies him any benefit,” she said. The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession, after Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said it must apply to join the military alliance “without delay”. Sweden is expected to follow within days. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland on Friday, a day after Finnish leaders said they would apply to join Nato, according to reports. The Republican senator Rand Paul has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill for Ukraine in the US Senate. Paul demanded changes including an inspector general to oversee how it is spent. Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that “at least several thousand Ukrainians” have been sent to so-called “filtration centres” in Russia where they are subject to “brutal interrogations”. Tens of thousands more had been evacuated to Russia or Russia-controlled territory. Carpenter said that one survivor said “everyone was afraid to be taken to Donetsk”, where they could be the victim of “further investigation or murder”. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romania and the Baltic, are being discussed at a three-day meeting of G7 foreign and agriculture ministers in Germany. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine – enough to feed 400 million people – was exported through its seven Black Sea ports. Ukraine claimed it had damaged and set on fire a Russian navy logistics ship in the Black Sea. The Vsevolod Bobrov was near Snake Island, said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine. The Guardian could not independently verify the details and Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” were ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We work step by step,’” he said. “We will exchange 38, then we will move on.” The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia’s invasion has exceeded six million, the UN’s refugee agency has said. A further eight million people have been displaced inside Ukraine. The UN’s human rights council has passed a resolution to investigate alleged abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control, with a view to holding those responsible to account. The resolution passed by a strong majority," with 33 members voting in favour and two – China and Eritrea – against. There were 12 abstentions.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zelenskiy visits Ukrainian troops on frontline as Russia pushes them back,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/you-all-deserve-victory-zelenskiy-visits-ukraine-troops-on-eastern-frontline,2022-06-06T08:38:30Z,President makes rare publicised visit outside Kyiv to Lysychansk,"The Ukrainian president has visited the frontline close to the fiercest fighting between his country’s troops and Russian forces in the east, where a regional official said the situation had worsened for Ukraine. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited the beleaguered city of Lysychansk on Sunday, just a few kilometres south from Sievierodonetsk, the main battlefield in the east where Russia has concentrated its forces. Ukrainian troops had a slight reversal of fortunes after managing to retake half of Sievierodonetsk, Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk province where the city is located, told national television. Haidai did not go into details but said Ukrainian troops were still holding their positions in the city’s industrial zone. “The fiercest fighting is in Sievierodonetsk. Fast-moving fighting is happening right now,” he said. The fight to push Russian forces back received a boost on Sunday when the UK government said it would supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. Zelenskiy also visited the Donbas city of Soledar in a rare outing by the Ukrainian president outside the capital Kyiv since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February that could be his closest yet to the frontline. “I went with the head of [my] office to the east. We were in Lysychansk and Soledar,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, adding he would not elaborate on the visit. In two videos released later, Zelenskiy was shown talking to troops in confined, bunker-like structures, presenting some with awards and addressing others. “What you all deserve is victory – that is the most important thing. But not at any cost,” Zelenskiy said in one of the videos. Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk are in the Luhansk region and Soledar is in the Donetsk region. Both regions make up the broader Donbas region, Ukraine’s industrial heartland, which Russia claims is on a mission to “liberate”. Earlier on Sunday, Zelenskiy said he had also visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, whose governor claims that 60% of the area is under Russian occupation. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles (80km) away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Spain is also increasing its support for Ukraine, according to government sources cited by El País newspaper. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle vehicles along with training for the equipment. Spain had previously sent only ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons to Ukraine. The additional military support for Ukraine came after Nato began almost two weeks of naval exercises led by the US in the Baltic Sea on Sunday. More than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 countries will take part, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden, in the annual Baltops (Baltic operations) exercise that has been running since 1972. Nato said with Sweden and Finland participating, it was “seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength”. Finland and Sweden have a long history of military non-alignment before their governments applied to join Nato in May, a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Over the past years, Moscow has repeatedly warned Helsinki and Stockholm against joining the western military alliance and warned of retaliatory measures if they did. “It is important for us, the United States and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” the US general Mark Milley, the chair of the joint chiefs of staff, said on Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm. Milley, speaking to the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, stressed that the Baltic was a strategically important body of water and “one of the great seaways of the world”. He said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato would be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St Petersburg and its surrounding areas. As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. This year’s Baltops exercise is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on 17 June.

Kremlin mulls Nuremberg-style trials based on second world war tribunals,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/kremlin-mulls-nuremberg-style-trials-based-on-second-world-war-tribunals,2022-05-28T04:30:21Z,"Russia to seek to justify invasion of Ukraine by staging show trials of war prisoners, conflict scholars fear","The gloating began just days after the missiles began falling on Ukraine. “Get ready for Nuremberg 2.0,” one former Russian diplomat wrote in a WhatsApp message. Vladimir Putin’s invasion to “denazify” the country has always pointed toward a purge and show trials. Now Moscow may seize on that chance. As Russia holds hundreds of prisoners from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, its proxies in east Ukraine have floated the idea of holding a “military tribunal” inspired by Nuremberg that observers say would reflect a mass show trial meant to justify Russia’s invasion to the world. “We are planning to organise an international tribunal on the republic’s territory,” said Denis Pushilin, the leader of a Russian-controlled territory in the Donetsk region. A model could be the Kharkiv trial of 1943, he said, when the Soviet military tried, convicted and executed three Germans and one Ukrainian by hanging. One key audience was the world press. Photos of the hangings were printed in Life magazine. Whether the Kremlin will follow through with such a gruesome spectacle remains unclear, but the idea has found backers in the foreign ministry and among top MPs who have angrily declared that there should be no prisoner exchanges of the soldiers captured in Mariupol. The head of annexed Crimea said that a tribunal in Russian-occupied east Ukraine, where local authorities support the death penalty, would serve as a “lesson for everyone who forgot the lessons of Nuremberg”. The signalling of a great political trial has raised fears that Russia is about to pass yet another grisly landmark in its reliving of the second world war, simulating a triumphant legal process that would taint the legacy of the Nuremberg verdict. One expert called it an Orwellian distortion of the postwar language of human rights. It would be “a political trial whose aim is to present a particular narrative about the war that supports the argument about denazification that Putin has been putting forward, that supports his claim that Ukraine is being run by Nazis and that supports his claims that there are direct links between the Ukrainian collaborators during the second world war and Ukrainian soldiers today”, said Francine Hirsch, a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and the author of Soviet Judgment at Nuremberg: A New History of the International Military Tribunal after World War II. “I think it’s going to be used to try to present what we in the west understand as a fiction as if it’s a reality. That’s what show trials do.” With a growing focus on Russian war crimes in Ukraine, including an international investigation into the massacre of civilians in towns such as Bucha, some observers believe that Moscow may launch a military tribunal as a counter-process as more atrocities are revealed. “They’re trying to create a counterbalance because of all the talk of the international criminal court and the Ukrainian prosecutions” for war crimes said Philippe Sands, a professor of law at University College London and author of East West Street: On the Origins of Genocide and Crimes against Humanity. “I suspect … they’re creating another form of leverage for what’s going to come in due course.” Sands has been part of an effort now under discussion to form a special criminal tribunal to try Russia for the crime of aggression, a charge that was originally coined at the Nuremberg trials of 1945-46 by a Soviet lawyer as “crimes against peace”. He said there was an irony to Russia’s embrace of a Nuremberg-style process that would ignore any charges for launching an illegal war against Ukraine. “For me, the crime of aggression is the beating heart of this whole issue,” said Sands. “At the end of the day, if Putin had not gone to war, none of the other crimes would have taken place.” As part of the history of the second world war, the Nuremberg trials remain a deeply personal issue for the Kremlin. The decision to propose a military tribunal is a dive deeper into what one former adviser called a historical “mania”, where terms like “denazification” are seen as having the potential to mobilise the Russian public. The Kremlin “thinks this is what the public wants to see … to feel themselves a part of history”, said the former adviser, who has worked with Putin. He also said he believed that senior officials had bought into their own propaganda about the resurgence of nazism in the west. History appears to be the wellspring for both the Kremlin’s propaganda and state policy. Nikolai Patrushev, the head of Russia’s security council and a top Putin ally, said in an interview this week that its policies for the “denazification” of Ukraine were exactly the same as in Nazi Germany in 1945. “It’s fanaticism,” the adviser said. The Nuremberg trials that convicted Nazi war criminals reflected the political divisions of the times. Western representatives were concerned that the Soviets treated them as a repeat of their own show trials of the 1930s. The Soviet judges were appalled when Winston Churchill gave his famous “iron curtain” speech about the menace of communism while the trial was in progress. Today, Russia has wielded the trial as a shield against accusations of the crimes under Stalin. After the European parliament condemned Russian state propaganda in 2019 for “whitewashing communist crimes and glorifying the Soviet totalitarian regime”, Putin shot back that the statement “challenged the conclusions of the Nuremberg trials” and could “undermine the foundations of the entire postwar Europe”. “There’s a narrative about Nuremberg that has become really significant. It’s a narrative where the Soviets are the heroes and the Soviets are the victims but they weren’t responsible for any kinds of crimes,” said Hirsch. “There’s a way in which Nuremberg has really become a part of Russia’s patriotic education.” Now there are new concerns that Russia could use a tribunal modelled on a glorious past to whitewash its new invasion of Ukraine. “If these kinds of things happen we need to be ready for it and journalists need to really think about how do you cover this,” said Hirsch. “How do you cover something that you know is play-acting but is deadly?”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kremlin threatens retaliation after Finland leaders say it must join Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/finland-apply-join-nato-without-delay-president-pm,2022-05-12T14:12:35Z,Finland’s president and PM make call as support for joining trebles since Ukraine war,"Finland must apply to join Nato “without delay” in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, signalling a historic shift in the country’s security policy that drew a blunt warning of retaliation from the Kremlin. With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, Sauli Niinistö, Finland’s president, and Sanna Marin, the prime minister, made the call in a joint statement, adding: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security, the two leaders said, and as a member of Nato, “Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency”. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat, and the foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession. “The expansion of Nato and the approach of the alliance to our borders does not make the world and our continent more stable and secure,” Peskov said. “Everything will depend on how this process takes place, how far the military infrastructure moves towards our borders.” Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow would be “forced to take reciprocal steps … to address the resulting threats to its national security”. It accused Nato of seeking to create “another flank for the military threat to our country” and said Helsinki should “be aware of its responsibility and the consequences of such a move”. The Finnish daily Iltalehti reported that key Finnish politicians had been told Russia could halt gas supplies to Finland on Friday, although it did not say where the warning came from or whether it was in response to the Nato announcement. Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia and has for decades maintained a strict policy of military non-alignment, viewing membership of the US-led alliance as an unnecessary provocation of Moscow. However, Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February has led to a profound change in its thinking, and looks likely to usher in the very expansion of the western military alliance that the Russian president aimed to prevent. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland, with the latest poll by the public broadcaster Yle showing 76% of Finns in favour compared with about 25% before the invasion, with only 12% against. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting Finland’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats are scheduled to decide on Sunday whether to overturn their longstanding opposition to Nato membership, paving the way for a probable application from Stockholm also to join the 30-nation alliance. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, said Niinistö and Marin’s statement was “an important message”, adding that Finland was “Sweden’s closest security and defence partner” and its assessments “must be taken into account”. Sweden’s Expressen daily, citing unnamed sources, said Stockholm’s final decision would be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted soon afterwards. Nordic media have previously said the two countries were likely to submit a joint application. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Finland would be “warmly welcomed” into the alliance and promised the accession process would be “smooth and swift”, although ratification by all 30 members could take several months. Finland is one of Nato’s “closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security”, Stoltenberg said, adding that Finnish membership would prove that the alliance’s “door is open”. Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic Sea region, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president, said on Thursday that western countries’ “proxy war with Russia” would “increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia”. Urging the west not to “lie to yourself and others” and “choke in the paroxysms of Russophobia”, Medvedev said such a conflict “always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war” and that this would be “catastrophic for everyone”. Other governments in the region, however, welcomed Helsinki’s statement. Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Finnish membership would “strengthen Nato and our common security”. Copenhagen would do everything for a quick admission process, she said. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, tweeted his support, saying he had assured Niinistö of “the full support of the federal government” in a phone call. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said her country supported Finland’s rapid accession. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Finland’s decision was “great news for Poland and Europe’s security”, and the prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said his country would “of course” support a Finnish application to join the alliance. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, told the European parliament accession to Nato would strengthen security in the region. Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states were already Nato members and the addition of Finland would “bring added value”, he said. Finland and Sweden are officially non-aligned but became Nato partners – taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence – after abandoning their strict neutrality when they joined the EU in 1995 after the end of the cold war. Finland declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of Russian rule, and its heavily outnumbered army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding some border territory. Sweden has not fought a war for 200 years. Marin and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said at a joint press conference last month that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had changed Europe’s whole security landscape and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic countries. Nato’s common security guarantee rests on article 5, the alliance’s cornerstone, which says an attack on one Nato member is an attack on all. It has been invoked only once in the organisation’s history, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK beer costs soar as average price of pint tops £8 in one London pub,https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/jun/04/uk-beer-costs-soar-average-price-pint-tops-8-pounds-one-london-pub,2022-06-04T10:38:47Z,"Price hikes driven by combination of factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine","The price of a pint in London has long been bemoaned as the sign of how expensive it is to live in the capital. However, as crowds flocked to central London to toast the Queen on the jubilee bank holiday weekend, some would have been staggered if they ordered a round of drinks in one pub, after it emerged the the average price of a pint has topped £8 for the first time. The average price of a pint has risen by more than 70% since the financial crisis nearly 15 years ago, from £2.30 in 2008 to £3.95, according to research by the consultancy CGA . In one pub in London, which CGA did not name, the average price of a pint was £8.06 – the most expensive it has ever recorded, in its survey of more than 5,550 random bars and pubs. The cheapest was in Lancashire and cost £1.79. If prices had solely followed inflation between January 2008 and April 2022, the cost of a pint would have been £3.35, the Financial Times reported. Since 2020, CGA’s figures show that the cost of an average pint has risen by more than 7%. Further increases are expected. The price hikes have been driven by a combination of factors, including inflation and the war in Ukraine. The country was the world’s fourth largest producer of barley, a key ingredient in beer. Analysts Bernstein warned that costs of malting barley could reach 70%. In the UK, inflation recently reached 9%, with the governor of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey warning that it will hit a four-decade high later this year. These issues add to existing problems for pubs after a turbulent period during the Covid-19 pandemic. Since reopening in 2021, they have had higher food and drink supply prices, exacerbated by delays to cross-channel deliveries since Brexit, and a shortage of staff as customers returned. This led landlords to offer higher wages to attract and retain workers, but further ate into their profit margins. Suffolk brewer and pub company Adnams warned in March that barley prices meant they were likely to increase prices for customers. Wolverhampton-based Marstons increased prices by 8% in March, and customers in Greene King pubs are now paying 5% more on average per pint. Clive Watson, the chair of City Pub Group, which operates 41 pubs in London and the south, told the FT that ingredient costs were up 10%, “wage inflation is probably 7% and electricity inflation is 100%, so that blended cost price probably puts the price of a pint of beer up 12% to 13%”. CPG raised its prices by 5-6% in December, but said it would hold back on further increases to encourage people to go to the pub. A trend followed by others after 18 months of stop-start closures during the Covid pandemic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘I didn’t believe stories of atrocities in Ukraine. But then I saw the photos’,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/may/06/ukraine-photos-poland-border-refugees-rape-atrocities,2022-05-06T06:30:08Z,"Based over the border in Poland, one rights activist tells of her shock at hearing accounts of rape and murder in Ukraine","When women at the border started talking to me about rapes and murders happening inside Ukraine, I thought these were just rumours; I wouldn’t let myself believe it. I told myself that it was just people sharing scare stories or that women were just trying to rationalise their feelings of guilt about leaving their husbands and sons. Maybe my psyche was trying to defend itself. Then a woman in her 70s, who said she was from one of the occupied areas close to Irpin and Bucha, crossed the border with her daughter and great-granddaughter. They were being treated by medical volunteers at the French mission. The daughter, who was in her 50s, had cancer and was very sick. The medics could not believe that someone like this, with a hole in her stomach and no bandages, was so desperate to leave that she would risk travelling for so many hours with no medical support. The woman told me that her grandson served in a military brigade that had been the first to go into recently liberated areas. She said he took photos of what he had seen. She showed them to me, and it was only then I understood it was worse than I could have ever imagined. She said that after her grandson had returned from duty, he had come to her house and begged her to leave Ukraine. He told her that women were being raped and killed by Russian troops but she refused to leave. In desperation, he showed her the photos and she knew she had to flee. One of the photos she showed me was the hanging body of a young girl. She couldn’t have been more than 14. She said her grandson told her he was walking through the woods looking for dead bodies left by the Russians and lifted his head and saw these girls strung from the trees, all of them very young. They were naked and torn up. She said he had passed on the photos to investigators in Ukraine who were gathering evidence of war crimes. I was not ready to see something like this. In Ukraine now there are many photos of what happened in Bucha but in Poland these are not widely circulated. Since she showed it to me I think my brain has tried to blank it out because I can’t even recreate it in my mind. All I remember is a white blur in the top-left corner of a shattered phone screen. She told me that after she had seen these photos she went to the hospital where her daughter was being treated in the oncology ward. She went in, took out her daughter’s intravenous drip and helped her walk to the car and they just took off. When I met them on the border, the car they were driving was shattered. The lights were broken, they had foil instead of windows. They had driven all that way in a car where the wheels were still turning but that was about it. But this lady said that after she started driving she didn’t stop until she had left Ukraine. Often when women first cross the border they’re elated, happy to reach safety. They start smiling, joking – you’d never guess they’ve had any sort of trauma. Since I have seen that photo, I keep thinking back to those other women I have met and wondering what they might have gone through. There have been women who have been asking me about getting hold of pills that cause menstruation. At the time I didn’t understand what they meant. There was another woman who came over with a 17-year-old daughter. The daughter would not stop crying. I asked her how I could help, and what was going on. She asked for thick menstrual pads, underwear and trousers for the girl. I remember her as she had the same name as my own daughter. That woman also told me that when she went through the last checkpoints outside Kharkiv, she kept driving without stopping. It isn’t just the ones who talk about the violence they have faced or witnessed. You worry about all the women who make the crossing. There are many who just cannot deal with being this helpless. There was one woman, you could tell that she was wealthy. Her clothes were very nice, her shoes were very nice. The children were dressed nicely. And from their manners you could tell they were well-off. And their older girl, about 10, sat at the table in the reception centre and said: “Well, here you have free soup.” And the little boy said: “I don’t want a free soup.” The mother sat not saying anything until she just exploded and yelled: “You’re refugees now, and you need to eat everything they give you.” This was the change they experienced – that when they crossed the border, everything they had had before had stayed behind in Ukraine. Then they leave you and you never find out what happened to them next.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia says 900 Ukrainian troops sent to prison colony from Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/ukraine-mariupol-azovstal-soldiers-russia,2022-05-18T17:02:01Z,Fate of soldiers leaving Azovstal site unclear and numbers not confirmed by Ukraine,"More than 900 Ukrainian troops who were at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant have been sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory, Moscow has said, as their fate remains uncertain. A foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said on Wednesday evening that of the 959 Ukrainian service personnel Russia said had surrendered since Tuesday, 51 were being treated for their injuries and the remainder had been sent to a former prison colony in the town of Olenivka in a Russian-controlled area of Donetsk region. Russia’s defence ministry also released videos on Wednesday of what it said were Ukrainian fighters receiving hospital treatment in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk after surrendering at the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol. In the videos, a group of men were shown lying on beds in a room, and two spoke briefly to the camera. In one, a soldier said he was being treated “normally”, adding that he was not being psychology pressured. It was not possible to establish if the soldier was speaking freely. Zakharova told journalists all the wounded Azovstal soldiers “will be provided with qualified medical care”. Ukraine has not commented on Russia’s latest update. In his address to the nation late on Tuesday, the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said an “evacuation mission” was continuing with help from “the most influential international mediators”. It is also not clear how many remain inside the plant. Denis Pushilin, the head of the self-proclaimed republic of Donetsk, said on Wednesday that the “commanders of the highest level” were still hiding in the plant. Earlier, Ukrainian officials had said some of its soldiers remained. The two sides in the war have released practically no details of the agreement that led to the surrender of the troops, who were holed up for weeks in an extensive network of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said on Tuesday the soldiers would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but a number of Russian officials on Wednesday repeated statements made a day earlier by other hardliners that the soldiers should be tried. Pushilin on Wednesday called on an “international tribunal” to be set to decide the soldiers’ “fate”. “As for war criminals as well as those who are nationalists, their fate, if they laid down their arms, should be decided by the courts,” he said. “If the enemy has laid down arms, then his fate will be decided by the courts. If it is a Nazi criminal, then it’s a tribunal.” The Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, whose forces have participated in the battle for Mariupol, said the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, should not be exchanged and “must be punished by law”. Speaking at an educational forum in Moscow, Kadyrov said Russian forces were facing some “difficulties” in Ukraine as a result of Nato arms deliveries to the country. It was the second statement by a Russian official on Wednesday that acknowledged some of the Russian military failings in Ukraine after Rashid Nurgaliyev, the deputy secretary of the Russian security council, said that “despite all the current difficulties, the special operation will be completed”. The Azov regiment was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The Russian Duma is expected to discuss the subject this week and potentially accept a new resolution that would ban prisoner exchanges of Azov fighters. Next week, Russia’s supreme court will also hear an application to designate Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, opening the way for sentences of up to 20 years for those convicted of involvement. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which exists to examine major crimes, has already announced plans to interrogate the surrendered soldiers, without indicating whether they would be treated as suspects. The fate of the forces taken prisoner at Azovstal could further complicate efforts to resume peace negotiations, with both sides blaming each other for a breakdown in talks. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, accused Ukraine of a “total lack of desire” to continue the negotiations, while the Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said talks were on hold . The Azov movement has been used as a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative to justify the war in Ukraine, and Andrei Kolesnikov of the Carnegie Moscow Center said Russian politicians were using their surrender “to promote themselves and show their loyalty to the Kremlin”. “But ultimately, their statements don’t matter much and it will be Putin who decides what happens to the Ukrainian soldiers,” Kolesnikov added. He said what Putin chose to do with the Azovstal soldiers could point to his current intentions in the conflict. “If he decides to try the soldiers, it will be a clear, worrying sign that he is willing to further escalate the situation. It will be a spit in Zelenskiy’s face.” Alternatively, Kolesnikov said, trading soldiers with Ukraine would be framed domestically as a Russian “act of mercy and compassion” despite the current calls by Putin’s hardliners demanding severe punishment for the soldiers. “At home, Putin has flexibility and could play both cards,” Kolesnikov said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian prosecutions of Azov fighters could breach Geneva conventions,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/russian-prosecutions-azov-fighters-geneva-conventions-ukraine,2022-05-18T11:40:51Z,Analysis: prisoners of war are protected under treaties unless accused of war crimes,"Any Russian moves to prosecute and potentially execute some of the hundreds of Ukrainian fighters who surrendered in Mariupol could be in breach of the Geneva conventions, which state that prisoners of war should not be punished for having taken part in hostilities. The concerns were underlined by the UK’s armed forces minister, James Heappey,who told the radio station LBC: “I think there have been enough atrocities in this war already without seeing the execution or whatever of the prisoners of war, which I fear this is a prelude to. I just think we have to be very clear, that sort of atrocity the west would stand in utter condemnation of. Prisoners of war have a status enshrined in the Geneva convention.” Among those who have called for the prosecution of the fighters who have been leaving the sprawling Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is the pro-Russia Donetsk separatist leader Denis Pushilin, who said on Wednesday that a court would decide their fate. The Geneva conventions comprise four treaties and three protocols establishing international legal standards for humanitarian treatment during wars. The single term Geneva convention usually refers to the agreements negotiated in 1949 after the second world war. The 1949 convention says PoWs must not be prosecuted for their direct part in hostilities, and makes clear that detention after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but a means to prevent further participation in the conflict. The only permissible exception is that the detaining power may prosecute prisoners for possible war crimes. One of Russia’s claimed justifications for its war of aggression against Ukraine was that members of the Azov regiment in Mariupol were responsible for war crimes. Early on in the battle for the port city, the Russian defence spokesperson Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov claimed: “It was these Azov battalion Nazis who had been exterminating civilian population in Donetsk and Luhansk republics, deliberately and with exceptional cruelty, for eight years.” Concern over the potential fate of some of the Ukrainian soldiers has been raised after threats by Russian officials to treat them as “terrorists” rather than combatants. Although Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised that the fighters who surrendered would be treated “in accordance with international standards”, this was immediately undermined by statements from other Russian officials. “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, the chair of the State Duma, in a speech on Tuesday, referring to Ukrainian offers of a prisoner exchange. “Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.” Russia’s justice ministry appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine, and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. Both sides in the conflict have been accused of breaches of the Geneva conventions in their treatment of prisoners. Matilda Bogner, the head of the United Nations human rights monitoring mission in Ukraine, said there was “credible information” of mistreatment of prisoners. “We have received credible information of torture, ill-treatment and incommunicado detention by Ukrainian armed forces of prisoners of war belonging to the Russian armed forces and affiliated armed groups,” Bogner said.

We might need to get used to it | Will Hutton,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/22/food-crisis-is-what-happens-when-global-chains-collapse-we-might-need-to-get-used-to-it,2022-05-22T08:00:43Z,War in Ukraine is the latest threat to the whole intellectual edifice of globalisation,"All my life, the widely shared assumption has been that there will always be food to buy – albeit at a price. No more. Suddenly, Russia’s successful blockade of Ukraine, choking off its crucially important exports of grain and oilseeds, has challenged all that. The west is right to hail Ukraine’s remarkable achievements on the battlefield – but Russia holds cards in this war that may yet prove to its decisive advantage. When the UN secretary-general warns of the spectre of a world food shortage, take notice. Equally, the governor of the Bank of England has been much derided for warning of a food apocalypse: he may choose his words clumsily, but he is right. What is provoking these warnings is that there is no way to replace Ukrainian grain exports, which constitute 9% of the world’s, made worse by the decline in Russia’s grain exports. Only a fraction of Ukraine’s cereal harvests can find their way into global markets via road or through ports in Romania – and Russia has no intention of lifting its blockade while it faces sanctions that may last years, given the stalemate in Ukraine. The price of grain is thus certain to rise – it is already 59% higher than in January – reflecting that there is less to go around. Those who can’t pay will simply go without, raising the prospect of famine spreading to hundreds of millions in poorer countries and a new flood of refugees. Nor will Britain be unaffected, although it is largely self-sufficient in grain. Overall, we rely on imports to meet around half our food demands. All over the world, countries facing shortages of grain and other foodstuffs are simply halting their food exports; already, 22 countries have prohibited 10% of all food trade. Our four major food suppliers are our EU neighbours and former partners, now all too often turned into enemies: France, Ireland, the Netherlands and Germany. Yet, just at this moment the Johnson government, with its habitual reckless incompetence and obsessive hatred of all things EU related, is prepared to risk an EU trade war by unilaterally abrogating the Brexit treaty. The UK may not want to damage crucial EU food imports, already deferring any regulatory checks until the end of next year. But why should EU member states play ball with a country whose leader they regard as a deceitful clown in hock to the worst of his party’s right, who never loses the chance to criticise the common agricultural policy (CAP), built to ensure European food security? Suddenly the CAP looks like a strategic asset, with the EU recently moving to strengthen its farmers’ productive capacity and self-sufficiency in ways wholly at odds with Britain’s disdainful neglect of its own farmers. The EU may decide in response to Britain’s provocation that EU food security is of paramount importance, directing food exports only to where there is more need than Britain – for example, increasing its already hefty food support to Ukraine – or just making haulage and shipping regulatory requirements even tougher. They can do so, secure that EU producers can sell their food elsewhere, so creating food shortages in Britain. If the EU does not wish to go so far, it has other effective levers to make Boris Johnson back down. Russia is the world’s biggest exporter of fertilisers, whose price has now soared 300% following the west’s trade sanctions. The UK produces only two-fifths of the fertiliser our farmers need, the balance imported mainly from the EU, Germany in particular. Fertiliser and chemical production is an area where Brexit UK sees “opportunity” in diverging from EU single market rules that assure high product and safety standards, and is a key import into Northern Ireland. The EU has only to suspend or curtail EU fertiliser exports to Britain, concerned about our desire to weaken those rules, to crucify British agricultural production, which is already reeling from sky-high feed and fuel costs. We are so badly governed by ministers and a party living in a sealed right-wing bubble that food rationing in 2023 is a real risk. More Brexit voters might think they were lied to. The larger point is that confidence over the past 30 years that globalisation was here to stay has led to the world’s food production and distribution system becoming profoundly interdependent, concentrated in a few countries and a few powerful agribusiness companies. As my colleague George Monbiot argues in his powerful book Regenesis, the system has become ever more market-based and less resilient, with some countries, notably Britain, assuming that there was no need for wasteful things like storage facilities, food reserves or ensuring strong domestic environmentally sustainable production. Food, animal feed and fertilisers would flow seamlessly through safe international supply chains: domestic farmers’ margins could be squeezed to the bone. “Global” Britain could take this one step further, throwing off the crippling “shackles” of the CAP and buying cheap food from wherever, careless of UK farmers, quality food and the environment – hence the absurd trade deal dramatically favouring Australian farm producers over British ones, one of foreign secretary Liz Truss’s proudest achievements to please the Brexit right. Today the whole intellectual edifice looks profoundly stupid – even dangerous. Resilience and sustainability in food production and distribution, along with ensuring everyone can afford to eat a healthy diet, constitute a foundational building block in our civilisation – even if mocked by Tory backbenchers and undermined by Brexiters. Last week’s rise in inflation to 9% was driven by uncapped energy bills and escalating food prices. Britain’s inflation rate – the highest in the G7 – is because we have the least resilient, most market-based system for delivering key goods and services, and we are not a member of one of the big blocs partly able to protect itself from worldwide trends. We are a cork being thrown helplessly around the global ocean. The curtain is finally coming down on the great Thatcherite experiment. The tragic pity is that so many millions are going to find out the hardest way – through eating crap food or, worse, going hungry – just how wrong-headed their leaders have been. • Will Hutton is an Observer columnist",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia-Ukraine war latest: G7 commits to phasing out Russian oil, says Putin’s actions ‘bring shame on Russia’– as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/08/russia-ukraine-war-evacuation-of-women-and-children-from-mariupol-steelworks-complete-kyiv-claims-sinking-of-second-russian-ship-live,2022-05-09T02:57:32Z,Odesa hit by missiles but Ukraine launches counter-offensive in north; US first lady meets Olena Zelenskiy at a school,"Japan will take time to phase out Russian oil imports after agreeing on a ban with other G7 nations to counter Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, prime minister Fumio Kishida has said. “For a country heavily dependent on energy imports, it’s a very difficult decision. But G7 coordination is most important at a time like now,” Kishida told reporters according to Reuters, repeating comments he made at the G7 meeting. As for the timing of the reduction or stoppage of (Russian) oil imports, we will consider it while gauging the actual situation. We will take our time to take steps towards a phase-out. He did not elaborate. The G7 nations committed to the move “in a timely and orderly fashion” at an online meeting on Sunday to put further pressure on president Vladimir Putin, although members such as resource-poor Japan depend heavily on Russian fuel. There have been no ships loading Russian oil for Japan since mid-April, according to Refinitiv data. About 1.9 million barrels were exported from Russia to Japan in April, 33% down from the same month a year ago. The Ukraine crisis has highlighted Japan’s energy dependence on Russia even as Tokyo has acted swiftly and in tandem with the G7 in instituting sanctions. The latest ban underlines a turn in Japan’s policy. Japan has said it would be difficult to immediately cut off Russian oil imports, which accounted for about 33 million barrels of Japan’s overall oil imports, or 4%, for 2021. It has already said it will ban Russian coal imports in stages, leaving just liquefied natural gas (LNG). Japan is in a particularly tough spot since it shut down the bulk of its nuclear reactors following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster. Russia was Japan’s fifth-biggest supplier of crude oil and LNG last year. A Fiji court has suspended the execution of a US warrant to seize a $300 million super yacht Washington claims is owned by sanctioned Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov, prosecutors have said according to AFP. The 348-foot Amadea has been targeted because Kerimov is among a group of oligarchs close to Moscow who have been sanctioned by the United States over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The yacht remains in Fiji police custody and is blocked from leaving the Pacific nation’s waters despite the warrant suspension, prosecutors said. The luxurious Amadea – which has a helipad, pool, jacuzzi and “winter garden” on its sun deck, according to tracking website superyachtfan.com – has been berthed in Lautoka, Fiji in the South Pacific since mid-April. Last week, Fijian law enforcement, backed by US agents, took control of the super yacht under the warrant, which was lodged with the island state’s High Court. The US Justice Department requested the vessel, which it has estimated to be valued at $300 million, be seized for violating sanctions and for alleged ties to corruption. But the company officially registered as the Amadea’s owner, Millemarin Investment, on Friday obtained a temporary stay on the US warrant’s execution from the Court of Appeal, Fiji prosecutors said. The Court of Appeal “granted an interim stay on the execution of the warrant”, a spokeswoman for Fiji’s office of the director of public prosecutions told AFP on Monday. The case is scheduled to return to court on Thursday and the US warrant remains officially registered with the Fiji courts, she said. “The yacht has been further restrained from leaving the Fiji waters until further notice,” she added. “It is in Fiji police custody at this point.” The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine, Guardian business reporter Joanna Partridge writes. The third wave of sanctions was announced by the Department for International Trade just hours ahead of Russia’s 9 May Victory Day celebrations. The latest £1.7bn sanctions on Russia and neighbouring Belarus – which has joined in the invasion of Ukraine and been used as a base for Russian soldiers – are aimed at knocking Putin’s ability to fund his war. The new package of restrictions includes £1.4bn of UK import tariffs – border taxes paid by buyers on goods shipped from Russia – that will affect imports of platinum, palladium and other products including chemicals from Russia. The international trade department said Russia was highly dependent on the UK for exports of the precious metals, which will be subject to additional 35 percentage point tariffs. The latest measures, announced by the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, bring the total value of products subject to full or partial trade sanctions since Russia’s invasion to more than £4bn. For more, read on here: Here’s a bit more from Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who gave an interview to Reuters during his unannounced visit to Ukraine on Sunday, telling the newswire the world would do everything possible to ensure that Russian president Vladimir Putin loses his war in Ukraine, including keeping Moscow under sanctions for years. “What Putin needs to understand is that the west is absolutely determined and resolved to stand against what he is doing,” Trudeau said. His illegal war, his escalations, his crossing of red lines by choosing to further invade Ukraine means that we will do as a world everything we can to make sure that he loses. Speaking on the sidelines of an unannounced visit to Ukraine for talks with president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whom he calls a friend, Trudeau said Putin was making a terrible mistake. “He is inflicting atrocities upon civilians, and it’s all something that he is doing because he thought he could win. But he can only lose,” Trudeau said when asked what he would tell Putin on the eve of Russia’s commemorations of the defeat of Nazi Germany in World War Two, which Moscow calls the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. Trudeau also echoed a statement from the Group of Seven issued earlier on Sunday, following a video call of G7 leaders with Zelinskiy, on how Putin’s “actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people” during the second world war. Quite frankly, on Victory in Europe Day, when we all celebrate the victory over fascism of so many decades ago. Vladimir Putin is bringing shame upon the memory of the millions of Russians who fought and died in the fight for freedom and the fight against fascism. Earlier, Trudeau said Canada would provide new weapons and equipment for Ukraine and will reopen its embassy in Kyiv, the country’s capital. Trudeau said all the countries that have imposed sanctions on Moscow, which have taken a steep toll on the Russian economy, are determined to keep them in place as long as necessary, even for years. Vladimir Putin cannot upend over 70 years of stability and growth and prosperity for the world and expect to continue to benefit from that stability, growth and prosperity. Ukraine’s counteroffensive northeast of Kharkiv has likely forced Russian troops to redeploy to the city instead of reinforcing stalled Russian offensive operations elsewhere in eastern Ukraine, the Institute of War has said in its latest analysis of the conflict. Russian forces are likely amassing in Belgorod to deploy to the Kharkiv City region to prevent the Ukrainian counteroffensive in the area from reaching the international border. Russian forces were also continuing their attempt to reach the administrative borders of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts but have not made substantial territorial gains since securing Popasna on Saturday, the US-based think tank added. Other potential developments to look out for were: Russian forces will likely continue to merge offensive efforts southward of Izyum with westward advances from Donetsk in order to encircle Ukrainian troops in southern Kharkiv oblast and Western Donetsk. Russia may change the status of the Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, possibly by merging them into a single “Donbas Republic” and/or by annexing them directly to Russia. Russian forces have apparently decided to seize the Azovstal plant through ground assault and will likely continue operations accordingly. Russian forces may be preparing to conduct renewed offensive operations to capture the entirety of Kherson oblast in the coming days. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy presented Ukraine’s famous mine sniffing dog Patron and his owner with a medal on Sunday to recognise their dedicated service since Russia’s invasion, Reuters has reported. The pint-size Jack Russell terrier has been credited with detecting more than 200 explosives and preventing their detonation since the start of the war on 24 February, quickly becoming a canine symbol of Ukrainian patriotism. Zelenskiy made the award at a news conference in Kyiv with Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau. Patron barked and wagged his tail, prompting laughter from the audience. Trudeau patted his pockets as though looking for a dog treat. “Today, I want to award those Ukrainian heroes who are already clearing our land of mines. And together with our heroes, a wonderful little sapper – Patron – who helps not only to neutralise explosives, but also to teach our children the necessary safety rules in areas where there is a mine threat,” Zelenskiy said in a statement after the ceremony. The award also went to Patron’s owner, a major in the Civil Protection Service, Myhailo Iliev. An update from one of the Guardian’s correspondents in Ukraine, Emma Graham Harrison, on the evacuees from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol: The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200 kilometres took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside interrogated. “I didn’t think we would make it out alive, so I don’t have any plans for my future,” said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant all her adult life and then sheltered for over two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. “I wouldn’t have given them up even if they shot me. About 36 hours later the group filed slowly off the buses into the late evening dark, and fell upon a hot meal prepared in the registration tent. It also had clothes and toys, as most people fled with just a couple of bags. “It is a breath of fresh air to be on Ukrainian-held land,” said Tatiana, who fled with her daughter and granddaughter. Read on here: The Guardian’s Ed Ram has managed to take some pictures of the civilians evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks to Zaporizhzhia: Vladimir Putin’s regime is “mirroring” the actions of the Nazis, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, will say as the Russian leader stages a military parade to celebrate victory over Hitler’s fascists, according to an advance copy of the speech. In a speech on Monday, Wallace will say president Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities. In Moscow, Putin will watch the Victory Day parade of military hardware, marking the defeat of the Nazis in 1945. According to extracts briefed to the Telegraph and Times, Wallace will say: “Through their invasion of Ukraine, Putin, his inner circle and generals are now mirroring the fascism and tyranny of 70 years ago, repeating the errors of last century’s totalitarian regimes. “Their fate must also, surely, eventually be the same.” Read on here in this report by PA’s political editor David Hughes: Hello, this is Helen Livingstone taking over from my colleague Vivian Ho to bring you the latest developments from the conflict in Ukraine. “Russia will lose, because evil always loses,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address on Sunday, 8 May, when Ukraine marks the end of the second world war with its remembrance and reconciliation day. The main thing I felt today was the world’s even greater willingness to help us. And the fact that we have already achieved a historic result, because it is clear to the whole free world that Ukraine is the party of good in this war. Russia marks its second world war Victory Day on 9 May, Zelenskiy noted, “when peace should be the main word. For all normal people.” But he said, Russia had killed about 60 people in a “targeted” airstrike on a school in Luhansk, while another missile struck a residential building in the Odesa region. There was further shelling in the regions Sumy, the Donbas and Kharkiv. The Russian army would not be itself if it did not kill today - on the eve of certainly important days for any European. He also thanked Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau, who along with several other western leaders visited Kyiv on Sunday, saying that they had agreed to expand economic and defence cooperation and Canada had made the “extremely important decision” to remove all barriers to trade for one year. He also said that Canada had “a strong potential in mine clearance” and that “we expect that this potential will be used in Ukraine - where the Russian occupiers left thousands of mines, tripwire mines, shells.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed that 60 people who were sheltering in a school in Bilohorivka were killed when Russian forces bombed it this weekend. The United Nations has condemned the attack, with secretary-general António Guterres saying he was “appalled” by it. More than 170 civilians were successfully evacuated from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol and have arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Officials said that more than 600 people have been evacuated from Azovstal and Mariupol in total. Members of Ukraine’s Azov battalion trapped inside Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant meanwhile said they fear they will be killed if captured by Russian forces, as they pleaded with Ukrainian authorities to help arrange their extraction. Speaking to the media from inside the besieged steelworks, Lieut Illya Samoilenko vowed to fight on, saying that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. US president Joe Biden and other G7 leaders held a video call with Zelenskiy in a show of unity ahead of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations on Monday. The G7 said it was committed to phasing out or banning Russian oil and denounced president Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. “His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people,” the group said in a statement, referring to Soviet Russia’s role in defeating Nazi Germany 77 years ago. New US visa bans on more than 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials include personnel believed to have operated in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that has become synonymous with war crimes, US secretary of state Antony Blinken said. America’s top diplomat to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien, arrived with her team in Kyiv today in a step towards resuming the country’s presence in the capital. The visit was timed to commemorate Victory in Europe Day on Sunday. Russian airstrikes on Sunday wounded one woman and knocked out electricity to six settlements in the Odesa oblast, authorities said. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau promised new weapons and other equipment for Ukraine after a surprise visit to the country during which he toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia was among western leaders who made. He also said Canada would remove trade tariffs on all Ukrainian imports to Canada for next year. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Berlin had “made a mistake” after it banned all flags including Ukrainian flags as part of its decision to suppress all displays of public support for the Russian invasion on Victory Day. “Taking a Ukrainian flag away from peaceful protestors is an attack on everyone who now defends Europe and Germany from Russian aggression with this flag in hands.” The US president’s wife, Jill Biden, met with Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska on another unannounced visit on Sunday to mark Mother’s Day. Meanwhile U2’s Bono and the Edge performed in a Kyiv bomb shelter. In an address to mark Ukraine’s 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. “This year we say ‘Never again’ differently. We hear ‘Never again’ differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.” Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Scholz, whose relations with Zelenskiy have been frosty, has not yet said whether he will accept an invitation to travel to Kyiv on Monday. The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. Vladimir Putin’s regime is “mirroring” the actions of the Nazis, the UK’s defence secretary, Ben Wallace, will say on Monday as the Russian leader stages a military parade to celebrate Russia’s second world war victory, according to an advance copy of the speech. Wallace will say president Putin and his inner circle should share the same fate as the Nazis, who ended up defeated and facing the Nuremberg trials for their atrocities. Emmanuel Macron, the French president, is set to travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz on Monday and to make a major address. Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, was one of several western leaders who made a surprise visit to Ukraine today. During his visit, he announced that Canada would be providing an additional $50m in military assistance. US first lady Jill Biden met today with Olena Zelenska, wife of Volodymyr Zelenskiy, outside a public school in Uzhhorod. Here are some photos: Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed late Sunday what many had feared but were hoping would not be true: 60 people who were sheltering in the Bilohorivka school that Russian forces bombed this weekend were killed in the attack. About 90 people had been sheltering in that school at the time of the attack. António Guterres, secretary-general of the United Nations, issued a statement Sunday saying he was “appalled” by the attack on the school. “This attack is yet another reminder that in this war, as in so many other conflicts, it is civilians that pay the highest price,” said Stéphane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general. Read more here: After today’s successful arrival in Zaporizhzhia, the total number of people evacuated from Azovstal and Mariupol is now more than 600. Mykhaylo Podolyak, aide to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said on Twitter that they “won’t stop until we evacuate all our people” from Azovstal. “The life of every defender is sacred to the Ukrainian state,” he said. “Every conversation of the president with the leaders of the world begins with the word ‘Azovstal’,” Podolyak said. “We calculate all formats, and if the history of international law does not know such formats - we offer new ones. We managed to get women and children out of the factory, but we will not stop until we get everyone out.” Kyiv has responded to Berlin police confiscating a Ukrainian flag today in Germany. To recap: with tensions heightened on the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender in World War II, the city of Berlin decided to suppress all public displays of support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine - everything from Russian flags to the beeping of horns at car rallies. Officials included Ukrainian flags under this decision, and earlier today police were filmed confiscating a large flag. After weeks of living under siege, more than 170 civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have arrived in Zaporizhzhia. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said yesterday that more than 300 civilians had been rescued from Azovstal. But Reuters is reporting that captain Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, cannot say for certain if all civilians have been evacuated from the plant as Ukrainian fighters are not able to check and clear all the bombed areas. Antony Blinken, US secretary of state, said on Sunday that the new US visa bans on more than 2,600 Russian and Belarusian military officials include personnel believed to have operated in Bucha, the town outside Kyiv that has become synonymous with war crimes. Images that emerged from Bucha after Ukrainian forces retook the region showed bodies lying in the streets or half-buried in mass graves. The corpses of civilians displayed signs of torture, some blindfolded with their hands tied behind their backs when they were shot and killed in an execution style. Reuters reported that when announcing the visa restrictions on 2,596 Russian military officials and 13 Belarusian ones, Blinken made a point to say that “included among this group are personnel who reportedly took part in Russian military activities in Bucha, the horrors of which have shocked the world”. Russian officials have said the killings were faked. Volodymyr Zelenskiy met today with G7 leaders via video conference to discuss the war in Ukraine. Downing Street has just released a readout from the meeting, noting that Boris Johnson “agreed with G7 leaders that the world must intensify economic pressure on Putin in any way possible, and said the west must not allow the war to turn into a stalemate that only magnified suffering.” “Ukraine needed to receive military equipment that allowed them to not just hold ground in Ukraine, but recapture it, the Prime Minister told the leaders,” a Downing Street spokeswoman said. Meanwhile, on Twitter, Emmanuel Macron, president of France, said the objective of the video conference was the “respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine. This war must end!” “Sanctions taken by G7 members against Russia are unprecedented,” Macron said. “They will get even stronger. We pledge today to phase out our dependence on Russian energy.” The ministry of culture and information policy of Ukraine has an ongoing thread on the churches and temples destroyed so far in the Russian invasion. The list is lengthy and the damaged holy sites are spread all around the country. They include a burned-down church in the Kyiv region that was built in 1873, a wooden 160-year-old church that was destroyed in the Zhytomyr Oblast and the chapel of the Holy Martyr Tatiana that was damaged in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol. Russian airstrikes on Sunday wounded one woman and knocked out electricity to six settlements in the Odesa oblast, authorities said. U2’s Bono and the Edge performed in a bomb shelter in Kyiv today. Here’s some video of their performance: As expected, the atmosphere in Germany continues to be tense, with police in Berlin confiscating a Ukrainian flag today as part of the city’s decision to include Ukrainian flags in their suppression of public displays of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender in World War II. The Guardian’s Philip Oltermann reported earlier that politicians were avoiding gatherings marking the anniversary, amid fears that commemorative events could be used for propaganda purposes. Vladimir Putin has tried to justify his invasion Ukraine by claiming he was going to “de-nazify” the country. Meanwhile, Germany has been criticized for not taking a hard enough stance against Russia, especially in divesting from Russian oil. The Ukrainian ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, called the ban on the Ukrainian flag “a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people”. The US has announced new sanctions on Russia - including against three Russian television stations, Gazprombank executives and a ban on Americans providing accounting and consulting services to Russians. Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with G7 leaders today to discuss the war in Ukraine and new measures to punish Moscow. The US president, Joe Biden, was due to meet leaders at 11am ET (3pm GMT) from his home in Delaware. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made an unannounced visit today to the Ukrainian town of Irpin. Irpin was retaken from Russian troops in late March following fierce fighting. Jill Biden has made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine to visit the Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska to show US support on Mother’s Day. Ukrainian forces at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have vowed to continue fighting for “as long as we are alive”. Capt Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commander of Ukraine’s Azov Regiment, also pleaded with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has strongly condemned Russian shelling of a school in Bilohorivka, which is thought to have been sheltering 60 people. In a post on Twitter the ministry said: “#Russia committed this brutal war crime shortly before the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, constantly repeating the tragedy of World War II. #StopRussianWar” President Zelenskiy has compared Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to the actions of the Nazis in the second world war, as Ukraine marks its 8 May Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. At least two people have been killed and 60 more are feared dead after Russian bombs hit a school in the Ukrainian village of Bilohorivka, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk, said on Sunday. Gaidai said Russia dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school where about 90 people were sheltering, causing a fire that engulfed the building. Thirty people have been rescued. That’s it from me, Miranda, for today. Handing over now to Vivian Ho. Thanks for reading. G7 leaders have released a joint statement in which they pledged to reinforce Russia’s economic isolation and “elevate” a campaign against Russian elites who support its president, Vladimir Putin, reports Reuters. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has said that today was an 8 May “like no other”, as he condemned Russia’s “barbaric” invasion of Ukraine. “We support Ukraine in the fight against the aggressor,” he said, in comments marking Victory in Europe day. “Not doing so would mean capitulating to sheer violence and empowering the aggressor.” He told the German public that “fear must not paralyse us” and said he was “deeply convinced” that Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, will not win the war. “Ukraine will survive,” he said. “Freedom and security will prevail - just as freedom and security triumphed over lack of freedom, violence and dictatorship 77 years ago.” The US has announced new sanctions on Russia - including against three Russian television stations, Gazprombank executives and a ban on Americans providing accounting and consulting services to Russians. The latest effort to increase pressure on Vladimir Putin came as Joe Biden and other G7 leaders met virtually with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to discuss the war. “This is not a full block. We’re not freezing the assets of Gazprombank or prohibiting any transactions with Gazprombank,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters. “What we’re signalling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, and so we’re sanctioning some of their top business executives ... to create a chilling effect.” Eight executives from Sberbank, which holds one-third of Russia’s banking assets, were added to the sanctions list, reports Reuters. Moscow Industrial Bank and its 10 subsidiaries were also added. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, was on CNN’s State of the Union show this morning. Asked by anchor Jake Tapper if the Russian air raid on a village school in eastern Ukraine this weekend, that is feared to have killed as many as 60 of the 90 civilians sheltering there, is a war crime, she said: We [the US] have called out Russia very early on for committing war crimes and this contributes to that. She added: We are going to continue to work with the Ukrainian prosecutors to document evidence of their [Russia’s] war crimes so they can be held accountable. This just adds to the long list we already have. US president Joe Biden first said in mid-March that he now regarded Russian president Vladimir Putin as a war criminal. “I think he is a war criminal,” Biden told a reporter who asked him about Putin, following a searing address and plea for aid by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy to the US Congress by video, on March 16, playing a video that showed graphic images of Ukrainian civilians slain in Russia’s attacks on the country. Then in early April, Biden called for Putin to be tried for war crimes, after evidence emerged of atrocities including rape and summary executions of Ukrainian civilians by the Russian military during its brief but barbaric occupation of Bucha, on the outskirts of the capital Kyiv. Biden called Putin “brutal”. The US first lady, Jill Biden, has shared a photo of herself with her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska, saying: “My heart is with you”. America’s top diplomat to Ukraine, Kristina Kvien, arrived with her team in Kyiv today in a step towards resuming the country’s presence in the capital. The announcemen, by a senior state department official, comes after the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, last month pledged to reopen Kyiv’s US embassy soon. The latest visit was timed to commemorate Victory in Europe Day on Sunday, the official said, reports Reuters. Russia celebrates the 1945 defeat of Nazi Germany on its Victory Day on Monday. Volodymyr Zelenskiy met with G7 leaders today to discuss the war in Ukraine and new measures to punish Moscow. The US president, Joe Biden, was due to meet leaders at 11am ET (3pm GMT) from his home in Delaware. A White House official said the meeting was underway, reports Reuters. The White House said leaders planned to discuss further sanctions on Russia. It said in a statement: They will discuss the latest developments in Russia’s war against Ukraine; the global impact of Putin’s war; showing support for Ukraine and Ukraine’s future; and demonstrating continued G7 unity in our collective response, including building on our unprecedented sanctions to impose severe costs for Putin’s war. The meeting comes ahead of Russia’s Victory Day celebrations tomorrow. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made an unannounced visit today to the Ukrainian town of Irpin. Irpin was retaken from Russian troops in late March following fierce fighting. The town’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, made the announcement of Trudeau’s visit on Telegram: I’ve just had an honour to meet with the Prime Minister of Canada Justin Trudeau, who came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror which Russian occupiers have caused to our town. He also posted a picture of Trudeau standing on a street to the backdrop of destroyed apartment buildings. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has said that he has discussed the unblocking of Ukraine’s food exports with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in a bid to ensure global food security. Before the war Ukraine, one of the world’s major sources of grain and oilseeds, used to export most of its cereals through its Black Sea ports. But they have been blocked since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Michael Clarke, a visiting professor of defence studies, at King’s College London, has written a really interesting piece for the BBC arguing that Putin faces only different kinds of defeat. Here’s a short extract of his conclusion, but you can read the whole piece here: Any significant Russian military success will likely create a major, open-ended insurgency that will get bigge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 for every district Russian forces may overrun. Putin went for broke in February with Plan A. The failure of that scheme means that plans B, C or any subsequent plans still leaves Russia going for broke - needing to suppress some or all of a very big country. One way or another, Russia will have to keep fighting in Ukraine, either against the population, or against the Ukrainian army, and quite possibly both simultaneously. And as long as Kyiv sticks to its current line that demands Russian withdrawal before any concessions can be contemplated, there is not much Putin can do but carry grimly on. Jill Biden has made an unannounced visit to western Ukraine to visit the Ukranian first lady, Olena Zelenska to show US support on Mother’s Day. The US first lady told Zelenska: I wanted to come on Mother’s Day. I thought it was important to show the Ukrainian people that this war has to stop and this war has been brutal and that the people of the United States stand with the people of Ukraine. The Associated Press reports: Biden spent about two hours in Ukraine, traveling by vehicle to the town of Uzhhorod, about a 10-minute drive from a Slovakian village that she toured on the border. Zelenska thanked Biden for her “courageous act” and said: We understand what it takes for the US first lady to come here during a war when military actions are taking place every day, where the air sirens are happening every day – even today. The two first ladies came together in a small classroom, sitting across a table from one another and greeting each other in front of reporters before they met in private. Zelenska and her children have been at an undisclosed location for their safety. The school where they met has been turned into transitional housing for Ukrainian migrants from elsewhere in the country. The visit allowed Biden to conduct the kind of personal diplomacy that her husband would like to be doing himself. President Joe Biden said during his visit to Poland in March that he was disappointed he could not visit Ukraine to see conditions “first-hand” but that he was not allowed, likely due to security reasons. The White House said as recently as last week that the president “would love to visit” but there were no plans for him to do so at this time. The meeting came about after the two first ladies exchanged correspondence in recent weeks, according to US officials who declined to provide further details because they were not authorised to discuss the ladies’ private communications. As she arrived at the school, Biden, who was wearing a Mother’s Day corsage that was a gift from her husband, embraced Zelenska and presented her with a bouquet. After their private meeting, the two joined a group of children who live at the school in making tissue-paper bears to give as Mother’s Day gifts. Biden’s visit follows recent stops in the war-torn country by US house Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other members of Congress, as well as a joint trip by US secretary of state Antony Blinken and US defence secretary Lloyd Austin to meet with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv. Her visit was limited to western Ukraine; Russia is concentrating its military power in eastern Ukraine, and she was not in harm’s way. On the same day as Biden’s visit, a Russian bomb flattened a school in eastern Ukraine that had been sheltering about 90 people in its basement, with dozens feared dead. Earlier, in the Slovakian border village of Vysne Nemecke, she toured its border processing facility, surveying operations set up by the United Nations and other relief organizations to assist Ukrainians seeking refuge. Biden attended a religious service in a tent set up as a chapel, where a priest intoned, “We pray for the people of Ukraine.” And before that, in Kosice, Biden met and offered support to Ukrainian mothers in Slovakia who have been displaced by Russia’s war. She assured them that the “hearts of the American people” are behind them. At a bus station in the city that is now a 24-hour refugee processing center, Biden found herself in an extended conversation with a Ukrainian woman who said she struggles to explain the war to her three children because she cannot understand it herself. “I cannot explain because I don’t know myself and I’m a teacher,” Victorie Kutocha, who had her arms around her seven-year-old daughter, Yulie, told Biden. At one point, Kutocha asked, “Why?” seeming to seek an explanation for Russia’s decision to invade Ukraine on 24 February. ‘It’s so hard to understand,” the first lady replied. The 24-hour facility is one of six refugee centers in Slovakia, providing an average of 300 to 350 people daily with food, showers, clothing, emergency on-site accommodations and other services, according to information provided by the White House. Biden also dropped in at a Slovakian public school that has taken in displaced students. Slovakian and Ukrainian moms were brought together at the school for a Mother’s Day event while their children made crafts to give them as gifts. Biden went from table to table meeting the mothers and kids. She told some of the women that she wanted to come and “ say the hearts of the American people are with the mothers of Ukraine.” “I just wanted to come and show you our support,” she said before departing for Vysne Nemecke. Biden is on a four-day visit to Eastern Europe to highlight U.S. support for Ukrainian refugees and for the allied countries such as Romania and Slovakia that are providing a safe haven for them. She spent Friday and Saturday in Romania, visiting with U.S. troops and meeting with Ukrainian refugee mothers and children. A little bit of positivity for Kyiv residents today, well the U2 fans among them at least, as Bono and The Edge from the band performed in a bomb shelter in Ukraine’s capital. The Dublin band, who said they were invited to perform by president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, shared the news in a post on Twitter: Bono and guitarist The Edge played with Ukrainian band, Antytila to a small crowd. They performed the Ben E King classic Stand By Me and other songs in the subway station that now serves as a bomb shelter. This made me cry: The Associated Press have filed this report from Russia, as it celebrates Victory Day, which marks the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945: AP reports: Red Soviet flags and orange-and-black striped military ribbons are on display in Russian cities and towns. Neighbourhoods are staging holiday concerts. Flowers are being laid by veterans’ groups at monuments to the Great Patriotic War, as the second world war is known in the country. At first glance, preparations for Monday’s celebration of Victory Day, marking the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, seem to be the same as ever. But the mood this year is very different, because Russian troops are fighting and dying again. And this battle, now in its 11th week, is going on in neighbouring Ukraine, against what the government has falsely called a campaign against “Nazis”. The pride and patriotism usually associated with Russia’s most important holiday, marked by a huge parade of soldiers and military hardware through Red Square, is mixing with apprehension and unease over what this year’s Victory Day may bring. Some Russians fear that President Vladimir Putin will use it to declare that what the Kremlin has previously called a “special military operation” in Ukraine will now be a fully-fledged war – bringing with it a broad mobilisation of troops to bolster Russia’s forces. Historian Ivan Kurilla wrote on Facebook: I can’t remember a time when the May 9 holiday was anticipated with such anxiety. Ukraine’s intelligence chief, Kyrylo Budanov, said Moscow was covertly preparing such a plan. British defence secretary Ben Wallace told LBC Radio that Putin was “laying the ground for being able to say, Look, this is now a war against Nazis, and what I need is more people.’” The Kremlin denied having such plans, calling the reports “untrue” and “nonsense”. Asked by the Associated Press on Friday whether mobilisation rumours could dampen the Victory Day mood, Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said “nothing will cast a shadow” over “the sacred day, the most important day” for Russians. Still, human rights groups reported a rise in calls from people asking about laws concerning mobilisation and their rights in case of being ordered to join the military. Pavel Chikov, founder of the Agora legal aid group, on the messaging app Telegram, said: Questions about who can be called up and how have started to flow on a mass scale through our hotline about the rights of conscripts and the military. Russian state TV has ramped up the patriotic rhetoric. In announcing the 24 February military operation, Putin declared it was aimed at the “demilitarisation” of Ukraine to remove a perceived military threat to Russia by “neo-Nazis”. A recent TV commentary said Putin’s words were “not an abstract thing and not a slogan” and praised Russia’s success in Ukraine, even though Moscow’s troops have gotten bogged down, making only minor gains in recent weeks. Ukraine, which has a democratically elected Jewish president who lost relatives in the Holocaust, and the West have condemned the remarks as a fictitious cover for a blunt act of aggression. But many Russians fed a steady diet of the official narrative have cheered on their troops, comparing them to “our grandfathers” who fought the Germans. Popular support in Russia for the war in Ukraine is difficult to gauge in a country that has seen a steady crackdown on journalists in recent years, with independent media outlets shut down and state-controlled television providing a pervasive influence. A recent poll by the respected independent Levada Center found that 82% of Russians remain concerned by the military campaign in Ukraine. The vast majority of them 47% are worried about the deaths of civilians and Russian soldiers in the war, along with the devastation and suffering. Only 6% of those concerned by the war said they were bothered by the alleged presence of “Nazis” and “fascists” in Ukraine. In a recent commentary.political analyst Andrei Kolesnikov said: A significant part of the population is horrified, and even those who support the war are in a permanent psychological militant state of a perpetual nightmare. A government campaign encouraging support for the military is using the distinctive black-and-orange St. George’s ribbon that is traditionally associated with Victory Day. The letter “Z” has become a symbol of the conflict, decorating buildings, posters and billboards across Russia, and many forms of it use the ribbon’s colours and pattern. Rallies supporting the troops have taken place in recent days at second world war memorials, with participants singing songs from the 1940s. One official has suggested that Victory Day marchers display photos of soldiers now fighting in Ukraine. Normally on the holiday, Russians carry portraits of their relatives who took part in the second world war to honour those in the so-called “Immortal Regiment” from a conflict in which the Soviet Union lost a staggering 27 million people. Katerina Sergatskova, editor-in-chief at Zaborona Media, (an independent media outlet covering social trends and culture in post-socialist countries in Eastern Europe) has tweeted a thread of the main points made in the press conference: Here are the quotes she picks out from a press conference by the commanders of Azov regiment in he Azovstal plant in Mariupol. This is an unverified translation: Civilians were evacuated in three days recently. We do not know if everyone was evacuated. From politicians we hear that it was success. But during the evacuation two servicemen were killed and six injured. This is the price of the evacuation of civilians. [...] On the territory of the Azovstal plant there are many civilian and military casualties, and tens of thousands of citizens died as a result of Russia’s actions during 2,5 months, they didn’t have a chance to be evacuated timely. [...] We have been asking for the evacuation of civilians for 2.5 months, and only now we have managed to evacuate several hundred. It is joy through tears. [...] No one expected us to stand for so long. Our government failed to save Mariupol. We are called heroes, and we should not flaunt it, because we do our job. The heroes are next to me. Many people gave their lives for the city, for the state and for the citizens of Ukraine. [...] We could retreat from Mariupol, because we saw what a dangerous situation. But we decided to stay here, and we had an order to defend Mariupol. [...] Many government officials have been sabotaging Ukraine’s defense for eight years. Everyone interfered, we knew that a great war with Russia was coming, and we were preparing. We didn’t get Javelins or coaches, we collected everything ourselves: information, ammunition. [...] We (Azov) were called a paramilitary group and radicals [by the West, as well as RU propaganda].Where we were radicals is in defending our country. We did great damage to the enemy. We received no help: no artillery or aircraft. We were left alone and we were alone for 8 years. [...] We know our past. We have been volunteers since 2014, there were many different people. But we decided to leave our past behind and become professional military. We wanted to create a new modern Ukrainian army, and trained as it should, at the highest level. [...] We are located 100 kilometers from the main Ukrainian positions. It is a shame to run away from here. Another option is to lay down your arms and surrender. The last option is to stand and fight. [...] We knew that the Azov Regiment had no high chance of survival. We cannot surrender and give up to the enemy. Because every POW is a resource for exchange to increase the level of political negotiations. They take away attention from another, it is a scattering of attention. [...] Moreover, not so long ago in April, Russian propaganda showed that they had captured Azov soldier. He had a large tattoo on his shoulder. They showed that he was alive, and a few days later sent a message to his mother that he had been strangled to death. They always do. [...] Russians are not interested in our lives. At the time, we had a lot of Russian POWs, and they are in the exchange fund, they are alive. We keep the agreements, the Russians do not. [...] We are fighting for a free world here. If #Russia will crash #Ukraine, and #Mariupol is the main location in this war, they will go further: to Poland, to the Baltic countries. Ukrainian forces at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol have vowed to continue fighting for “as long as we are alive”. Capt Sviatoslav Palamar, a deputy commandor of Ukraine’s Azov Regiment, also pleaded with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers. He told an online conference: We will continue to fight as long as we are alive to repel the Russian occupiers. Calling for urgency to evacuate wounded soldiers, he said: We don’t have much time, we are coming under intense shelling. Moscow residents appeared anxious but resilient as Russia prepared to celebrate Victory Day on Monday, reports Reuters. “Emotionally it affects you because I have two sisters living in Ukraine,” said Larisa. “Of course, it is very difficult to communicate with them now – very difficult. They have their own information war going on now.” She added: “In Russia as a whole, there is a lot of cohesion now among the masses in connection with these events: what I can say is that patriotism is growing.” According to opinion polls, most Russians support the military operation and president Vladimir Putin’s approval rating has risen more than 14 points to 81.5% since the start of the war in Ukraine. Manoeuvres update: Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday its forces had destroyed a Ukrainian navy ship near Odesa with a missile strike overnight, and had destroyed four Ukrainian warplanes, four helicopters and an assault boat in the past 24 hours. Ukraine said its forces had repulsed nine Russian attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk, destroying 19 tanks and 20 combat vehicles. The Luhansk governor said Ukrainian forces had retreated from the city of Popasna, which has been the focus of intense fighting. “Everything was destroyed there. Our troops retreated to more fortified positions,” he told Ukrainian television. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, said earlier his soldiers had taken control of most of Popasna. We are getting more details from the Russian bombing of a village school in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk, where as many as 60 people are feared to have been killed. Governor Serhiy Gaidai said Russian forces dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school in Bilohorivka where about 90 people were sheltering, sparking a fire that engulfed the building. Writing on the Telegram messaging app, Gaidai said: The fire was extinguished after nearly four hours, then the rubble was cleared, and, unfortunately, the bodies of two people were found. Thirty people were evacuated from the rubble, seven of whom were injured. Sixty people were likely to have died under the rubble of buildings. Mariana Betsa, a former spokesperson for the Ukranian ministry of foreign affairs, now Ukrainian ambassador to Estonia, posted this footage, which appears to show the destroyed school: Ukrainian politician Serhiy Prytula posted: Ukrainian troops have retreated from the eastern city of Popasna, the governor of Luhansk region said on Sunday, confirming previous reports that it had been taken. Reuters reports: The head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, had said on Sunday his troops had taken control of most of Popasna. Luhansk governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukraine television that Ukrainian troops had retreated to take up more fortified positions. Russian forces launched a new offensive in April along most of Ukraine’s eastern flank, with some of the most intense attacks and shelling taking place around Popasna in the Luhansk region. Independent Ukrainian media outlet Hromadske reported him saying: Ukrainian troops withdrew a little from Popasna because the city was under shelling for more than two months. Everything is destroyed there. That’s why Ukrainian troops retreated to stronger positions, which were prepared in advance. The UK government is scrambling to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because the people they were supposed to stay with have been deemed “unsuitable”, the Observer can reveal. Refugee charities have warned since the scheme’s launch that with most of the refugees being women and children, and many matches made on social media websites such as Facebook, the scheme risked being targeted by predatory men. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), which runs the scheme, has insisted that no visa is issued until the Home Office has completed checks on every adult in a sponsor household. However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is “looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable”. This included sponsors with a criminal record. Utterly gut-wrenching reporting from the Sunday Times Chief Foreign correspondent Christina Lamb today, who reports from a small village an hour north-west of Kyiv. It’s a very distressing read of rape, murder and brutalisation, but an important one. Politicians in Berlin are to stay away from gatherings celebrating the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender in 1945 this year, amid fears that commerative events could be used for propaganda purposes. Justifying her and her senators’ absence at the traditional wreath-layings at the Soviet War Memorial in Berlin’s Treptower Park Berlin’s mayor Franziska Giffey said: The situation is very oppressive, and any commemorations have to take that into account. The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the wreath-layings in the past, has not made its plans public this year due to security concerns. Germany’s surrender in WW2 is traditionally celebrated in Germany and western Europe on 8 May. Due to time difference, the event is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. Berlin’s senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites is banned. The city’s decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the Ukrainian ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was “a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people”. A protest march against Russia’s invasion, entitled “No to the war in Ukraine”, has been registered at the Brandenburg Gate on Sunday. The Institute for the Study of War has predicted that Ukrainian forces in Kharkiv oblast are likely to advance to the Russian border in the coming days or weeks. According to a recent report by the US thinktank, the Ukrainian counter-offensive north-east of Kharkiv is making significant progress. The report, written by Mason Clark, Karolina Hird and Kateryna Stepanenko, states its “key takeaways”: Russian forces destroyed several bridges to slow Ukrainian forces and may be conducting a limited withdrawal north-east of Kharkiv city in the face of the successful Ukrainian counter-offensive. Ukrainian forces are making significant progress around Kharkiv and will likely advance to the Russian border in the coming days. Ukrainian forces continued to repel Russian advances toward Barvinvoke and Russian forces have likely abandoned efforts to drive directly south-east toward Slovyansk. ISW cannot confirm claims of a Ukrainian counter-offensive toward Izyum at this time. Russian forces claimed to capture Popasna on May 7 but remain largely stalled in eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian government confirmed the last remaining civilians trapped in the Azovstal plant evacuated on May 7, though the remaining Ukrainian defenders appear unlikely to surrender. ISW will likely be unable to report any discrete changes in control of terrain until Russian forces capture the plant as a whole due to the poor information environment in Mariupol. By all indications, Russian forces will announce the creation of a Kherson people’s republic or possibly forcibly annex Kherson Oblast in the coming weeks to cement its occupation administration and attempt to permanently strip these territories from Ukraine. Russian forces continued to target Odesa with cruise missile strikes and conduct false-flag attacks in Transnistria over the past several days. The leader of Germany’s Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, has arrived in Kyiv to honour second world war victims and hold talks with Ukrainian authorities about supporting the country further. The governor of Ukraine’s Luhansk region has said he is “hoping for the best” that there will be survivors following a Russian airstrike on the school sheltering civilians in the village of Bilohorivka. Serhiy Haidai told reporters: An aircraft bomb went into a school. Unfortunately, it is completely destroyed … There were 60 people hiding from the shelling … Considering it was an aircraft bomb, not an artillery shell, when the explosion happened, the temperature was wild. Of course, our state service emergency workers will try to clear the debris as fast as they can, but the chances of people still being alive are small. But we hope for the best. A bit later, when the debris is cleared, I will report on the situation. Maybe, someone will actually stay alive. If you missed Daniel Boffey’s heartbreaking report on the last days of the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, do it give it a read. “Holding up”, wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna,27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband’s last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. My colleague Daniel Boffey, who is in Kyiv, has been in touch this morning, and has supplied me with the text of Volodymr Zelenskiy’s 8 May address this morning entitled “Address by the President of Ukraine on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation”. Here it is in full: Can spring be black and white? Is there eternal February? Are golden words devalued? Unfortunately, Ukraine knows the answers to all these questions. Unfortunately, the answers are “yes”. Every year on May 8, together with the entire civilized world, we honor everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during World War II. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. This year we say “Never again” differently. We hear “Never again” differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it. On February 24, the word “never” was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again! The city of Borodyanka is one of the many victims of this crime! Behind me is one of many witnesses! Not a military facility, not a secret base, but a simple nine-storey building. Can it pose a security threat to Russia, to 1/8 of the land, the world’s second army, a nuclear state? Can anything be more absurd than this question? It can. 250kg high explosive bombs, with which the superpower shelled this small town. And it went numb. It cannot say today: never again! It cannot say anything today. But here everything is clear without words. Just look at this house. There used to be walls here. They once had photos on them. And in the photos there were those who once went through the hell of war. Fifty men who were sent to Germany for forced labor. Those who were burned alive when the Nazis burned more than 100 houses here. 250 soldiers who died on the fronts of World War II, and a total of almost 1,000 residents of Borodyanka who fought and defeated Nazism. To ensure: never again. They fought for the future of children, for the life that was here until February 24. Imagine people going to bed in each of these apartments. They wish good night to each other. Turn off the light. Hug their loved ones. Close their eyes. They dream of something. There is complete silence. They all fall asleep, not knowing that not everyone will wake up. They sleep soundly. They have a dream of something pleasant. But in a few hours they will be awakened by missile explosions. And someone will never wake up again. Never again. The word “never” was dropped from this slogan. Amputated during the so-called special operation. They stabbed a knife in the heart and, looking into the eyes, said: “It’s not us!” Tortured with the words “not everything is so unambiguous.” Killed “Never again”, saying: “We can repeat.” And so it happened. And the monsters began to repeat. And our cities, which survived such a heinous occupation that 80 years are not enough to forget about it, saw the occupier again. And got the second date of occupation in their history. And some cities, such as Mariupol, got the third. During the two years of occupation, the Nazis killed 10,000 civilians there. In two months of occupation, Russia killed 20,000. Decades after World War II, darkness returned to Ukraine. And it became black and white again. Again! Evil has returned. Again! In a different uniform, under different slogans, but for the same purpose. A bloody reconstruction of Nazism was organized in Ukraine. A fanatical repetition of this regime. Its ideas, actions, words and symbols. Maniacal detailed reproduction of its atrocities and “alibi”, which allegedly give an evil sacred purpose. Repetition of its crimes and even attempts to surpass the “teacher” and move him from the pedestal of the greatest evil in human history. Set a new world record for xenophobia, hatred, racism and the number of victims they can cause. Never again! It was an ode of a wise man! Anthem of the civilized world! But someone sang out of tune. Distorted “Never again” with notes of doubt. Silenced, beginning his deadly aria of evil. And this is clear to all countries that have seen the horrors of Nazism with their own eyes. And today they are experiencing a terrible deja vu. See it again! All nations who have been branded “third-class”, slaves without the right to their own state or to exist at all hear statements that exalt one nation and erase others with ease. They claim that you don’t really exist, you are artificially created, and therefore you have no rights. Everyone hears the language of evil. Again! And together they acknowledge the painful truth: we have not withstood even a century. Our Never again was enough for 77 years. We missed the evil. It was reborn. Again and now! This is understood by all countries and nations who support Ukraine today. And despite the new mask of the beast, they recognized him. Because, unlike some, they remember what our ancestors fought for and against. They did not confuse the first with the second, did not change their places, did not forget. The Poles didn’t forget, on whose land the Nazis began their march and fired the first shot of World War II. Didn’t forget how evil first accuses you, provokes you, calls you an aggressor, and then attacks at 4.45am saying it’s self-defense. And they saw how it repeated on our land. They remember the Nazi-destroyed Warsaw. And they see what was done to Mariupol. The British people did not forget how the Nazis wiped out Coventry, which was bombed 41 times. How the “Moonlight Sonata” from the Luftwaffe sounded, when the city was continuously bombed for 11 hours. How its historic center, factories, St. Michael’s Cathedral were destroyed. And they saw missiles hit Kharkiv. How its historic center, factories and the Assumption Cathedral were damaged. They remember London being bombed for 57 nights in a row. Remember how V-2 hit Belfast, Portsmouth, Liverpool. And they see cruise missiles hit Mykolaiv, Kramatorsk, Chernihiv. They remember how Birmingham was bombed. And they see its sister city Zaporizhzhia being damaged. The Dutch remember this. How Rotterdam became the first city to be completely destroyed when the Nazis dropped 97 tons of bombs on it. The French remember this. Remember Oradour-sur-Glane, where the SS burned half a thousand women and children alive. Mass hangings in Tulle, the massacre in the village of Ascq. Thousands of people at a resistance rally in occupied Lille. They saw what was done in Bucha, Irpin, Borodyanka, Volnovakha and Trostyanets. They see the occupation of Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk and other cities where people do not give up. And thousands of them go to peaceful rallies, which are beyond the power of the occupiers, and all they can do is shoot at civilians. The Czechs have not forgotten this. How in less than a day, the Nazis destroyed Lidice, leaving only ashes from the village. They saw Popasna destroyed. There are not even ashes left from it. The Greeks, who survived massacres and executions throughout the territory, the blockade and the Great Famine, have not forgotten. This is remembered by Americans who fought evil on two fronts. Who passed Pearl Harbor and Dunkirk with the Allies. And together we are going through new, no less difficult battles. This is remembered by all Holocaust survivors - how one nation can hate another. Lithuanians, Latvians, Estonians, Danes, Georgians, Armenians, Belgians, Norwegians and many others have not forgotten this - all those who suffered from Nazism on their land and all those who defeated it in the anti-Hitler coalition. Unfortunately, there are those who, having survived all these crimes, having lost millions of people who fought for victory and gained it, have desecrated the memory of them and their feat today. The one who allowed the shelling of the cities of Ukraine from his land. The cities that, along with our ancestors, were liberated by his ancestors. The one who spat in the face of his “Immortal Regiment”, placing torturers from Bucha next to it. And challenged all mankind. But forgot the main thing: any evil always ends the same – it ends. Fellow Ukrainians! Today, on the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, we pay homage to all those who defended their homeland and the world from Nazism. We note the feat of the Ukrainian people and their contribution to the victory of the anti-Hitler coalition. Explosions, shots, trenches, wounds, famine, bombing, blockades, mass executions, punitive operations, occupation, concentration camps, gas chambers, yellow stars, ghettos, Babyn Yar, Khatyn, captivity, forced labor. They died so that each of us knows what these words mean from books, not from our own experience. But it happened differently. This is unfair to them all. But the truth will win. And we will overcome everything! And the proof of this is called “Werewolf”. This is Hitler’s former headquarters and bunker near Vinnytsia. And all that is left of it is a few stones. Ruins. The ruins of a person who considered himself great and invincible. This is a guide for all of us and future generations. What our ancestors fought for. And proved that no evil can avoid responsibility. Will not be able to hide in the bunker. There will be no stone left of it. So we will overcome everything. And we know this for sure, because our military and all our people are descendants of those who overcame Nazism. So they will win again. And there will be peace again. Finally again! We will overcome the winter, which began on February 24, lasts on May 8, but will definitely end, and the Ukrainian sun will melt it! And we will meet our dawn together with the whole country. And family and loved ones, friends and relatives will be together again! Finally again! And over the temporarily occupied cities and villages our flag will fly again. Finally again! And we will get together. And there will be peace! Finally again! And no more black and white dreams, only a blue and yellow dream. Finally again! Our ancestors fought for this. Eternal honor to all who fought against Nazism! Eternal memory to all those killed during World War II! The Ukranian prosecutor general’s office has stated that the war with Russia has killed 225 children and injured 413. The prosecutor general’s Office said the figures are expected to be higher since they do not include child casualties in the areas where hostilities are ongoing and in the occupied areas. Ukraine’s ministry of foreign affairs has strongly condemned Russian shelling of a school in Bilohorivka, which is thought to have been sheltering 60 people. In a post on Twitter the ministry said: “#Russia committed this brutal war crime shortly before the Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation, constantly repeating the tragedy of World War II. #StopRussianWar” President Zelenskiy has compared Putin’s invasion of Ukraine to the actions of the Nazis in the second world war, as Ukraine marks its 8 May Day of Remembrance and Reconciliation. Christopher Miller, world and national security reporter for Politico, who is covering Russia’s war in Ukraine, has posted this video released by the president. In it he asks, “never again? Try telling Ukraine that” and draws comparisons between Ukraine battle against Russia to the second world war fight against fascism. Zelenskiy says that on 24 February, when Russia invaded his country, “the word never was erased”. Air raid sirens can be heard in the background. I will now be handing the blog over to my excellent colleague Alexandra Topping in London. Thanks for following along. At least two people have been killed and 60 more are feared dead after Russian bombs hit a school in the Ukrainian village of Bilohorivka, Serhiy Gaidai, governor of the Luhansk region, said on Sunday. Gaidai said Russia dropped a bomb on Saturday afternoon on the school where about 90 people were sheltering, causing a fire that engulfed the building. Thirty people have been rescued. “The fire was extinguished after nearly four hours, then the rubble was cleared, and, unfortunately, the bodies of two people were found,” Gaidai wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Sixty people were likely to have died under the rubble of buildings.” Separately, Gaidai said that according to preliminary information, shelling in the village of Shypilovo destroyed a house and 11 people remained under the building’s debris. On the brink of its May 9 Victory Day celebrations, Russia looks very far from triumph in its war in Ukraine. And all of its options going forward are fraught with danger. After a disastrous assault on Kyiv, Russia is engaged in an attempt to take territory in Ukraine’s east, as its military nears exhaustion and sanctions continue to escalate. “With the current force that they have, the push that they’re attempting now is all that they have left,” said Jeffrey Edmonds, former director for Russia on the US national security council and senior analyst at the CNA thinktank. “Militaries just don’t recover that quickly from such a devastating loss. And given how effective the Ukrainians have been with our support, I just don’t think they’re going to be able to achieve their objectives within the coming weeks. And the coming weeks are going to be the telltale of where this is going.” Facing setbacks, officials have suggested that Vladimir Putin may use the May 9 holiday to repackage the war in Ukraine. Dramatic options include escalation through a formal declaration of war or general mobilisation – or de-escalating by proclaiming victory. Alternatively, Putin could offer up a “sandwich”, as one analyst put it, that praises the Russian army’s “victory” while preparing the population for a grinding and painful conflict as status quo. As international efforts to pressure the Russian leader continue, G7 leaders, including US President Joe Biden and Ukraine’s Zelenskiy, are set to discuss Western support for Kyiv via videoconference today. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will host the call and Zelenskiy will “take part and report on the current situation,” government spokeswoman Christiane Hoffmann said. Further sanctions or at least a tightening of the huge array of economic punishments already inflicted on Russia are expected to be discussed. Ambassadors from EU member states will also meet in Brussels today to discuss their sixth round of economic sanctions against Moscow, which this time should include a phased ban on imports of Russian oil. Military authorities in Kyiv have claimed one of their drones sunk another Russian ship in the Black Sea as part of their offensive on Snake Island. The Ukrainian claim to have destroyed the ship – after the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva in the Black Sea last month – was accompanied by footage showing what was said to have been a strike by a Bayraktar drone on a vessel docked at Snake Island. “The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on 9 May this year will be held near Snake Island – at the bottom of the sea,” tweeted Ukraine’s Ministry of Defence. Snake Island, located some 35 km (20 miles) off the coast, figured in a memorable incident early in the war when Ukrainian border guards stationed there defied Russian orders to surrender, purportedly using colourful language. In a sign of the unexpectedly effective defense that has sustained the fighting into its 11th week, Ukraine’s military flattened Russian positions on a Black Sea island that was captured in the war’s first days and has become a symbol of resistance. Satellite photos analyzed by The Associated Press showed Ukraine targeting Russian-held Snake Island in a bid to impede Russia’s efforts to control the Black Sea. An image taken early Saturday by Planet Labs PBC showed that most of the island’s buildings had been destroyed by Ukrainian drone attacks, as well as what appeared to be a Serna-class landing craft against the island’s northern beach. Western military analysts also said a Ukrainian counteroffensive was advancing around the country’s second-largest city, Kharkiv, even as it remained a key target of Russian shelling. The most intense fighting in recent days has been in eastern Ukraine, where the two sides are entrenched in a fierce battle to capture or reclaim territory. Moscow’s offensive there has focused on the Donbas, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting since 2014. The governor of the Luhansk region, one of two that make up the Donbas, said a Russian strike destroyed a school in the village of Bilogorivka where 90 people were seeking safety in the basement. Gov. Serhiy Haidai, who posted pictures of the burning rubble on Telegram, said 30 people were rescued. The emergency services later reported that two bodies had been found and more could still be buried under the rubble. Rescue work was suspended overnight but was to resume on Sunday. Haidai also said two boys aged 11 and 14 were killed by Russian shelling in the town of Pryvillia, while two girls aged 8 and 12 and a 69-year-old woman were wounded. Moscow also has sought to sweep across southern Ukraine both to cut off the country from the sea and create a corridor to the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, long home to Russian troops. But it has struggled to achieve those objectives. On Saturday, six Russian cruise missiles fired from aircraft hit Odesa, where a curfew is in place until Tuesday morning. Videos posted on social media showed thick black smoke rising over the Black Sea port city as sirens wailed. The Odesa city council said four of the missiles hit a furniture company, with the shock waves and debris badly damaging high-rise apartment buildings. The other two missiles hit the Odesa airport, where the runway had already been taken out in a previous Russian attack. Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Russia’s republic of Chechnya, said on Sunday his soldiers have taken control of most of the eastern Ukrainian city of Popasna, while Ukrainian officials said a battle for the town in the east of the country is ongoing. In mid-April, Russian forces launched a new offensive push along most of Ukraine’s eastern flank, with some of most intense attacks and shelling taking place recently around Popasna in the Luhansk region. “Fighters of the Chechen special forces ... have taken most of Popasna under control,” Kadyrov, who has often described himself as Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “foot soldier”, wrote in a post on the Telegram messaging app. “The main streets and central districts of the town have been completely cleared.” Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. There was no immediate response from Ukraine, but late Saturday Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said heavy fighting for the town continues. “A battle for Popasna is ongoing,” Arestovych said in a video on social media. “Russian propagandists have joyfully reported that they have already taken it, but this is not quite how it is. This is their 117th ‘capture of Popasna’ claim only this week.” Anguish for partners of Mariupol’s defenders as Russian assault goes on “Holding up”, wrote Denys Prokopenko, commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, in his latest WhatsApp message to his wife Kateryna from the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Speaking via Zoom from Krakow, in eastern Poland, alongside three fellow wives and partners of soldiers living under the remorseless Russian shelling and infiltrating raids, Kateryna,27, says she is doing everything she can think of to ensure the message at 10pm on Friday evening is not one of her husband’s last. It is now two weeks since the last Ukrainian defenders of the flattened city of Mariupol, in south-east Ukraine, withdrew to the sprawling complex of hot and fetid tunnels, along with thousands of terrified civilians, including children. For the 2,000 soldiers, 700 of whom are said to be injured, hope, however, is quickly dwindling, as has become cruelly clear from the irregular messages coming out of the works. “The last message was yesterday,” Kateryna says of the text from her 30-year-old husband. I said ‘Hold up, we will do everything in our power to save you.’” The Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy condemned Russia’s targeting of Ukrainian cultural monuments and institutions, saying that “nearly 200 cultural heritage sites already” had been damaged or destroyed. His comments, made in his nightly address on Telegram on Saturday, followed the destruction of a museum dedicated to the 18th century philosopher and poet Hryhoriy Skovoroda after it was hit by Russian shelling. “Targeted missile strikes at museums — this is not even every terrorist can think of,” said Zelenskiy. “Every day of this war, the Russian army does something that is beyond words. But every next day it does something that makes you feel it in a new way.” Fighters battle to hold in Mariupol With supplies running low, amputations conducted in a ramshackle clinic, and corpses piling up, the fighters trapped at the besieged steel plant in Ukraine’s Mariupol are battling to hold on as Russian forces tighten their grip on the city’s last redoubt. A smattering of Ukrainian units making their last stand are sheltering in the labyrinth of Soviet-era bunkers and tunnels snaking beneath the sprawling steelworks along with an untold number of wounded and dead combatants. Details about the chaotic final defence and desperate efforts to tend to the wounded have been painstakingly pieced together by military medic Yevgenia Tytarenko, whose husband and colleagues remain trapped inside the factory. “Lots of soldiers are in serious condition in the hospital. They are injured with no medicine. Food and water are running out,” said Tytarenko, who remains in regular contact with people inside the Azovstal plant. “I’ll be standing until the end,” Tytarenko’s husband and medic Mykhailo texted to her on Friday, in a message shared with AFP. For weeks, Russian forces have pounded the steelworks by land, air, and sea - while attempting to breach its defenses that have led to fierce firefights at the facility. Commanders have issued their final goodbyes to loved ones as supplies dwindle and the Russians close in, while the possibility of extracting the fighters looks increasingly unlikely, said Tytarenko. “Commanders have already said their farewells to their wives. One of them messaged his wife: ‘Don’t cry. We’ll be back home in any case - alive or dead’,” said Tytarenko. Tytarenko described a chaotic and complex operation inside Azovstal with fighters battling the Russians while also shepherding civilians along with the bodies of those killed to different parts of the plant. Without refrigeration, the bodies of the dead have been packed in plastic bags and are rotting, but the fighters remain committed to preventing them from falling into the hands of the Russian forces. “Almost everywhere, they are carrying corpses with them,” said Tytarenko. “They deserve to be evacuated - those who are alive, injured, and dead.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that over 300 civilians had been rescued from Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where they had been trapped for 72 days. Speaking in his nightly Telegram address, he said:“I am grateful to the teams of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations Organisation, who helped us organise the first phase of the evacuation missions from Azovstal,” Zelenskiy said in a video posted to Telegram. However, while the Ukrainian government said that “all women, children and the elderly” had been evacuated , there were still doctors and soldiers, including many wounded, stuck in the bunkers of the Mariupol steel plant, which is still undergoing vicious shelling and attacks by Russian forces. Ukraine on Saturday urged aid agency Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to evacuate its soldiers from their last holdout in Mariupol. Ukraine “calls on MSF to organise a mission to evacuate the defenders of Mariupol and Azovstal and provide medical care to the wounded people, whose human rights were violated by Russian Federation,” the ministry of reintegration of temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine wrote in a statement in English. They have been “for 72 days in a row under... ongoing shelling and attacks by the Russian army”, it added. “Now, there is a lack of medicines, water and food, wounded soldiers are dying because of gangrene and sepsis.” Good morning and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here are the latest developments: Russian forces fired six cruise missiles at the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa on Saturday and continued to bombarded a besieged steel mill in Mariupol. Russia appears to want to complete their conquest of Mariupol in time for Victory Day celebrations on 9 May. The Ukrainian government has said that it has destroyed another Russian ship. The ministry of defence claimed that Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 had hit the landing craft of the Serna project, tweeting: “The traditional parade of the Russian Black Sea fleet on May 9 this year will be held near Snake Island – at the bottom of the sea.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said more than 300 civilians have been rescued from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where they had been stuck for 72 days during a bitter battle for the city. Zelenskiy said they were now preparing for a “second stage of evacuation” to rescue doctors and soldiers still trapped there. The Ukrainian government have urged Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to help with the evacuation Zelenskiy also expressed regret at the cultural devastation caused by the war. In his nightly address on Telegram, he said “nearly 200 cultural heritage sites” in Ukraine had been lost or damaged A Russian bomb hit a school in the eastern Ukraine village of Bilogorivka where 90 people were sheltering, according to the governor of Luhansk. He said several bodies had been pulled from the rubble. CIA Director William Burns said the war is in a dangerous phase because President Putin “thinks he cannot afford to lose” . Burns said the huge amount of western military support for Ukraine was not a deterrent to the Russian President Britain has pledged to provide another £1.3bn ($1.60bn) in military support and aid to Ukraine. The new funds will almost double Britain’s previous spending commitments to Ukraine. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement, “Putin’s brutal attack is not only causing untold devastation in Ukraine – it is also threatening peace and security across Europe.” The Group of Seven (G7) leaders will hold a video call on Sunday with Zelenskiy in a show of unity the day before Russia marks its Victory Day holiday, the White House said. Talks will focus on the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, efforts to bolster the country and ways to demonstrate “continued G7 unity in our collective response, including by imposing severe costs for Putin’s war”," a spokesperson for the White House said.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘No humanity whatsoever’: pleas for UK to grant visa to autistic Ukrainian boy,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/26/autistic-ukrainian-boy-timothy-tymoshenko-uk-grant-visa,2022-05-26T16:05:10Z,Timothy Tymoshenko was sent to Poland because of his distress but does not qualify for Homes for Ukraine scheme,"A British man who has turned his Polish castle into a makeshift hotel for Ukrainian refugees has accused the UK government of showing “no humanity whatsoever” for not allowing a severely autistic teenager to come to live with an approved foster carer in Lancashire. Pleas are mounting for compassion to be shown to Timothy Tymoshenko, 16, who fled the war in Ukraine without his parents. He is living with his 17-year-old brother, Yurii, in what was once a private palace for the prince-bishop of Wrocław in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border. Jim Parton, a former stockbroker and writer from London, lives there with his Polish wife, Anna, and their six children, aged seven to 17. When the Russian invasion began in February, they decided to turn what is usually a guest house and wedding venue into an open house for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary abroad. They are currently hosting 17 people in the sprawling 700-year-old palace, after four left for Canada on Monday. Among those remaining is Timothy, who is severely autistic, non-verbal and needs strong prescription medication to control his changing moods. Experienced children’s carers in Lancashire have been to visit the boys in Poland and are willing to take brothers in, but are growing increasingly frustrated that the UK government hasn’t yet granted them visas to enter the country. Julie Elliot, 61, and her husband, Roger, 66, already have 14 children together – four biological and 10 adopted. Both worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers to their adopted family, and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children. Their adopted children, aged between nine and 40, all have disabilities and eight of them still live at the couple’s home in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire. They and Parton are pleading with the Home Office to let Timothy come to the UK along with his brother. They do not qualify for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as unaccompanied children under 18. The issue is the subject of a high court challenge and dozens of UK foster carers are anxiously waiting to see if approval is granted for the children they hope to care for to be brought to the UK. Parton is growing increasingly frustrated with the visa situation. “It’s an absolute disgrace that it is taking so long. There’s no humanity whatsoever from the government in recognising that this is a special case,” he said. “What makes me most cross is the safeguarding reason for delaying visas for these children,” said Julie Elliot, who recently travelled to Poland to meet Timothy and Yurii and help look after Timothy for a week. On arrival, she found him to be hungry, unwashed and dehydrated. “Tim needs someone to care for him to ensure he eats and drinks regularly,” she said. The boys’ mother, Anna, sent the two brothers across the border because Timothy was not coping with the interruption to his routine by having to hurry into underground bomb shelters and was getting very distressed at the sound of the constant warning sirens. “Tim is in a very unsafe situation,” said Elliot. “We have been through 10 adoption assessments and they are the most frightening thing on God’s earth but they don’t compare with this process of trying to get a visa for Tim. There doesn’t seem to be a system in place. I was told we should hear something about the legal case in 14 days but that is a long time when you’re a child and nobody’s looking after you … All I’m asking for these children like Tim who are waiting to be fostered is just give them a visa, they’re not going to be any trouble to anyone.” Anna is also frustrated about the delays in granting the visas: “When the generous people of Britain extended a helping hand to my family we cannot grab it because the documents will not be issued. As a mother I am under a lot of stress and want to breathe a sigh of relief that my children are not under shelling and are under supervision of responsible and kind people,” she said. A government spokesperson said: “It is tragic that children have been caught up in Putin’s war. The safety and wellbeing of children is paramount and it is vital we have robust safeguarding processes. For this reason, only under-18s who are reuniting with a parent or legal guardian in the UK are currently eligible for Homes for Ukraine. We keep eligibility for all schemes under review.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What’s next for Ukraine after Russia’s Donbas offensive?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/whats-next-for-ukraine-after-russias-donbas-offensive,2022-05-31T12:13:13Z,Analysis: Indiscriminate tactics of Russia’s grinding progress in east could characterise next phase of war,"The recent Russian advances in the Donbas lead to an inevitable question: whether the indiscriminate tactics the Kremlin deployed there will be a template for future offensives. With reports of large numbers of troops, artillery and rocket launchers mustering across the border near the Russian city of Kursk – in an area that borders Ukraine’s Sumy province – it is an urgent issue. While much has been made of the painfully slow and grinding pace of Russia’s recent offensive in the Donbas, the speed of territorial gains is not the only metric. The Russian tactics that have shaped the battle in the Donbas have also posed a brutal dilemma for Ukraine’s defenders – to hold their ground amid rapidly mounting casualties, or withdraw and risk giving the attackers momentum. While other parts of the 300-mile frontline in Ukraine’s east lack some of the same vulnerabilities that existed around Sievierodonetsk – which sat in the midst of a Ukrainian salient that Russia exploited – in any future offensive the Kremlin is likely to offer Kyiv the same hard choices, attempting to stretch its ability to respond. Perhaps the first and most pressing issue – if and when Russian forces fully take Sievierodonetsk – is whether they then attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River, after disastrous attempts at crossing elsewhere were targeted by Ukrainian artillery with deadly effect. Whether or not Russian forces attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets River – a natural barrier – at Sievierodonetsk or elsewhere within Ukraine, Russian forces appear to be preparing for a fresh push farther north amid evidence that they are regrouping near the Ukrainian town of Izium to renew their stalled efforts against Slovyansk, rebuilding a railway bridge near Kupyansk to facilitate the movement of troops and equipment to the area. What is more difficult to assess is the level of attrition inflicted on both sides, and what impact that will have on further offensives and Ukraine’s ability to defend and counterattack. While the UK’s Ministry of Defence has made much of Russian losses throughout the war – most recently the mounting casualties among junior officers – Russian gains in the Donbas appear to tell a different story, for now at least. Increasing anecdotal evidence suggests that Ukraine has suffered heavy casualties during recent fighting in the east, largely from shrapnel, and there are reports of equipment and supply issues. What may well be true is that despite evidence of fresh Russian preparations, the difficulty of the fighting and heavy losses may limit Russia’s ambitions beyond controlling the Donbas, the south and its key coastline. “After almost a hundred days of war,” Michael Clarke of the Royal United Services Institute wrote in the Times earlier this week, “the Russian offensive in Ukraine is finally beginning to look more coherent, if not yet strategically wise or sustainable.” Predicting a prolonged war, however, the former Australian general Mick Ryan disputed the notion that either Russia or Ukraine was close to exhaustion in a lengthy Twitter thread examining the current military position and likely trajectory. “In April and early May, after Ukraine’s victory in the battle of Kyiv, a degree of triumphalism crept into Ukraine war narratives. But as the Russians have shown recently, by concentrating their forces on smaller regions of Ukraine, they can generate tactical victories,” he said. “Neither belligerent has demonstrated the capacity to land a strategically decisive blow against the other. Despite the Ukrainians demonstrating superiority in global influence, strategy and leadership, the Russians keep generating the combat power to attack them in the east. “Despite the Russians and Ukrainians losing people and equipment in the hundreds (if not thousands), neither are exhausted nations. The Russians have reserves of manpower and equipment in storage. Ukraine has masses of military aid flowing across its borders.” In spite of continuing Russian shelling around Kharkiv and in the south around Kherson, where two limited Ukrainian counteroffensives have stalled, the Russian objective in both those areas – according to the Ukrainian general staff – is to consolidate defences and supply lines and to disrupt Ukrainian forces where they have managed to advance. Elsewhere, however, as the US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War suggests: “Russian advances remain limited and are unlikely to increase in pace in the near term, particularly as Russian forces continue to prioritise assaults on Sievierodonetsk at the cost of other lines of effort.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine counterattack recaptures parts of Sievierodonetsk in Donbas ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/ukraine-counterattack-recaptures-parts-of-sievierodonetsk-in-donbas,2022-06-04T18:07:56Z,"Russians ‘suffering huge losses’, region’s governor claims, amid heavy fighting","Ukraine has staged a counterattack on the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and recaptured a fifth of the city it had previously lost to the Russian invaders, according to the head of the region. Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, said Russian forces were giving up recent gains in the city, as reports also emerged of foreign fighters joining the battle for the easternmost city held by Kyiv in the fiercely contested Donbas. The governor told Ukrainian television that Russia had “previously managed to capture most of the city” – but added in a tweet that the military had pushed them back by 20%. “They are really suffering huge losses,” he said. The claims are hard to verify amid the heavy fighting. The Russians have concentrated their forces on trying to surround and capture the city in the past two weeks, advancing at a rate of 500 metres to a kilometre a day. Ukrainians fighting on the eastern frontline estimated that their forces controlled “around 30%” of Sievierodonetsk on Saturday, greater than some rough estimates from late last week. They said Russian forces were running out of infantry troops and were unable to push forward. Slava Vladimirovich, a Ukrainian soldier with the Donbas battalion, said the Russian army was pounding the neighbouring city of Lysychansk. Two civilians died in a Russian artillery attack, he said. Thousands of civilians were still in the city, but many seemed reluctant to leave. “We were supposed to evacuate ten people. Only three turned up. Poor people are afraid of losing what little they have. There is no water in the city and long queues of civilians waiting at distribution points.” Foreign fighters from countries including Australia, Georgia, France and Brazil were also being deployed by Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk, according to a video report circulating widely. It features an interview with a masked soldier, who said he was from Australia, saying he had “stepped up” to join the fighting. A second soldier, speaking English with an American accent, said he was “a 22-year-old kid” from Georgia and promised to help push Russians back. “We’re on the right side of the history,” he added. But the risks to foreign fighters in a brutal and deadly conflict remain considerable. Ukraine’s International Legion acknowledged on Saturday that four people from the Netherlands, Australia, Germany and France had been killed. It named them as Ronald Vogelaar, Michael O’Neill, Björn Benjamin Clavis and Wilfried Blériot. Vogelaar, 55, was previously reported by Dutch media to have been killed by artillery fire near Kharkiv last month; while O’Neill, 47, was said to be a humanitarian worker when it was reported he had been killed in late May. Blériot, 32, meanwhile, had appeared in a film early in March, where he told the Argentinian publication Clarin that he was “ready to die” as he headed out from Poland. He said he had spent “a year in the French army” and cried when he talked about his two young children. Russia wants to capture Sievierodonetsk, which had a population of 100,000 before the war, and Lysychansk, which is across the river, to complete the capture of the Luhansk oblast, one of the two Donbas regions claimed by Russia. From there they hope to capture the Ukrainian cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk in the neighbouring Donetsk oblast. Loud explosions could be heard from the centre of Slavyansk on Saturday, from Russian artillery in the distance and from answering Ukrainian fire. The city’s air raid siren went off repeatedly. Some people were out and about on the streets of Slavyansk buying food. The city is without gas and water and has intermittent electricity. Many residents have left, but some have remained behind and another group has returned to frontline Donbas towns after fleeing and then running out of money. A wooden Russian Orthodox church, close to the Sviatohirsk monastery, around 12 miles north of Slavyansk, was pictured burning as a result of the fighting. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said four people were killed and four wounded following a Russian attack. Three hundred people, including 60 children, were said by Zelenskiy to be sheltering in the monastery complex. British defence intelligence said that Russia had been able combine “airstrikes and massed artillery fire to bring its overwhelming firepower to bear” and so support “its creeping advance”. But the British said it had come at a cost. The use of “unguided munitions has led to the widespread destruction of built-up areas in the Donbas”. Film released by Haidai, the Luhansk governor, early on Saturday showed apartment blocks damaged and on fire, while shelling was audible near by. Haidai acknowledged that the situation for the Ukrainians in Sievierodonetsk remained difficult, but said he believed the defenders could now hold out for another fortnight. A Russian victory in that timescale was “not realistic”, he added. After that, the governor said, he hoped that newly promised western Himars – multiple-launch rocket systems – could tip the balance in Kyiv’s favour, by allowing Ukraine to target the Russians at a greater distance than before. “As soon as we have enough western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,” the governor added. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Friday that he had been told by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Russia would now “accelerate” the invasion. New tactics that “will make it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of offensive manoeuvres” had been identified, Kadyrov added. But in an overnight assessment, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank closely following the conflict, said it was sceptical about the claims made.

"Ukraine fighting back in Sievierodonetsk, according to Luhansk governor",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/ukraine-fighting-back-in-sievierodonetsk-claims-luhansk-governor,2022-06-04T12:51:42Z,Serhiy Haidai says counterattack has recaptured a fifth of frontline city from Russian invaders,"Ukraine has staged a counterattack on the frontline city of Sievierodonetsk and recaptured a fifth of the city it had previously lost to Russian invaders, according to the head of the region. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk oblast, told Ukrainian television that Russian forces were forfeiting recent gains in the city, the easternmost held by Kyiv in the Donbas region, where fighting has been concentrated. The governor said Russia had “previously managed to capture most of the city” – but added in a tweet that the military had pushed them back by 20%. “They are really suffering huge losses,” he said. Such claims are hard to verify amid the heavy fighting, which had seen the Russian invaders concentrate their forces on trying to surround and capture the city in the past two weeks, advancing at a rate of 500m to 1km a day. British defence intelligence said on Saturday that Russia had been able combine “airstrikes and massed artillery fires to bring its overwhelming firepower to bear” and so support “its creeping advance”. But the British said it had come at a cost. The use of “unguided munitions has led to the widespread destruction of built-up areas in the Donbas”. Film released by Haidai early on Saturday showed apartment blocks damaged and on fire, while shelling was heard nearby. Haidai acknowledged that the situation for the Ukrainians in Sievierodonetsk remained difficult, but said he believed the defenders could now hold out for another fortnight. A Russian victory in that timescale was “not realistic”, he added. After that, the governor said, he hoped that newly promised western Himars multiple launch rocket systems could tip the balance in Kyiv’s favour, by allowing Ukraine to target them at a greater distance that before. “But as soon as we have enough western long-range weapons, we will push their artillery away from our positions. And then, believe me, the Russian infantry, they will just run,” the governor added. Foreign fighters from countries such as Australia, Georgia, France and Brazil were also being deployed by Ukraine in Sievierodonetsk, according to a video report released on Friday. It features an interview with a masked soldier speaking clearly with an Australian accent, saying he had “stepped up” to join the fighting. The Chechen leader, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Friday he had been told by Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, that Russia would now “accelerate” the invasion. New tactics that “will make it possible to significantly increase the effectiveness of offensive manoeuvres” had been identified, Kadyrov added. But in an overnight assessment, the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank closely following the conflict, said it was sceptical about the claims made. On speeding the rate of advance, the institute said it believed “Russian forces are unlikely to be able to do so”. In Ukraine’s southern Odesa region on Saturday morning, a missile hit an agricultural storage unit, wounding two people, the regional administration’s spokesperson wrote on Telegram. Ukraine said it had also shot down four other cruise missiles launched from a submarine in the Black Sea – while Russia’s defence ministry said its forces shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane near Odesa. Two people died and at least two were injured in Russian shelling of civilian infrastructure in the north-eastern Kharkiv region on Friday, Ukraine’s Interfax reported, citing emergency services. Russian authorities began issuing passports in Kherson and Melitopol on Friday, according to the Institute for the Study of War, while Ukraine’s military said the occupiers faced growing resistance in the southern region, which had forced Moscow to reinforce its troops there.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EU debates watering down Russian oil ban in face of Hungarian opposition,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/eu-debate-ban-oil-imports-russia-hungary-orban-ukraine-war,2022-05-29T17:52:16Z,"A deal to placate Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, could allow pipeline imports via Ukraine","The EU is debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Senior EU diplomats holding a special meeting on Sunday were deadlocked over a compromise plan that would see the bloc ban Russian oil arriving in tankers but allow pipeline imports, a proposal that would allow Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine. More than three weeks after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil imports by the end of the year, the EU is stalled on the plans. Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil, has said it needs five years and billions of euros to upgrade its refineries. The row threatens to overshadow a summit of EU leaders in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday, formally dedicated to discussing economic, political and humanitarian support for Ukraine and the crisis in global food supplies. EU ambassadors will meet on Monday morning in a fresh attempt to find a compromise on the oil embargo. “It might not work, it might work, but I think we have a duty to try it,” a senior EU official said. Excluding pipelines from EU sanctions would protect one-third of Russian oil that comes to the bloc, preserving a valuable source of revenue for Moscow. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who is due to address EU leaders via video link on Monday, criticised the bloc last week for its failure to come to an agreement on the oil embargo. “Look at the number of weeks the European Union has been trying to agree on a sixth package of sanctions against Russia,” he said on Thursday, noting that the EU was paying Russia nearly €1bn (£850m) a day for energy. “Where did those who block the sixth package get so much power?” When the idea of excluding pipeline oil was floated weeks ago, several member states shot it down on the grounds that it gave an unfair advantage to countries that can continue getting cheap Russian crude. Internal estimates suggest Hungary could benefit from oil 35% cheaper than neighbouring countries. After weeks of stalemate, however, a growing number of countries are looking for ways to break the deadlock. “To have no agreement or drag things further would be the worst, but to see blackmailing consequences is also disappointing,” a senior EU diplomat said. The issue has deepened the wedge between Hungary and its traditional central European allies. A senior Polish diplomat said they could not understand the logic of Budapest’s policy on Ukraine and described opposition to the oil embargo as political rather than technical. “They have received everything that is technically reasonable,” they said. Hungary has been offered a two-year delay in introducing the oil embargo to allow time to retool refineries and establish new oil routes from its southern neighbour Croatia. Some advise against rushing into a hasty deal as the proposed oil embargo was not envisaged to come completely into force until the end of the year. Others feel the delay sends a terrible political signal as Russian forces appear to be gaining the upper hand in Donbas through relentless artillery fire and airstrikes. Hungary further angered some EU states when it said the question should not even be discussed at the summit on Monday. “It would only highlight our internal divisions without offering a realistic chance to resolve differences,” Orbán wrote last week to the European Council president, Charles Michel, who is organising the meeting. Budapest is angling for EU funds to upgrade its refineries, which can currently only take Russian oil. Orbán complained that there were not enough specifics on EU funds for landlocked central European states in a recent European Commission plan outlining how the EU can move away from Russian fossil fuels. In that plan, known as RePowerEU, the commission made a controversial proposal to allow member states to sell surplus carbon credits that could make it cheaper to burn fossil fuels. It also suggested a voluntary transfer of funds from other parts of the EU budget. But some of the decarbonisation funds would be placed in a recovery plan, which is unavailable to Hungary because of longstanding concerns about the rule of law in the country. The country has been denied €7.2bn in funds from the EU’s Covid recovery fund because it has failed to satisfy EU officials that it can ensure the money is spent properly. Hungary is seen as being in a vulnerable position as the Druzhba – which translates as “friendship” – pipeline runs through Ukraine. A senior Ukrainian official described the part of the pipeline running to Hungary as “great leverage” last week. Olena Zerkal, an adviser to Ukraine’s energy minister, said it would be “very appropriate if something happened to this pipeline”, according to comments reported by the Ukrainian news agency Ukrinform. Hungary’s opposition means other measures in the EU sanctions package have not come into force, including tightening restrictions on Russian banks and imposing asset freezes and travel bans on dozens of high-ranking Russians, including a former gymnast rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend and the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine renews diplomatic push for speedy EU membership,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/ukraine-renews-diplomatic-push-for-speedy-eu-membership,2022-06-03T05:15:06Z,"Effort to win over doubters in Berlin, Paris and other capitals and start accession process","Ukrainian officials are embarking on a concerted diplomatic push to start the country’s journey towards EU membership, as scepticism remains in a number of western European capitals about a fast-track approach. Since Russia’s invasion, many in Europe, including Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, have spoken in favour of putting Ukraine on a speedy path to EU accession by granting it candidate status. However there are still doubts in Berlin, Paris and other capitals over whether it is possible to begin the formal process already, before a leaders’ summit later this month that is expected to decide on the issue. “It will be very hard to say no, but it will be even harder to say yes,” said one European diplomat briefed on the discussions. Ultimately, the decision is likely to come down to personal discussion between European leaders at the summit, with the positions of France’s Emmanuel Macron and Germany’s Olaf Scholz seen as crucial. Some people have floated alternatives, such as giving Ukraine a commitment to candidate status later, or admitting it to a broader and looser framework of countries without granting full membership. Olha Stefanishyna, Ukraine’s deputy prime minister with responsibility for European integration, said either of these outcomes would be extremely disappointing. “If European leaders keep going in the same way they were before 24 February, in terms of speed, ambiguity and a lack of willingness to irritate Putin, this would be a major failure of Europe as a project,” she said, in a telephone interview from Paris, which she was visiting as part of a European tour to shore up support for candidate status. “Ukraine wants a legal commitment and not a political promise,” she added, citing the 1994 Budapest memorandum – under which Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons – and the 2008 promise of future membership in Nato as pledges the west had not fulfilled, which had made Ukraine weaker politically. “There have been three wars since 2008, so we call on leaders to refrain from more political promises, and instead to start the legal decisions which would pave the way for a European track for Ukraine and ensure we are members of the European family,” she said. A month ago, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Ukraine should be granted candidate status “right now, in the condition of war, within the framework of a special shortened procedure for obtaining EU membership”. He was backed by von der Leyen, who in April had visited Kyiv and handed Zelenskiy a questionnaire that forms the first stage of the EU candidacy process. Von der Leyen had told the Ukrainian president: “Dear Volodymyr, my message today is clear: Ukraine belongs in the European family. We have heard your request, loud and clear. And today, we are here to give you a first, positive answer.” Candidate status is just the first step in a long process of obtaining full membership, but even that decision is under question, with France, Germany the Netherlands and the Nordic nations among sceptics. Macron has said it could take 20 years for Ukraine to become an EU member. One argument made in conversations with Ukrainian officials is that it would be unfair on some of the western Balkan nations, who have been “in the queue” for longer, to fast-track Ukraine’s application. Others cite issues around the rule of law with Hungary and Poland. One European diplomat said: “It’s clear already that EU decision-making is not working well, and we see Hungary holding the other 26 members hostage. We need to reform our internal processes first before we start talking about other members.” Alyona Getmanchuk, the founder and director of New Europe Center, a Kyiv-based thinktank, said she had heard another reason for scepticism, particularly in Germany, on a recent visit to lobby for candidate status. “We heard informally that there is a fear of provoking Putin. We heard that especially in Germany: that by granting Ukraine candidacy, it could provoke Putin more and there would be more escalation.” Recent polls suggest that support for EU membership among Ukrainians has soared to 91% since the start of the invasion, with a strong majority backing it even in the east and south of Ukraine, which traditionally has been more sceptical. Getmanchuk noted that for the first time, most people in European countries supported Ukrainian membership. “If this decision is not taken in June it could be more difficult to take it later, when there will be more disappointment in European societies as gas prices rise and so on,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Biden approves sending rockets to Ukraine | First Thing,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/01/first-thing-biden-approves-sending-rockets-to-ukraine,2022-06-01T09:58:35Z,"Moscow says US decision to supply rocket systems ‘increases risk’ of confrontation. Plus, Maverick sparks joy in Taiwan","Good morning. Joe Biden has confirmed he will send medium-range advanced rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The high-mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more, according to two senior administration officials. The weapons package will be formally disclosed on Wednesday. In a New York Times guest essay published on Tuesday, Biden said Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would end through diplomacy but that the US must provide significant weapons and ammunition to give Ukraine the highest leverage at the negotiating table. “That’s why I’ve decided that we will provide the Ukrainians with more advanced rocket systems and munitions that will enable them to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine,” Biden wrote. How has Russia reacted? Russia has said that the US decision is extremely negative and will increase the risk of a direct confrontation. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” said the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov. What are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine? The new weapon is the Himars multiple-launch rocket system, or MLRS: a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles. ‘Humble and charismatic’: Uvalde shooting victims mourned at first funerals Funerals for the victims of the Uvalde elementary school shooting began in the small Texas town on Tuesday. In the afternoon, hundreds of mourners turned out for the funeral mass for Amerie Jo Garza, a fourth-grader who was killed a week ago after an 18-year-old gunman who was eventually killed by law enforcement murdered 19 children and two teachers at Robb elementary school. Nineteen more funerals are planned over the next two-and-a-half weeks. On Monday and Tuesday, visitations were held for two victims. Amerie Jo Garza and Maite Rodriguez, whose funeral was on Tuesday evening, were both 10 years old. Visitations for one of the teachers, 48-year-old Irma Garcia, and for two more children, Nevaeh Bravo and Jose Flores Jr, were also held on Tuesday. At the afternoon funeral for Amerie, Sacred Heart Catholic church turned away several mourners after reaching capacity. Hundreds were inside. Six pallbearers wearing white shirts and gloves carried a small casket. What’s happening with the push for better gun laws? Texas leaders are under growing pressure to increase gun control measures in the face of data indicating the state leads the US in mass shooting deaths, while Republicans have steadily eased restrictions on weapons and cut mental health spending. Peter Navarro subpoena suggests DoJ may be investigating Trump Peter Navarro, a top White House adviser to Donald Trump, is being commanded by a federal grand jury subpoena to turn over to the justice department his communications with the former president, the former president’s attorneys and the former president’s representatives. The exact nature of the subpoena – served on 26 May 2022 and first obtained by the Guardian – and whether it means Trump himself is under criminal investigation for January 6 could not be established given the unusually sparse details included on the order. But certain elements appear to suggest that it is related to a new investigation examining potential criminality by the former president and, at the very least, that the justice department is expanding its inquiry for the first time into Trump and his inner circle. The subpoena compelled Navarro to either testify to a grand jury early next month, or produce to prosecutors all documents requested in a separate congressional subpoena issued earlier this year by the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol attack. What did the justice department say in the subpoena? “All documents relating to the subpoena dated 9 February 2022, that you received from the House select committee including but not limited to any communication with former President Trump and/or his counsel or representatives.” In other news … Hurricane Agatha caused flooding and mudslides that killed at least 10 people and left 20 missing, the governor of the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca said yesterday.

Climate check: we cannot adapt our way out of climate crisis, warns leading scientist The world cannot adapt its way out of the climate crisis, and counting on adaptation to limit damage is no substitute for urgently cutting greenhouse gases, a leading climate scientist has warned. Katharine Hayhoe, chief scientist for the Nature Conservancy in the US and a professor at Texas Tech University, said the world was heading for dangers unseen in the 10,000 years of human civilisation, and efforts to make the world more resilient were needed but by themselves could not soften the impact enough.

But the two flags remain in the cut being screened in Taiwan, with local news outlet Setn reporting that audiences at an advance screening cheered and applauded at the sight of the jacket.

Alleged Wagner Group fighters accused of murdering civilians in Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/wagner-group-fighters-accused-murdering-civilians-ukraine-war-crimes-belarus,2022-05-25T13:36:43Z,Belarusian pair are first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges since invasion began,"Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors late on Tuesday released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. They say five are Russian soldiers, one is a Russian mercenary with the Wagner Group and the final two are Belarusian mercenaries. The Guardian has previously reported on the alleged involvement of the soldiers named by prosecutors on Tuesday in the systematic torture and murder of civilians in Ukraine including the head of the village council and her husband and son. There have been reports of Wagner fighters on the ground in Ukraine, but these are the first charges against allegedly serving mercenaries, and the first non-Russians charged. Established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Wagner is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin and has faced western sanctions. Russia has used paid fighters to bolster its forces since the start of the war. It was estimated to have deployed between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere, including Wagner Group fighters, in its offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region, a European official said last month. A survivor had previously described to the Guardian how Russian soldiers who were perpetrating a sadistic killing spree lasting days in the village had described Ukraine as a “fairytale” compared with Syria. Prosecutors said Sergey Vladimirovich Sazanov 51, born in the town of Rechitsa in Belarus, was one of about 300 Wagner mercenaries who participated in a February 2018 offensive in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. They cited the open source research group InformNapalm. Another man, Alexander Alexandrovich Stupnitsky, 32, a native of Orsha in Belarus, was identified as a liaison officer for the assault platoon of the Wagner Group’s 1st reconnaissance and assault company. The third man identified as a Wagner member, Sergey Sergeevich Sazonov, 33, was born in Kaliningrad and is allegedly the driver of the Wagner Group command vehicle. Denis Korotkov, an expert on the Wagner Group, confirmed that two of the suspects had previously worked for the mercenary company. “Sazonov and Stupnitsky are in my files,” Korotkov told the Guardian. He said it was unusual for Belarusian citizens to fight with the group, because they could face jail sentences for it. “It is likely that Sazonov and Stupnitsky fought in Syria,” he added. “They don’t have a particular reputation, just regular Wagner soldiers.” None of the accused men are in custody, and prosecutors believe they may since have been relocated to frontline positions in the Donbas, where Putin has positioned most of his armed forces following their retreat from the area around Kyiv. “There is a possibility that these men are still fighting in Ukraine, or that they will be killed during the fighting,”said Oleh Tkalenko, a senior prosecutor in the Kyiv region. “We are still working on it and we will do everything possible to arrest them.” Tkalenko said the investigation was based on photographic evidence, CCTV footage and reports of hundreds of survivors who confirmed the identities of their torturers. Only three men survived the torture camp in Motyzhyn. After killing the civilians, the soldiers buried them in mass graves around the camp. In one, investigators found the corpse of Olga Petrivna, the head of the village council of Motyzhyn, together with her husband and son. Petrivna had chosen to stay in the town and coordinate aid and territorial defence when the Russians arrived. Tkalenko said that Ukrainian authorities had so far identified more than 5,000 Russian soldiers who were deployed north of Kyiv. “We are keeping records of all prisoners of war, and we know which ones committed war crimes.” The list of alleged war criminals includes 15 other Russian soldiers charged with human rights abuses during the brutal month-long occupation of towns north of Kyiv. Anna Neistat of the Clooney Foundation for Justice said Ukraine’s general prosecutor’s office had signalled that it wanted to lead the overall effort while showing a willingness to accept help from the international community. “They are very active. To date they’ve opened 11,000 cases,” said Neistat. “For the first time in decades, in a conflict situation, we have a national prosecutor who is able to lead these investigations and it’s absolutely right” that Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines. “Having said that, there is a danger of the prosecutors are getting overwhelmed because it’s huge number of cases,” said Neistat, who noted that instead of obstructing parallel investigations, the prosecutor’s office had been open to international support and was active in coordinating parallel investigations being launched elsewhere. There has been unprecedented interest in building cases by foreign prosecutors and NGOs over the crimes committed in Ukraine. More than a dozen national prosecutors outside of Ukraine have opened cases into war crimes or crimes of aggression. The international criminal court opened its investigation just four days after the invasion. On Monday, a court in Kyiv sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"‘My house, the barns, I lost everything’: the Ukrainian farmers devastated by war",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/ukrainian-farmers-war-food-insecurity-famine,2022-05-24T09:36:34Z,Hundreds of farms were destroyed in a war that has worsened food insecurity and threatened famine,"There was a gruelling artillery duel between Ukrainian and Russian troops, positioned just four kilometres apart. Right in the middle, between the two frontlines, stood Ivan Mishchenko’s farmhouse, with his dozens of cows and 100 hectares (247 acres) of wheat fields, transformed into a bloody battleground for five consecutive days in early March. “Two kilometres on the right were the Russian troops, two kilometres on the left were our troops,” said Mishchenko, 66, whose farm lies in the countryside around Pochepyn, a small village north of Kyiv. “They were shooting so hard, as if it was some kind of computer game. The first two days I stayed in the house, but then it was so insufferable that I had to leave. When I returned, I was in shock. My house, the warehouse, the barns ... were all destroyed. I lost everything.” Mishchenko, who has livestock and grain fields, is one of hundreds of Ukrainian farmers whose businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, his few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling. Silos and ports across Ukraine are brimming with more than 20 million metric tonnes of grain and corn that has nowhere to go, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast and the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain. Ukraine used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia invaded the country, it has been forced to export by train or via its small Danube River ports. As a result, global wheat prices leaped by 20% in March, owing to the direct impact of the war on wheat production, with the world facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition, at a time when 42 million people were already one step away from famine. David Beasley, the executive director of the UN World Food Programme, which feeds 125 million people and buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, appealed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin: “If you have any heart at all, please open these ports.” “This is not just about Ukraine,” Beasley said last week. “This is about the poorest of the poor who are on the brink of starvation as we speak.” “The war will absolutely cause grain shortage and perhaps hunger,” says Mishchenko. “We already have problems, because even those farmers who managed to sow their fields, they simply don’t have enough fuel to harvest. Another problem – fertilisers; we used to import them from Russia and Belarus, not enough fertiliser means you harvest 20-30% less.” Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine served as one of the world’s leading breadbaskets – exporting roughly 4.5m tonnes of agricultural produce per month through its ports, including 12% of the planet’s wheat, 15% of its corn, and half of its sunflower oil. Last year, Ukraine produced about 33m tonnes of wheat, of which it exported about 20m tonnes, making it the sixth largest exporter globally. This year, with the situation as it stands, according to the satellite analysis company Kayrros, which uses artificial intelligence combined with data from satellites to monitor commodities, the wheat harvest in the country is likely to be down by at least 35% compared with 2021. “I don’t know how to survive,” says Mishchenko, who toured the world before the war with a Ukrainian folk choir. “The government doesn’t have the money to help us rebuild. All the money goes to the army.” The cannon shots of both Russian and Ukrainian artillery destroyed his warehouse, the shed where he worked the grain and the house where he lived with his wife and son, Roman, 42. At least 20 of his cows were shot, the carcasses still lying inside the stables, which were also destroyed. The livestock that survived the bombings have been reduced to skin and bones after a blast incinerated tons of hay. The war not only destroyed Mishchenko’s business. It also took his son-in-law away from him. “He volunteered to join the army and was killed defending Marakiv.” Like many other Ukrainian farmers, Mishchenko will have to start rebuilding everything from scratch. A few days ago, he launched a crowdfunder, and is hoping to resume his business as soon as possible. Mishchenko was one of the first independent growers in Ukraine, after the fall of the Soviet Union. When he bought this piece of land with his wife, back in the early 1990s, all they had was a tiny trailer. Today, the trailer is the only structure left standing after shelling, and that’s where Mishchenko and his son live today. “Thirty years after I built all this, I am back in that trailer,” he said. “All my life – everything I have built with my own hands in these 30 years, was destroyed, in just one moment.” Artem Mazhulin, AFP and Reuters contributed to this report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine, says Emmanuel Macron ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/russia-must-not-be-humiliated-ukraine-emmanuel-macron,2022-06-04T14:54:23Z,French president says door must be left open to allow improvement in diplomatic relations after war,"Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine, Emmanuel Macron has said, to allow an improvement in diplomatic relations between the west and Moscow whenever the war comes to an end. The French president said his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, had made a “historic and fundamental” error in invading Ukraine, but that nevertheless a wider escalation in hostilities had to be avoided. Giving an interview to a group of regional newspapers in his home country, Macron said: “We must not humiliate Russia so that the day the fighting stops, we can build a way out through diplomatic channels.” The role of France was to be that of “a mediating power”, the president added, saying he had put “time and energy” into ensuring the conflict did not escalate into a wider war, including negotiating with the Russian president. “I have lost count of the conversations I have had with Vladimir Putin since December,” Macron said. They amounted to 100 hours’ worth, he added, which were “at the request of” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Macron has consistently sought to engage directly with Putin and has repeatedly called for a ceasefire in the conflict, including on an 80-minute phone call at the end of last month with the Russian leader and the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz. That has led to periodic accusations that the French leader wants Ukraine to make concessions to secure a peace agreement, although the Élysée Palace says any peace agreement must be negotiated between Putin and Zelenskiy, showing “due respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine”. None of the discussions, however, appear to have borne fruit. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine passed the 100-day mark on Friday, with little sign of the war ending amid heavy fighting in the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk. Macron said he believed Putin had “isolated himself” and did not know what to do next. “Isolating oneself is one thing, but being able to get out of it is a difficult path,” the French president added. Elsewhere, the Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said overnight he had spoken to Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, in his efforts to deal with Ankara’s resistance to Finland and Sweden joining the military alliance. Stoltenberg said he had “a constructive phone call” with Erdoğan and welcomed Turkey’s efforts to reach a maritime agreement between Russia and Ukraine to allow for the resumption of food exports from Ukraine’s blockaded ports. Turkey is threatening to block the accession of Finland and Sweden, who have sought to join Nato in the aftermath of Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, accusing the two countries of supporting Kurdish figures Ankara says are terrorists. Erdoğan’s office said the president had emphasised that Sweden and Finland should “make it clear that they have stopped supporting terrorism”, lift defence export restrictions placed on Turkey, and be “ready to show alliance solidarity”. The two Nordic countries had imposed curbs after Turkey launched a military operation to take control of areas in Syria previously held by the country’s Kurdish minority. Stoltenberg tweeted late on Friday that he discussed with Marin “the need to address Turkey’s concerns and move forward” to ensure the Finnish and Swedish membership applications were approved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Boss of devastated Azovstal plant: ‘Steel is as key to Ukraine’s victory as soldiers’,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/ukraine-steel-boss-at-heart-of-mariupol-defence-says-economy-is-key-to-war-effort,2022-06-01T16:42:35Z,"Yuriy Ryzhenkov’s Mariupol steelworks has been stopped, but his company is leading Kyiv’s economic war against Russia","The Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has become one of the symbols of the brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender. The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov. “The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via video link from a company office in Lviv in the west of Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view, the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline.” Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion, and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting. Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets. It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”. Akhmetov, who has links to the UK including past property investments in London, has remained hugely powerful under successive Ukraine administrations, both pro- and anti-Moscow, and has swung behind the current government, saying his allegiance is only to Ukraine and that Russian soldiers should be punished, adding that he would dedicate his wealth to rebuilding the country. Ryzhenkov says he is in regular contact with Akhmetov as well as the Kyiv government, but insists the company is not involved with the “political issues” of its owner. “We’re working as a single team towards Ukrainian victory.” Before the war, Azovstal employed 11,000 people, producing 4m tonnes of steel a year. That has all stopped. Given the scale of the human lives lost, it can be jarring to talk about quotidian business matters. Ryzhenkov raises an eyebrow when asked what Metinvest’s output will be this year, but responds that it will be down at least 60% compared with 2021. Yet there has been “help from the market” in the form of strong steel prices, which have lessened the blow to the company’s finances, which were in any case in relatively good shape before the February invasion began, with cash balances high. Ryzhenkov says the company’s focus around Mariupol has now turned to providing temporary food and shelter for more than half of the workforce who have already left the city. Metinvest is running a “humanitarian hub” in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia, offering medics and psychological help for adults and children. Yet he estimates that 50,000 of its employees are still working in the country. Two more blast furnaces in Zaporizhzhia and the city of Kamianske to the north are working at about 50% and 60% capacity respectively, with most products going to European markets or ports. Iron ore mining facilities in Ukraine are operating at around 35% to 40% capacity, and a coking coalmine is at about 75%. Running a humanitarian operation alongside one of the country’s largest businesses during wartime is not something most chief executives face, but Metinvest has had some preparation. It was forced to move its headquarters from Donetsk after Kremlin-backed separatists first invaded Ukraine’s east in 2014 and turn more towards European markets and non-Russian suppliers for fuel where possible. Then, in the pandemic, it implemented remote working for all eligible staff. The issue is getting the goods to customers. There has been “quite a significant slowdown in the flow of goods”, Ryzhenkov says. Ukraine and EU governments could step in to provide subsidies for transport, he suggests. The situation for food exports is of particular urgency, not just for Ukrainians, but for poorer consumers of imported wheat around the world. “It is a big concern,” he says. “Logistics is the key bottleneck right now for many Ukrainian businesses. The government is trying to restart the economy, but without resolving these logistical difficulties, it’s going to be very difficult. We are concerned about the speed at which these bottlenecks are being ‘debottlenecked’.” Reopening Black Sea ports at Mariupol and Odesa is “the key for economy restart”, he adds. Efforts to increase exports via rail are complicated by the different railway gauges used in Ukraine and Poland, so Metinvest has set up reloading centres in Poland and Slovakia to move products more quickly on to Europe-compatible trains. There is a limit to what can be taken by road, and Ukraine is struggling with severe lack of fuel. Ryzhenkov says government efforts to cap prices have worsened the shortage instead. From the images of Azovstal’s destruction that filtered out – some of them truly extraordinary – it seems like there cannot be much of it left, but the Metinvest boss cautions that the pictures could be “misleading”, with many showing less important auxiliary units, not the key blast furnaces. The brutality of the battle for Mariupol has contributed to international isolation of Russia. (Ryzhenkov praised Boris Johnson’s backing for Ukrainian victory, saying the UK prime minister was sending a “very powerful message, and we can hear it and feel it”.) Putin’s apparent aim was to control Ukraine, but the invasion has prompted Metinvest and many other key parts of the economy to turn decisively away from Moscow. The company is even looking at options to produce more steel in the EU using Ukrainian commodities and Ryzhenkov hopes that Russian steel exports will be targeted by sanctions. Links with Russia of any kind are off the cards for the “foreseeable future”, he says, and Metinvest will “absolutely not” operate from Russian-controlled territory. “Until [the] Russian regime changes, I don’t see how that can be restored.” • This article was amended on 6 June 2022. Before the Russian invasion, Ukraine’s Azovstal plant employed 11,000 people and produced 4m tonnes of steel annually, not 35,000 people and 9.5m tonnes, as an earlier version said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fish fingers containing Russian whitefish still on sale across UK,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/14/fish-fingers-containing-russian-whitefish-still-on-sale-across-uk,2022-05-14T05:00:53Z,Exclusive: Most major supermarkets have carried on buying Russian-caught fish since Ukraine invasion,"Fish fingers sold in most UK supermarkets use whitefish caught by Russian ships, despite many chains pledging to boycott Russian produce. While supermarkets have taken steps to signal their solidarity with Ukraine, rebranding their chicken kievs as kyivs and taking Russian vodka off the shelves, they have carried on buying its fish. Big brands such as Birds Eye and Young’s, as well as most major supermarkets, including Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, still use Russian-caught fish. When approached for comment, many deferred to the British Retail Consortium (BRC), which said the UK relied heavily on Russia for whitefish and that “complex supply chains” meant it was “difficult to find other sources”. Of the major supermarkets, only Marks &amp; Spencer and Waitrose said they had stopped using Russian-caught fish in their own products, though Waitrose still stocks brands that use it. Tesco and Asda have stopped buying directly from Russian suppliers. The government announced in March it would introduce sanctions on Russian whitefish, with a 35% tariff on all imports, but the idea was put on hold after representations from industry. A Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spokesperson insisted the sanctions would be going ahead but that it was “subject to further work on the specific implications for the sector”. Steve Trent, the chief executive of the Environmental Justice Foundation, said: “It is unacceptable that British consumers are being sold fish fingers caught by Russian vessels, unknowingly sending their hard-earned pounds to fund Putin’s war machine. The government should take urgent action to end the sale of Russian-caught fish in the UK.” More than 30% of the whitefish on sale in Britain is caught by Russian ships, according to estimates from industry body Seafish. In 2020, the UK imported 432,000 tonnes of whitefish at a value of £778m, meaning the money going to Russia is likely to be in excess of £200m. Britain imports almost 10 times the volume of cod and haddock that it is able to catch, with 1.5m fish fingers eaten every day. Fish and chip shops are also heavily reliant on Russian supply. The shadow fisheries minister, Daniel Zeichner, said: “Doing all we can to stand beside the people of Ukraine means ever-tightening, effective sanctions on Putin’s Kremlin that includes looking at products which have yet to be effectively targeted. “Labour has been pressing the government on the issue of Russian fish being commonplace on UK supermarket shelves and we are disappointed at their lack of urgency to act on this.” Russia accounts for about 45% of the world’s whitefish supply, largely pollack, cod and haddock, and there is fierce competition to find other sources. Much of the Russian fish caught is then deboned in China or elsewhere before being sold to the UK to be processed, which makes it harder for the public to track supply chains. Aoife Martin, the director of operations at Seafish, said: “A lot of companies have already indicated that they will look at alternative products that they can use in place of Russian fish. But that’s not the sort of thing that you can pivot away from easily or quickly. There isn’t an alternative supply readily available.” As brands scramble to source whitefish elsewhere, the price of fish fingers and other processed fish is expected to soar. Andrew Opie, the director of food &amp; sustainability at the BRC, said: “Russian fish is used extensively in the UK food industry, and businesses will be reviewing their sourcing arrangements. Seafood uses complex supply chains, and it can be difficult to find alternative sources which are cost-effective and do not threaten the future of suppliers or breach contracts. “We are waiting to hear from the government on sanctions and tariffs, but they will be assessing the impact on consumers in terms of price and availability.” A Birds Eye spokesperson said: “With the highest inflation in 40 years increasing food and living costs for many families, we are doing everything we can to continue to provide nutritious and affordable fish products, without compromising on our commitment to only use sustainably certified fish.” Birds Eye said that no sanctions were in place affecting the fish it bought and that it was “accelerating our existing strategy to find alternative sources of sustainable fish” to meet an industry-wide challenge. A Defra spokesperson said: “We, with our allies and partners, are imposing the most punishing sanctions ever on Russia following its unprovoked and illegal invasion of Ukraine.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US intelligence told to keep quiet over role in Ukraine military triumphs,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/07/us-spies-ukraine-russia-military-intelligence,2022-05-07T05:10:23Z,CIA veterans advise successors against ‘unwise’ intelligence boasts that could trigger escalation from Russia,"Former US intelligence officers are advising their successors currently in office to shut up and stop boasting about their role in Ukraine’s military successes. Two stories surfaced in as many days in the American press this week, citing unnamed officials as saying that US intelligence was instrumental in the targeting of Russian generals on the battlefield and in the sinking of the Moskva flagship cruiser on the Black Sea. The initial report in the New York Times on Wednesday about the generals was partially denied by the White House, which said that while the US shares intelligence with Ukrainian forces, it was not specifically shared with the intent to kill Russian general officers. The next day, NBC, the New York Times and the Washington Post all quoted officials as saying that US intelligence had helped Ukraine hit the Moskva with anti-ship missiles last month, making it the biggest Russian ship to be sunk since the second world war. As a general rule, espionage is carried out in secret, though western intelligence agencies have turned that rule on its head over the past few months by going public with what they knew about Russian preparations for invasion, and then with daily reports on the battlefield and from behind Russian lines. The new disclosures are different however, as they concern what the US espionage agencies themselves have been doing, rather than commenting on the state of the war. In both cases, the US was claiming a hand in historic humiliations for Moscow and for Vladimir Putin, triggering warnings of unintended consequences. Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA official, said: “My personal view is it’s unwise. I am surprised at the extent of official confirmation of the role of US intelligence in the sinking of the Moskva, and even more so the killing of the generals. “The big concern is that this sort of public confirmation of this extensive US role in the setbacks dealt to the Russians may provoke Putin into escalation in a way that he might not otherwise feel it necessary to escalate.” John Sipher, who served for 28 years in the CIA’s clandestine service, some of that time in Moscow, thought the decision to disclose details of intelligence sharing was misguided, but for different reasons. “I just think it’s disrespectful to the Ukrainians,” Sipher said. “It’s taking away from the people who are actually on the ground, who are taking advantage of the intelligence, who are collecting their own intelligence, who are fighting day and night.” However, he did not think that it significantly raised the risk of escalation between Russia and Nato. “Putin understands how the game is played. He gets intelligence to try to kill Americans if the situation is reversed, as he did in Afghanistan and other places. The Russians have spent years attacking us with cyber warfare and disinformation,” Sipher said. “So I don’t think them being upset that America is sharing intelligence is a game-changer.” European officials made clear their own intelligence agencies would not be following the US lead. “It’s stupid,” one official said. “I don’t think it is a carefully coordinated leak.” An official from another European country cast doubt on the centrality of US intelligence to the Ukrainian targeting of Russian generals, saying the main factor was the predictability of Russian officers as they followed rigid Soviet-era doctrine. The breakdown in their secure communications equipment and the top-down hierarchy of the Russian army meant the top officers had to travel to the frontlines to be sure their orders were carried out and Ukrainian snipers were waiting for them. In the case of the Moskva, US officials were at pains to emphasise that Ukraine made its own targeting decisions, and drew information from multiple sources. “We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well and have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability,” John Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said. “They’ve been fighting this war against Russia for eight years. It’s not like they are completely blind to the way Russia organises itself and the way Russia conducts itself on the battlefield.” This article was amended on 9/5/22 to correct an error in a quote",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Evacuation operations continue from Mariupol with 40 civilians rescued on Friday – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/06/russia-ukraine-war-rescue-operations-to-resume-in-mariupol-hellscape-un-says-amid-rumours-russia-wants-to-claim-city-for-victory-day-live,2022-05-07T04:55:19Z,<strong>This blog has now closed.

You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. The UK will exempt Ukraine from its ban on providing public support for fossil fuel energy overseas as ministers look to make sure services can continue to operate during the protracted conflict. Business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the energy-related announcements were part of policies aimed at “ramping up” support for Kyiv, according to a report from PA Media. Officials said Ukraine and other parts of eastern Europe would benefit from time-limited exemptions to the UK government’s international fossil fuel support policy to ensure Britain can join global efforts to keep the embattled country’s energy supplies topped up. The policy prevents the UK providing any new direct financial or promotional support for the fossil fuel energy sector overseas but ministers argued that exempting Ukraine would allow London to address the energy security impact of the conflict and quickly respond to requests for assistance. A senior official from the Russian parliament said Friday that Russia will remain in southern Ukraine “forever”, speaking on a visit to the Moscow-controlled city of Kherson, AFP reports. “Russia is here forever. There should be no doubt about this. There will be no return to the past,” Andrey Turchak said, according to a statement from the ruling United Russia party. “We will live together, develop this rich region, rich in historical heritage, rich in the people who live here,” Turchak added. Turchak also announced the opening of humanitarian aid centre in Kherson, for the delivery of food, medicine and essentials. It is the first time a senior Russian official indicated Moscow’s intentions to remain present on Ukrainian territory. Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russian forces after the start of their military operation in Ukraine on 24 February. Over 40 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians captured by Russia, among them 11 women and a cleric, have been freed in a new prisoner exchange, Kyiv said Friday. “Another prisoner exchange has taken place: 41 people, including 11 women were brought home,” Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said in a statement on Telegram. Among those released were 28 soldiers and 13 civilians, one of whom was a member of the clergy of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church. She did not say how many Russians were released in exchange. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. US President Joe Biden and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, in a phone call on Friday, underscored their commitment to holding Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine and discussed efforts to provide security assistance to Ukraine, the White House said in a statement. Both leaders underscored their commitment to continue holding Russia accountable for its brutal actions in Ukraine, and reviewed their ongoing efforts to provide security assistance to the government of Ukraine and economic and humanitarian aid to the millions of Ukrainians affected by the violence.” Biden and Trudeau also discussed their upcoming participation in the Summit of the Americas in June in Los Angeles, it added. Here is a little more detail on the scheduled G7 meeting set to take place on Sunday. The Group of Seven (G7) leaders including US President Joe Biden will hold a video call on Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of unity the day before Russia marks its Victory Day holiday, the White House said. Talks will focus on the latest developments in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, efforts to bolster the country and ways to demonstrate “continued G7 unity in our collective response, including by imposing severe costs for Putin’s war,” a spokesperson for the White House’s National Security Council said on Monday. The leaders of the G7 countries, which include the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Japan, Canada and Italy, will hold their virtual meeting with Zelenskiy on Sunday in the US morning, the spokesperson added. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Biden flew to Ohio for the day, Psaki said the timing of the session was significant because it will take place a day before Putin participates in Victory Day. The holiday on Monday marks the end of World War Two and includes military parades across Russia. Psaki also said US officials are discussing imposing more sanctions on Russian oligarchs and companies as well as taking steps to avoid Russians previously sanctioned from evading them. “I’ll be speaking with the members of the G7 this week about what we’re going to do or not do,” Biden told reporters this week. It is approaching 5am in Kyiv. Here is where things stand: The UN Security Council has issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words “war”, “conflict” or “invasion”. The statement instead “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and voiced “strong support” for Secretary General Antonio Guterres in seeking a peaceful solution to the “dispute”. Evacuation operations are continuing from the besieged southern city of Mariupol with 40 civilians rescued on Friday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed in his latest national address. Three evacuation buses left the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Friday, according to Russian media reports. Buses carrying 25 civilians including children were brought out from the plant to a camp in the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remained trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. The latest US military aid package to Ukraine, announced by president Joe Biden on Friday, is worth $150m, secretary of state Antony Blinken confirmed. The latest tranche of assistance includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment, field equipment and spare parts. It brings Washington’s military assistance to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began to around $3.8bn, Blinken said. Germany will also send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). The UK government has said it will give Ukraine 287 mobile generators in addition to 569 generators it had donated earlier. US officials have said they shared information about the location of the Russian warship Moskva with Ukraine prior to its sinking last month, a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington. However, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby deflected questions about whether the US provided information to Ukraine that helped military leaders target Russian generals, instead saying Ukraine “makes the decisions” when it comes to how they use US intel. “We provide [Ukrainians] what we believe to be relevant and timely information about Russian units that could allow them to adjust and execute their self- defence to the best of their ability,” he said. “The kind of intelligence that we provide them – it’s legitimate, it’s lawful, and it’s limited.” Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Britain’s ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, adding that it strongly protested in relation to new UK sanctions on Russian media. Russia would continue to react “harshly and decisively” to all sanctions imposed by the UK, the ministry said in a statement. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the southern port city of Mariupol is “an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war”. In an address to Chatham House, he said he was “elected as president of Ukraine and not a mini-Ukraine”, and that Russia must first fall back to the territory it held before its invasion on 23 February if peace talks are to succeed. Russian troops are attempting to encircle and storm Severodonetsk, the easternmost city in Ukraine held by Kyiv, a local official said. Severodonetsk’s capture would be a major gain for the Russian army which has refocused its efforts on taking the whole of the eastern Donbas region. Vladimir Putin will send a “doomsday” warning to the west when he leads celebrations on 9 May. On Russia’s Victory Day on Monday, a fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral will include the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, Russia’s defence ministry said. Amnesty International said there was compelling evidence that Russian troops had committed war crimes in the Kyiv area in February and March. Civilians also suffered abuses such as “reckless shootings and torture” at the hands of Russian forces when they occupied an area outside Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha, in the early stages of the invasion, the rights group said in a report. Italian officials have seized a yacht with ties to the Russian government and believed to belong to Russian president Vladimir Putin, according to a release from the Ministry of Economy and Finance on Friday. Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy has accused Russia of “outright nuclear blackmail” during a speech to Chatham House, the international affairs think tank. “Russia is openly talking about nuclear weapons. The time it takes for Russian missiles to reach European cities. They do this because of the sense of impunity. Russia is blackmailing Europe through threats,” he said. The UK government has said it will give Ukraine 287 mobile generators in addition to 569 generators it had donated earlier. The new generators, which are enough to power nearly 8,000 homes, will be used for hospitals, shelters and other essential services in the face of ongoing destruction in eastern Ukraine, the Department for Business, Energy &amp; Industrial Strategy said in a statement on Saturday as reported by Reuters. The government has also relaxed rules on support for overseas fossil fuels to boost supply of vital energy to Ukraine, the statement added. US First Lady Jill Biden arrived in eastern Europe on a four-day trip on Friday intended to reaffirm the US commitment to Ukraine. Biden will meet national leaders and US troops, as well as displaced Ukrainian parents, children, educators and aid workers in Romania and Slovakia. She began her visit by greeting and serving food to troops stationed at a Romanian air base. On Sunday, she is expected to spend Mother’s Day with refugee mothers and their children in Kosice, a border city in eastern Slovakia. “On my way to Romania and Slovakia to spend Mother’s Day with Ukrainian mothers and children who were forced to flee their homes because of Putin’s war,” Biden tweeted on Friday. “I will also visit US troops and express gratitude for the relief efforts of neighbouring countries and aid workers.” Here is a little more detail on US officials deflecting questions that US intelligence helped Ukraine kill top Russian generals and sink the Moskva missile cruiser. The US defence department’s spokesperson, John Kirby, held a press conference on Friday where he was asked about reports that the Pentagon has provided information with Ukrainian leaders to help them target and kill Russian generals. Kirby would not corroborate the reports, instead saying Ukraine “makes the decisions” when it comes to how they use US intel and emphasising the importance of being careful when discussing intelligence-sharing with other countries. Kirby told reporters: We provide [Ukrainians] what we believe to be relevant and timely information about Russian units that could allow them to adjust and execute their self- defence to the best of their ability. ... The Pentagon spokesperson also emphasised that other countries have provided Ukraine with information on Russian troop movements: We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well. And they have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability of their own. ... And if they do decide to do something with that intelligence, then they make the decisions about acting on it.... The kind of intelligence that we provide them – it’s legitimate, it’s lawful, and it’s limited.” Kirby also stressed that Ukraine combines intelligence from many countries and the US is “not the sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians”. Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy has accused Russia of “outright nuclear blackmail” during a speech to Chatham House, the international affairs think tank. Zelenskiy outlined Russia’s “contempt for all international conventions” and what he claimed to be a sense of impunity. Russia is openly talking about nuclear weapons. The time it takes for Russian missiles to reach European cities. They do this because of the sense of impunity. Russia is blackmailing Europe through threats.” “Why is Russia doing all this? Because they think that if they can be held responsible for such crimes, criminal actions, it will be decades later,” he added. “They simply do not believe that the international community can hold those responsible for the war crimes to justice as they are hiding behind the nuclear force.” Zelenskiy continued: Russian state propagandists on their media resources calculate how long it takes for nuclear missiles to hit European capitals. They talk about it publicly, openly. They tell how to detonate nuclear explosives in the ocean to wash away everything in the British Isles with a radioactive wave. They prepare infographics, that is, they are serious about it. They boast that Russia can destroy any state leaving only ‘nuclear ashes’. Moreover, ‘nuclear ashes’ is their quote, which they repeat as a mantra. Why is this happening? This is a feeling of impunity, and we are sure of it. They are accustomed to the fact that business ‘as usual’ has always returned to the relations of all states with Russia.” The latest US military aid package to Ukraine, announced by president Joe Biden on Friday, is worth $150m, secretary of state Antony Blinken confirmed. I have authorised $150 million in additional US arms, equipment, and supplies for Ukraine to reinforce its defences to counter Russia’s offensive in the East,” Blinken said. The latest tranche of assistance includes 25,000 155mm artillery rounds, as well as counter-artillery radars, jamming equipment, field equipment and spare parts. I am announcing another package of security assistance that will provide additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine,” Biden said in a statement. “US support, together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv and hinder Putin’s war aims in Ukraine,” he added. With the latest $150m US security aid package to Ukraine, Washington’s military assistance to Kyiv since the Russian invasion began has reached around $3.8bn, Blinken said. Evacuation operations are continuing from the besieged southern city of Mariupol with 40 civilians rescued on Friday, Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy confirmed in his latest national address We continue the evacuation mission from Mariupol, from Azovstal, with the mediation of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the day, our team organised rescue for more than 40 civilians - women and children. We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, just underground - in shelters. We are also working on diplomatic options to save our military who still remain at Azovstal. Influential mediators are involved. Influential states.” The UN Security Council has issued its first statement on the war in Ukraine, but withheld from using the words “war”, “conflict” or “invasion”. The statement instead “expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine” and voiced “strong support” for Secretary General Antonio Guterres in seeking a peaceful solution to the “dispute”. “The Security Council expresses deep concern regarding the maintenance of peace and security of Ukraine,” it reads. “The Security Council recalls that all Member States have undertaken, under the Charter of the United Nations, the obligation to settle their international disputes by peaceful means.” “The Security Council expresses strong support for the efforts of the Secretary-General in the search for a peaceful solution. Wielding veto power in the council, Russia has stymied all prior bids to adopt a statement on Ukraine. Mexico’s UN ambassador, whose country helped draft the statement, was asked about criticism that it took two months to draft and merely supports the UN secretary general. Juan Ramon De La Fuente told the Associated Press there has to be a start somewhere and is “a very first initial step but it points on the right direction”. That’s it for me today but our coverage will continue with Samantha Lock. Here’s what happened over the last few hours: US defense department spokesperson John Kirby deflected questions about whether the Pentagon provided information to Ukraine that helped military leaders target Russian generals. Howitzer systems provided by the US required training for Ukrainian soldiers, and Kirby told reporters 220 have received training and 150 more are currently being trained. The British ambassador to Moscow was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry to discuss UK sanctions on Russian media. On Monday Biden will sign a bill to ease restrictions on aid his administration plans to provide to Ukraine. Biden also announced that a $150 million aid package in the works that will include 25,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars and jamming equipment. A yacht belonging to Putin was reportedly seized by Italian officials. Biden urged top intelligence and defense officials to stop leaks about the US providing key information to aid Ukrainian forces. In a call with top defense and intelligence officials, Biden called for fewer leaks about US intelligence sharing with Ukraine, NBC News reports: On the phone with CIA Director William Burns, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Biden’s message was that such disclosures “distract from our objective,” one official said. The other official said Biden conveyed that the leaks should stop. The CIA and the Office of the DNI declined to comment. The Pentagon and the National Security Council did not respond to requests for comment. US officials previously confirmed claims that American intelligence helped Ukrainian forces, aiding both in the killing Russian generals and the location of the Russian warship Moskva, which was sunk last month. The Guardian’s Dan Sabbagh wrote today that confirmation of the information sharing around the Moskva is a “a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington”: It is unclear how far the US intelligence helped Ukraine launch an accurate double missile strike on the Moskva, and the US officials briefing the information insisted the targeting decision was a matter for the Ukrainians alone. But the fact that the US was willing to confirm it had at least some involvement, three weeks after the Moskva went down on 14 April, shows how far Washington is willing to acknowledge its critical backseat role in the 10-week-long war, even at the risk of openly antagonising Moscow.” It appears now that the President is uncomfortable with the reports. Administration officials have expressed fears that the close association and intelligence sharing could provoke Putin into an escalation. Despite the reports, the Administration denied claims that the US was involved in the attack on the Russian ship and that information was aided in targeting the Russian generals. While efforts to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal plant in Mariupol continue, Zelenskiy said he also has hopes to get the remaining members of the military out safely. In his nightly address, the Ukrainian president said the mediation of the UN and the International Committee of the Red cross has helped with civilians but that “influential states” are supporting the safe withdrawal of Ukrainian soldiers. “During the day, our team organized rescue operations for more than 40 civilians, all women and children,” Zelenskiy said. “We hope that soon they will be able to arrive in a safe area after two months of shelling, remaining underground in shelters.” Yacht belonging to Putin reportedly seized Italian officials have seized a yacht with ties to the Russian government, according to a release from the Ministry of Economy and Finance on Friday. Reporters say the yacht, which had been moored in a Tuscany marina, belongs to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The ministry said in its statement the boat was seized under regulations relating to “actions undermining or threatening the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine”. The seizure comes after a $300m yacht belonging to another Russian oligarch was seized by Fijian authorities at the request of the US Department of Justice on Friday. President Biden released a statement saying that his administration “has nearly exhausted funding that can be used to send security assistance through drawdown authorities for Ukraine”. Calling for the US to “keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Ukraine, without interruption” Biden pushed Congress to quickly provide the funding he’s requested. Though he did not specify in the statement the financial total for the latest package, Reuters reports it will amount to $150m and include 25,000 artillery rounds, counter-artillery radars and jamming equipment. Here’s the president’s statement in full: Today, the United States is continuing our strong support for the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their country against Russia’s ongoing aggression. I am announcing another package of security assistance that will provide additional artillery munitions, radars, and other equipment to Ukraine. The United States has provided a historic amount of security assistance to Ukraine at rapid speed. We are sending the weapons and equipment that Congress has authorized directly to the front lines of freedom in Ukraine. U.S. support, together with the contributions of our Allies and partners, has been critical in helping Ukraine win the battle of Kyiv and hinder Putin’s war aims in Ukraine. With today’s announcement, my Administration has nearly exhausted funding that can be used to send security assistance through drawdown authorities for Ukraine. For Ukraine to succeed in this next phase of war its international partners, including the U.S., must continue to demonstrate our unity and our resolve to keep the weapons and ammunition flowing to Ukraine, without interruption. Congress should quickly provide the requested funding to strengthen Ukraine on the battlefield and at the negotiating table.” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined what he would consider a victory for his country on Friday, saying peace negotiations with Moscow would only be considered if Russian troops retreated from all occupied territory they gained after 24 February. Zelenskiy emphasized that he still has hope for diplomacy but his conditions would be firm, the Washington Post reports. “Despite the fact that they destroyed all our bridges, I think not all the bridges are yet destroyed, figuratively speaking,” he said, adding that Ukraine is his only objective. “For me what matters is Ukraine’s victory, and by Ukraine’s victory I mean something that belongs to us.” Roughly 50 civilians, including women, children, and seniors, were evacuated today from the bunkers under the besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, the New York Times reports, adding to nearly 500 people who have escaped in recent days. The effort to safely evacuate civilians has been complicated has been slow because Russian troops have repeatedly violated a cease-fire intended to open safe evacuations for civilians, according to the deputy prime minister Iryna Vereschuk. She added that a convoy of vehicles was delayed for most of the day due to the dangers. “Tomorrow morning we will continue the operation,” she said. Eleven children were among those rescued from the ruined plant on Friday. The group was left with representatives from the International Committee of the Red Cross and the United Nations. Residents in Kyiv have been warned to stay inside on Sunday while Russians celebrate Victory Day, a holiday commemorating the Nazi surrender during the second world war. Events will be canceled, city patrols will be bolstered, and, while there won’t be an official curfew, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the risks of shelling are high. Cautioning residents to follow “wartime security rules,” Klitschko told locals not to ignore air alarm signals. “In the coming days, there is a high likelihood of missile shelling in all regions of Ukraine. Be aware and take care of your own safety!” There are concerns that Putin will formally declare war that day and call for an escalation, according to CNN. Putin has used the rhetoric and imagery from the second world war to fuel support for the invasion of Ukraine in Russia, falsely claiming that Russians were seeking the “denazification” of the country. In recent years, while celebrating a win in what they refer to as “the great patriotic war,” Russians have adopted a slogan with their Victory Day celebrations: “We can do it again”. Putin has planned for a propaganda-filled day. Reuters reports: Defiant in the face of deep Western isolation since he ordered the invasion of Russia’s neighbour, Putin will speak on Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. A fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral will include supersonic fighters, Tu-160 strategic bombers and, for the first time since 2010, the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, the Defence Ministry said. In that scenario, the Il-80 is designed to become the roaming command centre for the Russian president. It is packed with technology but specific details are Russian state secrets. Gabrielle Canon here, taking over to go through the news with you for the next few hours. More US aid is on the way. President Biden is expected to announce a new assistance package amounting to more than $100 million, Reuters reports. The president will virtually speak with other G7 leaders on Sunday as Russians celebrate “Victory Day” a holiday commemorating the Nazi surrender in World War II. The amount builds on billions the US has already contributed in humanitarian and military assistance and follows the president’s proposal to Congress last week for $33bn in aid. The proposal before Congress is more than double the last request approved in March and “dwarfs the entire defence budget of Ukraine and of many other countries” according to The Guardian’s Julian Borger and Jon Henley who covered the package last week. Biden has made the case that a win for Putin would threaten global peace but emphasized in his request that defending Ukraine was the focus: “Despite the disturbing rhetoric coming out of the Kremlin, the facts are plain for everybody to see. We’re not attacking Russia. We’re helping Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression,” Biden said. But he added the cost involved was “a small price to pay to punish Russia and aggression, to lessen the risk of future conflicts”. “Throughout our history, we’ve learned that when dictators do not pay the price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and engage in more aggression,” he said. “The threats to America and the world keep rising. We can’t let this happen.” Fifty more civilians, including 11 children, were rescued today from the besieged steel plant in Mariupol as Russian forces try to take control of the facility, AP reports. The Russian Interdepartmental Humanitarian Response Center, a Russian government agency, said the rescued civilians were handed over to representatives of the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Efforts to rescue more civilians from the plant are expected to continue Saturday, but the Ukrainian fighters at the site have refused to surrender to Russian troops, even as the battle has intensified. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said her colleagues are on the ground in Mariupol and would continue their rescue efforts: We are in an extremely delicate phase of this operation, working in close coordination with both the Ukrainian authorities and the Russian authorities. The White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, said Joe Biden will sign the Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 on Monday. The bill, which passed both chambers of the US Congress last month, will ease restrictions on the aid that the Biden administration provides to Ukraine amid its war against Russia. The Democratic speaker of the US House, Nancy Pelosi, celebrated the bill’s strong bipartisan support in a floor speech last week: In his 1941 State of the Union address, President Roosevelt explained that democracy itself, democracy itself was under direct – was under dire threat, not only in Europe, but around the world. And he called on Congress to lend a hand to our allies overseas: bolstering their defenses so they can defeat the evils of fascism. It was this initiative that would be enacted just two months later – then undeniably turned the tide of the Second World War. And the Lend-Lease program would help propel the Allies to a victory that preserved the promise of democracy for generations to come. Today, we see an echo of that [chapter] in history, as a murderous tyrant seeks to conquer its neighbor and dismantle its democracy. At this moment – and this moment demands we summon a commitment response – a commitment to respond. The Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 revives this pivotal program, waiving time-consuming requirements on the president’s authority to send critical defensive resources to Ukraine. It’s important to note that it’s about time. Time is very important when lives are at stake. The exiled journalists of the Russian opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta have launched a new outlet in Latvia, AFP reports. The first issue of Novaya Gazeta.Europe hit news stands in Riga today. The development comes weeks after the paper was forced to suspend its operations, as the Kremlin cracked down on opposition journalists following the invasion of Ukraine. The newspaper’s publisher, the Rigas Vilni publishing house, said Novaya Gazeta.Europe “is a publication created by free Russian journalists who were forced to migrate”. The publishing house added: It is their independent point of view on the events of the war in Ukraine and developments in Russia. Kirill Martynov, who is leading the paper, said on Latvian public radio: When Russian propaganda makes May 9 (marking the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945) its day, Novaya Gazeta will be on news stands as a symbol of the fact they didn’t succeed in shutting us down. Martynov also said he hopes copies of the newspaper would find their way to Russia, “even illegally”. Patrick Wintour, the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, has more details on the Kremlin summoning the British ambassador to Russia to discuss sanctions on Russian media: The British ambassador to Moscow, Deborah Bronnert, has been summoned to the Russian foreign ministry to be warned over new UK sanctions imposed on Russian media outlets, in a move seen as likely to presage reprisals on British press operations in Russia. In a statement late on Friday, the ministry said Russia would continue react “harshly and decisively” to all sanctions imposed by London. The UK earlier this week announced sanctions against the state-owned television station Channel One, accusing it of “spreading disinformation in Russia, justifying Putin’s ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
llegal invasion as a ‘special military operation’”. Britain also imposed sanctions on a group of Russian journalists embedded with the Russian army in Ukraine, including Evgeny Poddubny, a war correspondent for the All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Alexander Kots, a war correspondent for the Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, and Dmitry Steshin, a special correspondent for the same outlet. John Kirby, the US defense department spokesperson, said today that 220 Ukrainian soldiers have already been trained on the howitzer artillery systems. Another 150 are currently being trained. The last two US military aid packages to Ukraine included 90 howitzer systems, but the Pentagon acknowledged that Ukrainian troops would need to be trained before operating them on their own. That training has been happening at a location in Eastern Europe that is outside of Ukraine, per CNBC. The US defense department’s spokesperson, John Kirby, was also asked about reports that Ukrainian missiles have struck the Russian frigate Admiral Makarov. Kirby told reporters at his briefing this afternoon: We’ve been looking at this all day, and we have no information to corroborate those reports. If true, the attack on the Makarov would mark the latest of Russia’s significant naval losses in its war against Ukraine, after the sinking of the Russian warship Moskva last month. US officials confirmed yesterday that they provided Ukrainian leaders with information on the location of the Moskva before the missile strike on the ship, although it’s unclear how crucial that intelligence was in carrying out the attack. The US defense department’s spokesperson, John Kirby, held a press conference this afternoon, and he was unsurprisingly asked about reports that the Pentagon has provided information with Ukrainian leaders to help them target and kill Russian generals. Kirby would not corroborate the reports, emphasizing the importance of being careful when discussing intelligence-sharing with other countries. Kirby told reporters: We provide [Ukrainians] what we believe to be relevant and timely information about Russian units that could allow them to adjust and execute their self- defense to the best of their ability. ... The Pentagon spokesperson also emphasized that other countries have provided Ukraine with information on Russian troop movements: We are not the only sole source of intelligence and information to the Ukrainians. They get intelligence from other nations as well. And they have a pretty robust intelligence collection capability of their own. ... And if they do decide to do something with that intelligence, then they make the decisions about acting on it. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Léonie Chao-Fong. The British prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke to the French president, Emmanuel Macron, earlier today to congratulate him on his recent reelection and discuss the latest developments in Ukraine. Johnson’s office said in a readout of the call: On Ukraine, the Prime Minister and President Macron were united in their condemnation of Putin’s deadly folly and agreed to coordinate more closely on longer-term security and economic support for Ukraine, as well as measures to isolate Russia. The Prime Minister updated on his visit to Kyiv last month and shared his conviction that Ukraine would win, supported with the right level of defensive military assistance. He urged against any negotiations with Russian on terms that gave credence to the Kremlin’s false narrative for the invasion, but stressed that this was a decision for the Ukrainian government. Reading between the lines of the readout, it seems like Johnson sent a sharp message about the need to hold a firm line regarding peace terms in Ukraine, as noted by the Guardian’s Patrick Wintour: It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Three evacuation buses left the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol on Friday, according to Russian media reports. Buses carrying 25 civilians including children were brought out from the plant to a camp in the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remained trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. US officials have said they shared information about the location of the Russian warship Moskva with Ukraine prior to its sinking last month, a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Britain’s ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, adding that it strongly protested in relation to new UK sanctions on Russian media. Russia would continue to react “harshly and decisively” to all sanctions imposed by the UK, the ministry said in a statement. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the southern port city of Mariupol is “an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war”. In an address to Chatham House, he said he was “elected as president of Ukraine and not a mini-Ukraine”, and that Russia must first fall back to the territory it held before its invasion on 23 February if peace talks are to succeed. Russian troops are attempting to encircle and storm Severodonetsk, the easternmost city in Ukraine held by Kyiv, a local official said. Severodonetsk’s capture would be a major gain for the Russian army which has refocused its efforts on taking the whole of the eastern Donbas region. Vladimir Putin will send a “doomsday” warning to the west when he leads celebrations on 9 May. On Russia’s Victory Day on Monday, a fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral will include the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, Russia’s defence ministry said. Amnesty International said there was compelling evidence that Russian troops had committed war crimes in the Kyiv area in February and March. Civilians also suffered abuses such as “reckless shootings and torture” at the hands of Russian forces when they occupied an area outside Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha, in the early stages of the invasion, the rights group said in a report. Germany will send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my US colleagues. Thank you for reading. A third bus, carrying 23 civilian evacuees, left the Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, the Russian state-owned news agency Tass reported. According to Tass, there are plans for a fourth bus to depart the plant before the humanitarian corridor is closed at 9pm local (1800 GMT). Buses carrying civilians out of the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol have arrived in the Russian-controlled town of Bezimenne. The coaches were seen arriving at the camp and evacuees were accompanied to the reception centre by representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN, which have been helping to organise the evacuations, Reuters reports. Officials at the centre said they expected several buses to arrive from the Azovstal plant, where hundreds of civilians and fighters are believed to be holed up. Ukrainian officials had accused Russia of violating a ceasefire on Friday aimed at evacuating scores of civilians still trapped underground in the plant, after fighting thwarted efforts to rescue them the previous day. Posters accusing famous Swedish figures of supporting Nazism have appeared in Moscow in a sign of worsening relations between Russia and Sweden, Reuters reports. At a bus stop outside the Swedish embassy in the Russian capital, two photographs of Swedish King Gustaf V, writer Astrid Lindgren, film director Ingmar Bergman and Ikea founder Ingvar Kamprad with the message: “We are against Nazism, they are not.” A third poster was spotted on a major thoroughfare in central Moscow. Asked about the posters, Sweden’s foreign ministry said in a statement that Sweden “has no intention of engaging in a public polemic with the Russian organisation ‘Our Victory’, which is reportedly behind these posters”, adding: In Russia, accusations of ‘Nazism’ have repeatedly been deployed against countries and individuals who express justifiable criticism of Russia’s actions. US officials have said they shared information about the location of the Russian warship Moskva with Ukraine prior to its sinking last month, a fresh demonstration of the close intelligence support Kyiv is receiving from Washington. It is unclear how far the US intelligence helped Ukraine launch an accurate double missile strike on the Moskva, and the US officials briefing the information insisted the targeting decision was a matter for the Ukrainians alone. But the fact that the US was willing to confirm it had at least some involvement, three weeks after the Moskva went down on 14 April, shows how far Washington is willing to acknowledge its critical backseat role in the 10-week-long war, even at the risk of openly antagonising Moscow. On Thursday US officials confirmed, first to NBC News, that they provided location information about the Moskva before it was struck. However, Ukraine has its own surveillance capacity, so it is not certain whether the US information was critical. Tracking the location of Russian warships in the Black Sea, which have been threatening Odesa and have launched missile strikes against other Ukrainian cities, has been going on for some time, the officials added. Last month Ukraine fired two Neptune cruise missiles at the Moskva, a missile cruiser with a crew of about 500. It sank after a fire. The number of casualties is not known, although the sinking is one of the biggest naval losses in war seen by any nation for decades. A second evacuation bus has left the besieged Azovstal plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria is reporting. This is in addition to a previous bus carrying 12 civilians, including children, which reportedly left the plant earlier today. The second bus is carrying 13 civilians, including one child, according to Ria. Russia’s foreign ministry said it had summoned Britain’s ambassador to Russia, Deborah Bronnert, adding that it strongly protested in relation to new UK sanctions on Russian media. Russia would continue to react “harshly and decisively” to all sanctions imposed by the UK, the ministry said in a statement. Earlier this month, the UK announced sanctions on individual journalists and media organisations in a bid to increase pressure on Moscow. More than “500,000 Ukrainians have been deported to Russia” since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said during an address to Iceland’s parliament. Zelenskiy said: They were forced to go there. Their documents and means of communication are confiscated. They are sent to faraway regions of that foreign land in order to assimilate there. In his speech to the Icelandic parliament, Zelenskiy underlined the centuries-old ties between the two countries and thanked Iceland for taking part in sanctions against Russia. His address marked the first time a foreign head of state made a speech in Alþingi, Iceland’s parliament. Iceland’s foreign minister, Thórdís Gylfadóttir, said the country “stands ready to do everything” within its power to help Ukraine. Ukraine’s finance minister, Serhiy Marchenko, called for a complete international embargo on Russian oil and gas over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine is struggling to balance its budget after 10 weeks of war, Marchenko told an online briefing, adding that he could not be satisfied with the speed at which financial assistance was arriving from abroad. Due to what he called the “insufficiency of the sanctions” that have been introduced, Moscow still felt “quite comfortable” because of the high price of oil and natural gas, he said. Marchenko said: The main issue is a complete embargo on the purchase of gas and oil from the Russian Federation. This is something that needs to be worked on and that the Ukrainian authorities are actively working on. This will make it possible to remove the possibility of financing the war. A bus carrying 12 civilians, including children, has left the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol, the Russian state-owned news agency Ria is reporting. The Guardian has not been able to verify this report. War-torn Ukraine is the favourite to win next week’s Eurovision song contest, which is being hosted by Italy for the first time in more than 30 years. Kalush Orchestra, a band that blends traditional folk and hip-hop, is competing in the event with the song Stefania, which has become an anthem at home. Written by frontman Oleh Psiuk as a tribute to his mother, Stefania is also the most watched on YouTube among the 35 contenders. In an interview with the Italian news agency Ansa, Psiuk said his band’s entry was tipped to do well even before Russia invaded in February. “Some people are saying we could win because of the war, but our song was among the five favourites before the start of the conflict, which means people like it regardless,” he said. Kalush Orchestra, a six-person band, was given special permission to travel to the northern Italian city of Turin, which is hosting the competition on 10-14 May, although Psiuk said one band member stayed in Ukraine to fight. “Those of us here represent every Ukrainian,” he said. “After Eurovision we will return home to provide our contribution.” It is almost 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A third United Nations operation was under way on Friday morning to evacuate Ukrainian civilians from the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. An estimated 200 civilians, along with Ukrainian resistance fighters, remained trapped in underground refuges at the huge industrial complex. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says the southern port city of Mariupol is “an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war”. In an address to Chatham House, he said he was “elected as president of Ukraine and not a mini-Ukraine”, and that Russia must first fall back to the territory it held before its invasion on 23 February if peace talks are to succeed.

Vladimir Putin will send a “doomsday” warning to the west when he leads celebrations on 9 May. On Russia’s Victory Day on Monday, a fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral will include the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, Russia’s defence ministry said. Amnesty International said there was compelling evidence that Russian troops had committed war crimes in the Kyiv area in February and March. Civilians also suffered abuses such as “reckless shootings and torture” at the hands of Russian forces when they occupied an area outside Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha, in the early stages of the invasion, the rights group said in a report. The Kremlin has declined to say whether the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, apologised to Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, for his foreign minister’s claims that Adolf Hitler had Jewish blood. In his briefing with reporters today, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov also said there was hostile rhetoric coming out of Poland, and that Warsaw could be “a source of threat”. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a warning against public gatherings in the Ukrainian capital over the weekend. The days following Orthodox Easter are often in Ukraine a time to visit the graves and last resting places of loved ones, but Klitschko warned: “If someone wants to go lay flowers, they can do so privately. Nearly 25m tonnes of grain are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country, a UN food agency said. The blockages, due to infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, are seen as a factor behind the record-high food prices in March, the FAO said. The European Commission has amended a proposal for an embargo on Russian oil to extend the period before it takes effect for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic, according to reports. Under the tweaked proposal, Hungary and Slovakia will continue to be able to buy Russian oil from pipelines until the end of 2024, whereas the Czech Republic could continue until June 2024. Germany will send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I will continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. Russian troops are attempting to encircle and storm Severodonetsk, the easternmost city in Ukraine held by Kyiv, a local official said. Oleksandr Striuk, the head of the Severodonetsk military administration, said on national television: The city is almost surrounded by Russian and (separatist) Luhansk People’s Republic troops. They are trying to storm the city through nearby villages. Severodonetsk’s capture would be a major gain for the Russian army which has refocused its efforts on taking the whole of the eastern Donbas region, AFP reports. Ongoing fighting was taking place in a village just north of the city, Striuk said. He said the Ukrainian army was so far “repelling these attacks” but the Russians were pressing on. The city is holding on, but one can feel that they are trying to get around. He said about 15,000 people remained in Severodonetsk, which had a population of around 100,000 before the war. Regional authorities have for weeks been urging people to leave the city. Vladimir Putin will send a “doomsday” warning to the west when he leads celebrations on 9 May, marking the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in the second world war, Reuters reports. On Russia’s Victory Day on Monday, the president is expected to deliver a speech on Moscow’s Red Square before a parade of troops, tanks, rockets and intercontinental ballistic missiles. Russia’s defence ministry said supersonic fighters and Tu-160 strategic bombers will conduct a fly-past over St Basil’s Cathedral. For the first time since 2010, the Il-80 “doomsday” command plane, which would carry Russia’s top brass in the event of a nuclear war, will join the fly-past. In the event of a nuclear war, the “doomsday” plane would become the roaming command centre for the Russian president. It is packed with technology but specific details are Russian state secrets. Putin has repeatedly likened his war in Ukraine to the Soviet Union’s fight against the Nazis, casting Russia’s invasion as a battle to protect Russian speakers from persecution by Nazis. Ukraine and the west dismiss the claims as nonsense and say the Russian leader is waging an unprovoked war of aggression. Ahead of 9 May, western officials have speculated that Putin could use the Victory Parade to announce an escalation of military action, perhaps an outright declaration of war. The Kremlin has dismissed those suggestions, describing them as “nonsense”. It has not said what Putin may say in his speech on Monday. Earlier today Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, took part in a live-streaming session hosted by the thinktank Chatham House. His next engagement is to address the Icelandic parliament, where he will become the first-ever foreign head of state to do so. There is a livestream of the event available here if you want to watch. Our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, was watching Ukraine’s president address an online forum hosted by Chatham House this afternoon: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said not all diplomatic bridges with Russia are broken, but Russia must first fall back to the territory it held before its invasion on 23 February if peace talks are to succeed. He said “I was elected as president of Ukraine and not a mini-Ukraine”, and said he could not let Ukraine’s population be reduced by 11 million by losing territory and including those who had fled abroad. He said he saw no Russian desire for peace. Asked if he agreed with western leaders who called for Vladimir Putin to be defeated, he said: “For some it may be Putin’s defeat, and in our society there is a big proportion of people who think exactly like that. I don’t care where leaders end up, but what matters to me is Ukraine’s victory. Victory is for me not to lose 11 million people – 5 million that have left Ukraine.” He added that a victory for Ukraine included bringing the country back economically to the situation where it had started from, and urged accession to the European Union, saying “that is the will of the Ukrainian people”. He also accused the Russians of bestial brutality in trying to take Mariupol, adding he was deeply worried by the propaganda and hatred instilled in people by Moscow’s information machine, saying: “Goebbels was a child in comparison with the adults in the Kremlin. That is the scariest thing.” He said Mariupol as a city cannot fall, because it is already devastated. “There is no place. There is no structure. It is all destroyed completely.” He warned the Russians that if they killed civilians or military personnel that could in theory be exchanged as PoWs, there can be no peace talks in the future. He promised Ukraine could block Russian advances, providing it was supplied with the necessary equipment. He urged the west to do more to bring those responsible for war crimes to justice more quickly, saying: “Russian leaders believe responsibility can be postponed for decades if it ever comes.” Russia, he said, “believed it had impunity because they have the power of the nuclear state and the nuclear blackmail”. He said Russian propaganda managers “are calculating how much time for a nuclear missile to hit European capitals. They talk about it openly about how they can make a nuclear blast in the ocean to wash away the British Isles. They boast about turning any state into nuclear ashes. They have this feeling of impunity.” He urged the European Union to act together on energy sanctions, saying some states still play a dangerous game. He said if Europe failed to act, “when you realise they are at your borders, you will understand Nordstream 2 or 3 or Nordstream 100 are not worth anyone’s health and life. They will push your family and burn your household.” He urged the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, to come to Kyiv. Without naming any country he accused some of wanting to strike a balance. “They want to be in the grey area and stay in the shadow, walking between the drops of rain. But this is not a rain. It never rains but it pours. Everyone is soaking wet.” Earlier today the Telegram channel of the Azov regiment that is holed up in Mariupol posted a claim that Russian forces fired on a car that was intended to be evacuating civilians. They posted: During the ceasefire on the territory of the Azovstal plant a car was hit by Russians who used anti-tank guided weapon. This car was moving towards civilians in order to evacuate them from the plant. As the result of the shelling, one fighter was killed and six were wounded. The enemy continues to violate all agreements and fail to adhere to security guarantees of civilians evacuation. The channel has just posted a video which purports to show the injuries sustained by one person, and still images of the aftermath of the attack. The claims have not been independently verified. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has issued a warning via Telegram against public gatherings in Kyiv over the weekend. Saying that a curfew will not be imposed, he nevertheless told residents: “Let me remind you, mass events are prohibited during martial law.” The days following Orthodox Easter are often in Ukraine a time to visit the graves and last resting places of loved ones, but Klitschko warned: “If someone wants to go lay flowers, they can do so privately.” Promising increased patrols in the city, the message continued: I appeal to Kyivites: today is not the time for mass festivities or outdoor recreation in large groups. Be careful and follow the rules of security in wartime. I would also like to remind you that visiting forests and forest park zones in the capital and suburbs is prohibited. Because in many of them there are still unexploded munitions. Also, please do not ignore the air alarms and immediately follow to the shelter. In the coming days, there is a high probability of rocket fire in all regions of Ukraine. Daniel Boffey reports for us from Ukraine that the wives of soldiers trapped in Mariupol have been dispersed by police at a Kyiv protest: Wives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege in Mariupol gathering in Kyiv to demand the evacuation of their husbands have been dispersed by police who gave army conscription notices to the male protesters. Around 50 people had defied a government ban on Friday morning to take part in a protest on the Ukrainian capital’s independence square where they called for negotiations with the Russians over the soldiers fate. The UN has opened a fresh attempt to rescue the remaining 200 civilians trapped in the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of “hellscapes”. However, the negotiations with the Russian military have not included the fate of around 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers fighting at the sprawling works, leading to a series of protests in recent days by their relatives. Police officers ordered the women at the latest protest to leave the square as the event had not been authorised and gave conscription orders to a number of men. Yulia Girdvilis, the head of the communication department of Kyiv police, said: “There were no arrests. There were police officers at the event who explained that during the martial law mass events are not allowed and people dispersed on their own. “There were military commissars present at the event who had the authority to check men’s documents. Some of the men in their 30s were taken to the draft boards [conscription offices] for further investigations.” Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report here: Wives of Mariupol soldiers dispersed by police at Kyiv protest Asked what the minimum he would accept in a peace deal with Russia would be, Zelenskiy replies: I was elected by the people of Ukraine as the president of Ukraine, not as president of a mini-Ukraine. Russian troops must fall back and withdraw so that Ukraine can reclaim all of its territories as of before Russia’s invasion, he says. Addressing Chatham House, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, says the devastated southern port city of Mariupol is “an example of torture and starvation used as a weapon of war”, adding that no international organisations can enter the city. Zelenskiy says: This inhumanity and cruelty is how the Russian military treats people. Death is not caused by war. This is not a military event. This is torturing to death. This is terrorism and hatred. Mariupol has been devastated, he says. The entire city has been destroyed. Ukraine needs weapons and equipment to break the blockade at the city’s Azovstal steelworks, Zelenskiy says. “Russia will keep attacking Ukraine until we stop them.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, is addressing the foreign policy thinktank Chatham House, where he says Russia does not believe it will be held for war crimes in Ukraine because of “nuclear blackmail”. Zelenskiy says: Russia is openly talking about nuclear weapons. The time it takes for Russian missiles to reach European cities. They do this because of the sense of impunity. Russia is blackmailing Europe through threats. The invasion of Russia and its “cruelty” of its troops in Ukraine “has ignored all human rights norms and is something from the 18th century”, he said: Russia believes it will not be held responsible for war crimes. Nearly 25m tonnes of grain are stuck in Ukraine and unable to leave the country, because of infrastructure challenges and blocked Black Sea ports including Mariupol, a UN food agency said. The blockages are seen as a factor behind the record-high food prices in March; Ukraine had been the world’s fourth largest exporter of maize (corn) and sixth largest wheat exporter, according to International Grains Council data. The full silos could result in storage shortages during the next harvest in July and August, Josef Schmidhuber, a deputy director at Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said, adding: Despite the war the harvest conditions don’t look that dire. That could really mean there’s not enough storage capacity in Ukraine, particularly if there’s no wheat corridor opening up for export from Ukraine. Another concern is reports that some grain storage had been destroyed in the fighting in Ukraine, he added, without giving details. Earlier this week, the head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said she was “seriously worried” about spiralling food prices. Okonjo-Iweala told Reuters: It would really help the world if we could evacuate this grain (from Ukraine). There’s a serious risk of food prices going up and spiralling out of affordability that could lead to more hunger. About 3.8m people left Russia in the first quarter of 2022, official statistics show, with most people going to Georgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan and Finland. Journalist Alex Luhn writes that the figure of 3.8m includes most of the pro-Western, opposition-minded people in Russia. Germany will send seven self-propelled howitzers to Ukraine, on top of five artillery systems the Dutch government has already pledged, the German defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, said. The seven Panzerhaubitze 2000 howitzers, described by their manufacturer as “the most powerful tube artillery system in the world”, will be delivered over the next few weeks, Lambrecht told reporters. The PzH 2000 is one of the most powerful artillery weapons in the Bundeswehr inventories and can hit targets at a distance of 40km (25 miles). Twenty Ukrainian troops will be given training on the howitzers next week in Germany, Lambrecht’s defence chief, Gen Eberhard Zorn, said. These troops have experience in operating Soviet-built howitzers, he said. Berlin will also supply a first ammunition package for the howitzers built by German defence company KMW, Zorn said, with further ammunition purchases to be handled directly between Kyiv and the company. Last week, Germany reversed its long-held policy of not sending heavy weapons to war zones following pressure from European allies and at home for being slow to help Ukraine in its defence against Russian forces. G7 leaders will take part in a video conference with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, on Sunday, a spokesperson for the German government said. The talks will cover “current issues, particularly the situation in Ukraine ... Zelenskiy will take part and report on the current situation in his country”, the spokesperson said, adding: 8 May is a historic date which marks the end of world war two in Europe which caused terror, destruction and death in Europe. Amnesty International said there was compelling evidence that Russian troops had committed war crimes, including extrajudicial executions of civilians, in the Kyiv area in February and March. Civilians also suffered abuses such as “reckless shootings and torture” at the hands of Russian forces when they occupied an area outside Ukraine’s capital, including the town of Bucha, in the early stages of the invasion, the rights group said in a report. Donatella Rovera, Amnesty’s senior crisis response adviser, said: These are not isolated incidents. These are very much part of a pattern wherever Russian forces were in control of a town or a village. The report concluded that Russian troops had committed a “host of apparent war crimes” in Bucha, including “numerous unlawful killings”, most of them near the intersection of Yablunska and Vodoprovidna streets. It said it had documented 22 cases of unlawful killing by Russian forces – “most of which were apparent extrajudicial executions” – in Bucha and nearby areas. Ukrainian authorities say they are investigating more than 9,000 potential war crimes by Russian troops. The international criminal court is also looking into alleged war crimes. The Kremlin has denied its forces committed abuses in Ukraine, claiming “the Bucha story is a set-up and a fake”. The Kremlin has declined to say whether the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, apologised to Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, for his foreign minister’s claims that Adolf Hitler had Jewish blood. Israel said Putin made the apology during a call with Bennett yesterday. Bennett said he had accepted the apology from Putin, a rare concession from the Kremlin leader and a strong rebuke of his foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov. Lavrov claimed this week in an interview that Hitler “had Jewish blood” and that “the most rabid antisemites tend to be Jews”. The incendiary remarks sparked outrage in Israel. Some other lines from the Kremlin’s briefing with reporters today: Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said there was hostile rhetoric coming out of Poland, and that Warsaw could be “a source of threat”. Peskov’s remarks came amid calls from Poland for the European Union to tighten sanctions and for Nato to arm Ukraine. Earlier this week, the Polish environment and climate minister, Anna Moskwa, said “Poland is proud to be on Putin’s list of unfriendly countries”. Peskov also said he did not know whether there would be a parade in Mariupol on 9 May to commemorate the Soviet Union’s victory in the second world war, adding: “The time will come to mark Victory Day in Mariupol.” Hello, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Shaun Walker, our central and eastern Europe correspondent, reports for us today on how Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity: The rhetoric of victory and of fighting Nazis, which has become gradually more twisted over the past two decades, plays a role. Of course, it takes a particular mindset to look at Russia’s expansionist war, with the executions, targeting of civilians, filtration camps and harassment of dissidents at home, and come to the conclusion that it is the Ukrainians who are the Nazis. But already for some years, the victory cult has been referred to by critics as pobedobesie, a derogatory play on the Russian words for victory and obscurantism – “victorymania” is an approximate English translation. As this pobedobesie metastasised year on year, the phenomenon took on forms that were ever more grotesque: schools put on performances in which the children dressed up as Soviet soldiers; people posing as captured Nazis were paraded through the streets. Ever more opponents of modern Russia were branded as Nazis, neo-Nazis or Nazi accomplices. These days, almost any interview with a Russian official about current events will contain references to the second world war. The foreign ministry tweets about the conflict almost daily. Putin’s influential, hawkish confidant Nikolai Patrushev recently blamed the west for the rise of Hitler, and suggested today’s western world (and their Ukrainian “puppets”) are the true heirs to the Nazis. “You should not be fooled by Anglo-Saxon respectability. Even a sharply tailored suit cannot hide hatred, anger and inhumanity,” he raged. Read more of Shaun Walker’s report here: How Victory Day became central to Putin’s idea of Russian identity Rescue operations to evacuate civilians trapped in besieged Mariupol are set to resume today as Russia’s assault on the Azovstal steel works plant continues. The Mariupol local authority has posted on its Telegram channel to thank those who have been carrying out evacuations from the city. Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential staff in Ukraine, said this morning a new attempt was under way to evacuate civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks. He said “The next stage of rescuing our people from Azovstal is under way at the moment. Information about the results will be provided later.” Russian forces have continued their ground assault on the Azovstal steelworks for a second day, despite Russian statements claiming they would seek only to seal it off, the UK’s ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, described the war zone in Mariupol as appearing to be “hellscapes”. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steel plant area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. Reports suggest the European Commission has amended a proposal for an embargo on Russian oil to extend the period before it takes effect for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Under the tweaked proposal, Hungary and Slovakia will continue to be able to buy Russian oil from pipelines until the end of 2024, whereas the Czech Republic could continue until June 2024. Russia’s defence ministry said its missiles destroyed a large ammunition depot in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. It also said its air defences shot down two Ukrainian warplanes, an Su-25 and a MiG-29, in the eastern Luhansk region. The US defense department has denied that it provided intelligence on the locations of Russian generals on the battlefield so that Ukraine forces could kill them. However, the US did provide intelligence that helped Ukrainian forces locate and strike the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet last month, according to US officials. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. I am handing you over to my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has been speaking at a conference hosted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, and Reuters reports she said “I am confident that we will get this [sanctions] package on track – if it takes a day longer, it takes a day longer – but we are moving in the right direction.” Reuters is claiming that two sources have told it the European Commission has amended a proposal for an embargo on Russian oil to extend the period before it takes effect for Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Under the tweaked proposal, Hungary and Slovakia will continue to be able to buy Russian oil from pipelines until the end of 2024, whereas the Czech Republic could continue until June 2024, provided that it does not get oil via a pipeline from southern Europe earlier, the sources said. Ukraine celebrates 6 May as Infantry Day, and earlier Lt Gen Serhii Shaptala, who is chief of the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine, posted this message to social media: Being an infantryman is not easy, but it is honourable. That is why Ukrainians value and respect the infantry. Every day and every hour our warriors are in the thoughts, prayers and hearts of millions of people. Russian executioners in Ukraine should not be spared. We will not stop until the last occupier leaves our land. I want to thank all the infantry, men and women who defend the will of our country and defend the entire civilised world in fierce battles with the enemy. I am proud to be an infantryman. Let’s win together! Russia’s defence ministry said that its missiles destroyed a large ammunition depot in the eastern Ukrainian city of Kramatorsk. Reuters reports it also said its air defences shot down two Ukrainian warplanes, an Su-25 and a MiG-29, in the eastern Luhansk region. It was not possible to independently verify the claims. Today we are carrying an interview with Oxana Lytvynenko, as told to Weronika Strzyżyńska, in which the rights activist tells of her shock at hearing accounts of rape and murder in Ukraine: When women at the border started talking to me about rapes and murders happening inside Ukraine, I thought these were just rumours; I wouldn’t let myself believe it. I told myself that it was just people sharing scare stories or that women were just trying to rationalise their feelings of guilt about leaving their husbands and sons. Maybe my psyche was trying to defend itself. Then a woman in her 70s, who said she was from one of the occupied areas close to Irpin and Bucha, crossed the border with her daughter and great-granddaughter. The daughter, who was in her 50s, had cancer and was very sick. The medics could not believe that someone like this, with a hole in her stomach and no bandages, was so desperate to leave that she would risk travelling for so many hours with no medical support. The woman told me that her grandson served in a military brigade that had been the first to go into recently liberated areas. She said he took photos of what he had seen. She showed them to me, and it was only then I understood it was worse than I could have ever imagined. One of the photos she showed me was the hanging body of a young girl. She couldn’t have been more than 14. She said her grandson told her he was walking through the woods looking for dead bodies left by the Russians and lifted his head and saw these girls strung from the trees, all of them very young. They were naked and torn up. She said he had passed on the photos to investigators in Ukraine who were gathering evidence of war crimes. I was not ready to see something like this. Read more here: ‘I didn’t believe stories of atrocities in Ukraine. But then I saw the photos’ Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine that we have been sent over the newswires today. In the last few moments, the Mariupol local authority has posted on its Telegram channel to thank those who have been carrying out evacuations from the city. They posted: Thank you for saving our people. We hope to expand the mission and increase the scale of the evacuation. After all, tens of thousands of civilians remain in Mariupol. They all live in difficult conditions of humanitarian catastrophe. There is a total shortage of food, drinking water and medicine in the city. Therefore, the evacuation must continue. Reuters reports Andriy Yermak, the head of the presidential staff said this morning a new attempt was under way “at the moment” to evacuate civilians trapped in the Azovstal steelworks. It quotes him saying: “The next stage of rescuing our people from Azovstal is under way at the moment. Information about the results will be provided later.” This is Martin Belam in London on the live blog now. You can contact me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Rescue operations to evacuate civilians trapped in besieged Mariupol are set to resume today as Russia’s assault on the Azovstal steel works plant continues. UN humanitarian chief Martin Griffiths said on Thursday a rescue convoy was already on its way while speaking at a Ukraine donor conference in Warsaw. A convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell... and take them back to safety. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) confirmed to AFP “that a safe passage operation is ongoing” in coordination with the UN. The two organisations already worked together to evacuate some 100 civilians from the plant at the weekend. Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also confirmed the planned evacuation his latest address. More than 150 people from Azovstal and more than 300 people from Mariupol and its suburbs who were evacuated by the humanitarian corridor this week are already receiving all the help they need. Medical, document renewal, financial assistance, communication with relatives, friends and families. Currently, Russian shelling and assault of Azovstal do not stop. But civilians still need to be taken out - women, children. Many children who are still there. Just imagine this hell! And there are children! More than two months of constant shelling, bombing, constant death nearby...” The mayor of Mariupol estimates around 200 civilians remain sheltering in dismal conditions in the plant’s Soviet-era underground tunnels. Meanwhile, the US Defense Department has denied that it provided intelligence on the locations of Russian generals on the battlefield so that Ukraine forces could kill them. Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby said it was true that the United States supplies Kyiv’s forces with military intelligence “to help Ukrainians defend their country” but Ukraine makes its own decisions on whether to target a Russian leader or not. We do not provide intelligence on the location of senior military leaders on the battlefield or participate in the targeting decisions of the Ukrainian military,” Kirby said. “Ukraine combines information that we and other partners provide with the intelligence that they themselves are gathering on the battlefield. Then they make their own decisions, and they take their own actions.” The White House National Security Council slammed the New York Times report as “irresponsible.” “The United States provides battlefield intelligence to help the Ukrainians defend their country,” NSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said. “We do not provide intelligence with the intent to kill Russian generals.” The United States provided intelligence that helped Ukrainian forces locate and strike the flagship of Russia’s Black Sea fleet last month, according to US officials. The targeting help, which contributed to the eventual sinking of the Moskva is part of an ongoing classified effort by the Biden administration to provide real-time battlefield intelligence to Ukraine. Ukrainian forces, having spotted a Russian warship in the Black Sea, called their American contacts for confirmation that it was in fact the Moskva, sources familiar with the events told CNN. The US reportedly responded that it was, and provided intelligence about its location. It is not clear whether the US knew Ukraine would move to strike the ship, however, and the US was not involved in that decision, the sources said. Two senior American officials told the New York Times that Ukraine already had obtained the Moskva’s targeting data on its own, and that the United States provided only confirmation. But other officials said that the American intelligence was crucial to Ukraine’s sinking of the ship. The ship sank after it was struck by two Ukrainian cruise missiles on 14 April in what was a major blow to the Russian military. Russian forces in Mariupol have continued their ground assault on the Azovstal steel works plant for a second day, despite Russian statements claiming they would seek only to seal it off, the UK’s ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The renewed effort by Russia to secure Azovstal and complete the capture of Mariupol is likely linked to the upcoming 9 May Victory Day commemorations and Putin’s desire to have a symbolic success in Ukraine,” the report reads. This effort has come at personnel, equipment and munitions cost to Russia. Whilst Ukrainian resistance continues in Azovstal, Russian losses will continue to build and frustrate their operational plans in southern Donbas.” British prime minister Boris Johnson has lauded Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy as “truly one of the most incredible leaders of modern times” during a fundraising event in London. Johnson said the UK will “continue to intensify” efforts to assist Ukraine for as long as the help is needed and insisted Russian president Vladimir Putin will “never break” the spirit of the Ukrainian people, Downing Street said. No 10 said the aim of the event, titled ‘Brave Ukraine’, was to raise vital funds for the humanitarian response to the conflict, according to a report from PA Media. The PM said it was “a blessing for Ukraine and for the world” and “a disaster for Putin” that Zelenskiy was leading in Kyiv, describing the Ukrainian president as “truly one of the most incredible leaders of modern times”. “No matter what Putin tries to do to Ukraine’s people ... he will never break their spirit ... He will never overcome those indomitable armed forces, who have already repelled the Russian army from the gates of Kyiv, and therefore achieved the greatest feat of arms of the 21st century,” he said. That is why I’m more certain than ever that Ukraine will win. Ukraine will be free, and a sovereign Ukraine will rise again. And it’s because this struggle is so clear cut, and without any moral ambiguity that I can see, a struggle between freedom and oppression, between democracy and tyranny, independence and imperialism, light and darkness, good and evil, that is why I think it speaks so deeply to us.” “I want you to know, and I told Volodymyr this earlier on today in our conversation, we will continue to intensify this effort for as long as Ukraine wants and needs our help,” he added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague Martin Belam in London takes the reins a little later. A third evacuation is hoped for civilians currently trapped sheltering in underground tunnels beneath the Azovstal steel works plant in besieged Mariupol, though Ukrainian defenders at the site claim Russia violated its promise of a ceasefire and has prevented the evacuation of civilians. It is 8am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: A third United Nations operation is under way to evacuate civilians from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. “A convoy is proceeding to get to Azovstal by tomorrow morning hopefully to receive those civilians remaining in that bleak hell ... and take them back to safety,” the UN humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, said. The mayor of Mariupol estimates around 200 civilians remain sheltering in underground tunnels. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, described the war zone in Mariupol as appearing to be “hellscapes”. The UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross have so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steel plant area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week. A Ukrainian commander said “heavy, bloody fighting” continues at Azovstal and Russia violated its promise of a ceasefire, preventing the evacuation of civilians. Svyatoslav Palamar, a commander of the Azov regiment that is defending the site, said in a video on Telegram: “Russians violated the promise of a truce and did not allow the evacuation of civilians who continue to hide from shelling in the basement of the plant.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy also said Russian shelling and assault of Azovstal “do not stop” in his latest address. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, demanded that Ukraine order its fighters holed up in Azovstal to surrender, the Kremlin said. In a call with Israel’s prime minister, Naftali Bennett, Putin claimed Russia was still ready to provide safe passage for civilians from the plant, according to the Kremlin. The US says it shared intelligence with Ukraine about the location of the Russian missile cruiser Moskva prior to the strike that sank the warship, but the decision to attack was taken by the Ukrainians. US officials also reportedly confirmed they are providing intelligence that has helped Ukrainian forces target and kill many of the Russian generals. German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock will visit Ukraine shortly amid reports Zelenskiy has also invited the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, to visit him in Kyiv. The UK government has placed sanctions on Evraz, the multinational steelmaker part-owned by the billionaire Roman Abramovich. The company was formerly counted among Britain’s biggest companies. The Foreign Office said on Thursday that the action would “further chip away at Putin’s financial reserves and siege economy, and support Ukraine’s continued resistance”. The European Union plans to impose sanctions on Alina Kabaeva, long rumoured to be Vladimir Putin’s girlfriend, and Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church. Two sources said the EU has proposed sanctions on Kabaeva, a former Olympic gymnast whose appearance on a draft sanctions list was first reported by Bloomberg. EU countries are “almost there” in agreeing the bloc’s proposed new package of sanctions against Russia, including an oil embargo, the bloc’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Thursday. Naftali Bennett said Vladimir Putin had apologised for the Russian foreign minister’s claims that Adolf Hitler had Jewish origins. The Israeli prime minister, after a call with Putin, said he had accepted the apology and thanked the president for clarifying his position. Putin hopes to claim Mariupol as key prop in Victory Day celebrations, according to Ukrainian intelligence. “Mariupol, according to [Russia’s] plans, should become the centre of celebrations,” Ukraine’s defence intelligence agency said. “A large-scale propaganda campaign continues, during which Russians will be shown stories about the ‘joy’ of local residents from meeting with the invaders.” British prime minister Boris Johnson lauded Ukraine’s president Zelenskiy as “truly one of the most incredible leaders of modern times” during a fundraising event in London. Johnson said the UK will “continue to intensify” efforts to assist Ukraine for as long as the help is needed and insisted Russian president Vladimir Putin will “never break” the spirit of the Ukrainian people, Downing Street said. Poland and the Baltic states have inaugurated a new gas pipeline that links the north-eastern EU with the rest of the bloc, a crucial step towards reducing dependence on Russian gas. The 508 km-long (316-mile) pipeline linking Poland and Lithuania’s gas networks will eventually be able to transport around two billion cubic meters of gas per year in either direction. A $300 million yacht belonging to Russian oligarch Suleiman Kerimov has been seized by Fijian authorities at the request of the United States Department of Justice. A court in Spain ordered the provisional release of Anatoly Shariy, a Ukrainian politician and blogger who was arrested after being accused of treason in Ukraine. Shariy was arrested on Wednesday near the coastal city of Tarragona under an international arrest warrant issued by Ukraine," according to Spain’s National Court and as reported by the Associated Press.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Wives of Mariupol soldiers dispersed by police at Kyiv protest ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/06/wives-mariupol-soldiers-dispersed-police-kyiv-protest-ukraine-russia,2022-05-06T13:06:24Z,Conscription notices given to male protesters demanding evacuation as 50 people defy ban,"Wives of Ukrainian soldiers under siege in Mariupol who gathered in Kyiv to demand the evacuation of their husbands have been dispersed by police who gave army conscription notices to men who joined the protest. About 50 people had defied a government ban on Friday morning to take part in a protest on the Ukrainian capital’s independence square where they called for negotiations with the Russians over the soldiers’ fate. The UN has opened a fresh attempt to rescue the remaining 200 civilians trapped in the Russian-besieged Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, which the UN secretary general has described as a series of “hellscapes”. However, the negotiations with the Russian military have not included the fate of about 1,000 Ukrainian soldiers fighting at the sprawling works, leading to a series of protests in recent days by their relatives. Police officers ordered the women at the latest protest to leave the square as the event had not been authorised and gave conscription orders to a number of men. Yulia Girdvilis, the head of the communication department of Kyiv police, said: “There were no arrests. There were police officers at the event who explained that during the martial law mass events are not allowed and people dispersed on their own. There were military commissars present at the event who had the authority to check men’s documents. Some of the men in their 30s were taken to the draft boards [conscription offices] for further investigations.” Maria, 32, a representative of wives and relatives of the soldiers, whose own partner, Artem, 29, was killed last week during the fighting, said they were all in a state of turmoil. She said: “I am representing not only Azov regiment relatives but all of the military. We have a right to be explained. We are not against the government, they gathered there just to fight for their families’ rights. They are in a very difficult mental condition. It’s even hard to find out who’s alive who isn’t. We are just representing our families’ interests. That’s all.” She said a number of the protesters had posed for photographers but had been told by police not to show posters referring to Mariupol. “The girls asked the police could we be photographed and they said: ‘Yes just take your “save Mariupol” posters away,’” she said. “We think it’s wrong because we just want some representative from the authorities to come out and give us some explanations. What’s happening? Just let us know that they didn’t forget about our soldiers that they are doing something.” The protest had been formally cancelled by organisers after permission was withheld at the last minute, it is understood. The Ukrainian deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said people would be evacuated from Mariupol at midday local time on Friday. The UN and the Red Cross said they had so far helped nearly 500 civilians flee the steelworks area in the southern port city during two operations in the past week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
US says Ukraine will not use US-supplied rocket systems to hit Russian territory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/us-says-ukraine-will-not-use-us-supplied-rocket-systems-to-hit-russian-territory,2022-06-01T17:00:16Z,Washington says it has assurances as Moscow warns supply risks ‘third country’ being drawn into war,"Ukraine has promised Washington it will not use advanced rocket systems supplied by the US to hit targets inside Russian territory, as Moscow warned that the move risked a “third country” being drawn into the war. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said on Wednesday that after Joe Biden’s agreement to provide Ukraine with multiple-launch rocket systems, Ukraine had “given us assurances that they will not use these systems against targets on Russian territory”. The US plans to supply the M142 high mobility artillery rocket system (Himars) equipped with munitions with a range of about 50 miles, but not the more advanced rockets that can fly 185 miles. Himars is light, highly mobile and can be quickly reloaded by its crew. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking in Saudi Arabia, said the supply of the rocket launchers to Ukraine raised the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said such supplies would not encourage Ukraine’s leadership to resume stalled peace talks. “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire,” he said. “In order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever.” Shortly after the US decision was announced, the Russian defence ministry said Russia’s nuclear forces were holding drills in Ivanovo province, north-east of Moscow, the Interfax news agency reported. The expectation is that Ukraine could use the rockets in the eastern Donbas region, where they could intercept Russian artillery and take out Russian positions in towns where fighting is intense, such as Sievierodonetsk. With Ukraine facing reverses in the battle for Donbas, Kyiv has been pushing hard for allies in Europe and the US to supply long-range artillery systems in attempt to redress the balance for its outgunned and outnumbered forces in a war that has increasingly become dominated by intense artillery duels. Each launcher can carry six GPS-guided rockets, which can be reloaded in about a minute, and the system is considered more advanced than other rocket systems that Ukrainian forces currently use. Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, said Washington believed the system would meet Kyiv’s needs. “This is a defensive conflict that the Ukrainians are waging. Russian forces are on their territory,” Finer said in an interview with CNN. He said there were significant targets that Ukrainians could not reach with the weapons they had, and the rocket system would make a big difference in the conflict in the south-eastern part of the country, where Russian forces are currently focused. However, there was some scepticism among defence analysts over how significant an impact the delivery of Himars might have on the battlefield in the immediate future, pointing to questions over Ukraine’s ability to effectively deploy it. Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, wrote on Twitter: “We have an incomplete picture of the current combat status of the Ukrainian armed forces. I would be cautious when attempting to assess how quickly Ukraine would be able to integrate new platforms/weapons systems to increase combat effectiveness in a larger-scale counteroffensive. “Combined arms manoeuvre is a complex undertaking. What you don’t want is rushing undertrained brigades into combat. Knowing how to rudimentarily use and do simple repairs on a weapon system is merely the first step and does not indicate how effective units will be in actual combat.” While the weapons will close some of the gap, allowing Ukraine to hit further behind Russian lines in Ukraine – in particular allowing it to target command centres – other experts point out that using Himars effectively will rely heavily on the quality of Ukrainian battlefield intelligence. The promise of Himars represents the 11th US assistance package for Ukraine approved so far and will be the first to tap into the $40bn in security and economic assistance package recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so their supply would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two. Philip Breedlove, a retired US Air Force general who was Nato’s top commander from 2013 to 2016, said Ukraine needed multiple-launch rocket systems. “These are very important capabilities that we have not gotten them yet. And they not only need them, but they have been very vociferous in explaining they want them,” he said. “We need to get serious about supplying this army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield.” Agencies contributed to this article",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Kyiv unit patrolling the streets as law and order cracks under war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/the-kyiv-unit-patrolling-the-streets-as-law-and-order-cracks-under-war,2022-05-07T16:02:24Z,"Drunks, thieves, spies and hedgehogs all in a night’s work for the men backing up city’s overstretched police force","The call came around midnight. There was a suspicious man poking around a rundown complex of garages and workshops, police had heard a gunshot and so they wanted backup. The men of the Maidan group rolled out of the bodyshop that served as their headquarters, into a couple of vans with personalised Maidan numberplates and their own ambulance, and set off into the eerie quiet of curfew-hours Kyiv. The alarms this late were usually just for drunks so steeped in booze they had lost track of time and forgotten to go home, said “Sheriff”, who asked to go by his call sign. But the ad hoc group of paramilitaries, who work closely with a police force diminished by war – on call for the local stations and monitoring their radios – are always prepared for something more violent. Far from the frontlines, the war is straining society. There has been extraordinary solidarity across Ukraine, with ordinary people risking, and often giving, their lives to help others simply make it through the day, taking food and fuel to vulnerable and elderly people, or driving evacuation vehicles to pick up those stranded at the frontline. But a minority have taken advantage of the chaos of fighting, the flight of many neighbours into exile, and authorities distracted by an existential threat. There is constant fear of Russian agents, even far beyond the frontline. Security forces say they have arrested more than 4,000 “collaborators” and 140 people planning military sabotage since the war began. And cities are awash with guns, after the government started handing them out to almost anyone who promised to fight, during the early days of the war. “In Kyiv we are mostly seeing solidarity, but the dark side is more visible, too, now. When you have everyone cohesive, the little that is not sticks out,” Sheriff said. In over two months since the first missiles hit Kyiv, Maidan patrols have picked up opportunists on looting raids, desperate residents driven to steal as the economy collapsed, and Russian spies trying to scope potential targets, gather information or just prepare for orders to come. “We have to defend the whole country, the guys at the frontlines are the professionals, and we keep their backs,” said Sheriff, who said he tried to sign up for the military after the first bombs fell, but like many in the city was turned away from overwhelmed recruitment offices. “We want local people to see we are here, so there isn’t panic.” Four days earlier, they had picked up a Russian security service (FSB) agent using a fake Ukrainian passport, he said, because the man was acting like a bad spy from a B-list film, driving around slowly, taking photos of sensitive sites and then calling numbers in Russia. In a country filled with rumours and paranoia about saboteurs, it sounded like just another tall tale. But he flipped open his photo roll to show pictures of the man’s arrest, his fake Ukrainian passport, stamps in a concealed Russian passport showing multiple entries to parts of Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists, and even a picture of an FSB ID card, stored on the man’s phone. “At first I was sad they didn’t take me for the frontline but then I realised. It takes six months training in boot camp to fight, but it takes 18 years training to know how to catch insurgents,” said Sheriff, who spent nearly two decades in the police, finishing up as a colonel in the division fighting organised crime. “It gives you a feeling for people (acting suspiciously),” he added. People they catch, like the Russian agent, often underestimate the group because they aren’t in uniform. “He tried to threaten me that I was the criminal for stopping him. He thought I was just the usual territorial defence who just picked up a weapon. But I was in the police before, so I can eat him for breakfast (when it comes to the law).” The group was formed after the 2014 protests that ousted a pro-Russian president when he suspended plans to sign an association agreement with the European Union. They have been practising since then for a war that others never thought would come. “Everyone laughed at us ‘what the fuck are you doing, there isn’t going to be a war’.” They have their own telegram group with 20,000 subscribers so residents of their neighbourhood can reach out directly when they can’t get through to authorities. Some policemen from the area fled with their families in the first days of the war, and have not come back, the group said, making it harder to enforce order. And the new demographics of this largely working-class neighbourhood in eastern Kyiv, across the Dnieper River, have also made crime more of a risk. “Many of the people who left (when the war started) were people with money to get away, and the ability to manage. The people who stayed are the poorest, those with no work.” They include addicts and alcoholics, like the man found stumbling around the garages. He was obviously inebriated, and claimed his home was nearby and he had been drinking for hours and simply missed the curfew. The men called up a local, who confirmed the man’s wife would be waiting with a fury that would probably be more of a deterrent than any formal punishment, and sent him on his way. Sheriff’s second-in-command goes by “Kypish”, a word for intense action or combat, because he enjoys being part of the action. “My job is guarding a big shop because in the first day (of the war) it was all looted. It has electronic and construction materials,” he says. The problem is not restricted to the big city. Elsewhere, including the suburban town of Irpin, badly shelled then occupied by Russians and now infamous for atrocities, the invading troops were mocked for a rampage of theft. But in their wake, some Ukrainians took advantage of the abandoned houses. “At the beginning we were catching 10 a day, now they are very few in number. They are all local, now they are waiting for trial,” said policeman Andrei Suhdolsky. Cars that have been recovered are kept at the police station for owners to collect; for other items it can be hard to prove ownership. However, no one is under suspicion for taking food, he added, because during the occupation people were starving. Back in the empty streets of night-time Kyiv, where the curfew runs from 10pm to 5am, there are also teenagers who don’t want to be stuck at home, and some people who simply don’t care about the rules and wander out after curfew for fresh air. “There was a guy out, he said he wanted a walk. We made him do press-ups. One guy is maybe just a mistake, but if there are a lot of them, you have a problem. People here think curfew is just a joke the government made up.” After getting coffee at one of the few petrol stations that stays open all night for emergency workers, and wondering aloud why they hadn’t had more call outs, they ran into a problem that has been growing since February – hedgehogs. Not the anti-tank defences set up to stop invading forces, but the small prickly animals. They have taken advantage of the suddenly empty streets to roam more widely than they used to, forcing the animal-loving patrol car drivers to swerve wildly or slam on the brakes, if they want to avoid squashing the little curfew breakers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"‘Apocalyptic’ food prices will be disastrous for world’s poor, says Bank governor",https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/16/apocalyptic-food-prices-will-be-disastrous-for-worlds-poor-says-bank-governor,2022-05-16T16:16:12Z,Bank of England’s Andrew Bailey blames UK’s highest inflation rate for three decades on Russia-Ukraine war and Covid,"The Bank of England governor has blamed the war in Ukraine for the highest inflation in the UK for three decades and warned that “apocalyptic” food prices caused by Russia’s invasion could have a disastrous impact on the world’s poor. Defending Threadneedle Street before an announcement on Wednesday of the sharpest annual increase in four decades, Andrew Bailey told MPs that while he was unhappy about the level of price rises, 80% of the inflation target overshoot was caused by factors outside the Bank’s control. Bailey said the Bank could not have been expected to predict a war in Ukraine, which he warned would have consequences for the UK and the developing world. Countries such as Egypt and Tunisia rely heavily on exports of Ukraine’s wheat and cooking oil, and the governor said his concerns about food supplies had been heightened after speaking to Kyiv’s finance minister at last month’s IMF meeting in Washington. “He said he was optimistic about crop planting, but at the moment there was no way of shipping the food out, and it’s getting worse,” Bailey said. “That’s not just a major worry for this country, but a worry for the developing world. I’m sorry for being apocalyptic, but it is a worry.” Amid growing concern about Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, the head of the CBI, Tony Danker, called on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to offer immediate help to those struggling to feed themselves at a time of rising food and energy prices. The director-general of the employers’ organisation said there was a “moral imperative” on the government to act. Official figures due out on Wednesday are expected to show the annual inflation rate climbing above 9%, with the Bank of England expecting the figure to climb above 10% when the energy price cap is raised further in October. Asked if the Bank could have prevented inflation from soaring by raising interest rates sooner, Bailey told the Treasury select committee: “I don’t think we could. I don’t think we could foresee a war in Ukraine. “Another factor that we’re dealing with at the moment is a further leg of Covid, which is affecting China. We have seen a series of supply shocks coming one after another, and that’s unprecedented.” The Bank’s nine-strong monetary policy committee has raised interest rates at its last four meetings after it doubled its forecast for the peak in inflation this year from 5% to 10%. “I don’t feel at all happy and it’s a bad situation to be in,” the governor said after MPs asked him to explain why the Bank had waited until December before acting. In the wake of reports at the weekend that unnamed cabinet ministers had questioned whether the Bank should remain independent, Bailey said: “This is the biggest test of the monetary policy framework in 25 years. There is no question about that.” The governor reiterated the call for pay restraint that he made in February, urging the best-paid to set an example to workers earning less. “I do think people, particularly people who are on higher earnings, should think and reflect on asking for high wage increases,” he said. “It’s a societal question. But I am not preaching about this. It’s not for me to go around telling people what to do. “In that sense, I know I may have been interpreted as doing that, but I wasn’t. What I was saying is that maybe people should reflect on it, particularly people in that situation.” Paul Nowak, deputy general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said: “It is unbelievable that the Bank of England has repeated its calls for workers to take a wage hit – while saying virtually nothing about soaring profits at the likes of BP and Shell. The last thing working people need right now – in the middle of the worst living standards crisis in generations – is to have their wages held down.” Asked about the future dangers to the cost of living, Bailey said there could be prolonged supply-chain bottlenecks as a result of disruption in China or higher energy prices if Russia decided to cut off gas supplies. However, he said the Bank could not have been expected to foresee recent events. “I do see comments based on hindsight, but we have to take [monetary policy] decisions based on the facts and evidence at the time.” His comments followed an announcement by Great Britain’s energy regulator, Ofgem, that it was planning to make changes to its price cap four times a year, as opposed to twice at present. The regulator on Monday published a consultation on proposals to introduce new reviews of the price cap in January and July, adding to existing changes in April and October, in an attempt to respond more quickly to volatile markets. Meanwhile, the RAC revealed that the average price of diesel at forecourts had hit a record of just over £1.80 a litre, with experts warning of further rises if EU plans to ban Russian oil imports go ahead.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Devil’s advocate? Russian soldier’s Ukrainian lawyer defends role on eve of verdict,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/devils-advocate-russian-soldiers-ukrainian-lawyer-viktor-ovsyannikov-defends-role-on-eve-of-verdict,2022-05-22T15:12:44Z,Viktor Ovsyannikov speaks out on his defence of a 21-year-old tank commander who shot and killed an unarmed civilian,"Defending a Russian soldier accused of a war crime in Ukraine is no easy task, which is why some people have described Viktor Ovsyannikov as “the devil’s advocate”. But the 43-year-old Ukrainian is unrepentant. “First of all, I am defending a person, not a crime,” Ovsyannikov said on Sunday on the eve of the verdict in the trial of the 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin, who has already pleaded guilty to killing an unarmed civilian in late February. “I’m trying to prove that my defendant’s actions were misqualified. It’s up to judges to decide. I just do my job.” “My family, friends and colleagues support me,” Ovsyannikov added. “They know someone has to do it. But there are other people who ‘invited’ me to go to Moscow or Donbas [the area in eastern Ukraine claimed by Russia-backed separatists].” Prosecutors were astonished on Friday when Ovsyannikov asked judges in the courtroom in Kyiv to acquit Shishimarin despite his guilty plea, on the grounds that he had executed an order. The Ukrainian prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the instruction to open fire could not be considered a military order and therefore did not protect Shishimarin from responsibility. Ukraine has made seeking justice for atrocities committed by Russian troops a priority and national prosecutors are risking their lives to collect evidence of war crimes even in areas still threatened by enemy forces or laced with mines. Shishimarin comes from Ust Illyinsk, in the south-east Irkutsk region of Russia, and was a commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division on 28 February, the day that 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died in Chupakhivka village. Prosecutors say a group of Russian soldiers shot at a civilian vehicle after their convoy came under attack from Ukrainian forces, then stole the car and drove it away. They later came across the unarmed victim, who was talking on his phone a few dozen metres from his home. One of the men in the car told Shishimarin “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. He opened fire out of the car window and shot down Shelipov. This is not Ovsyannikov’s first controversial trial. In 2014 he defended the Russia-backed former president Viktor Yanukovych, who was eventually found guilty of high treason and sentenced in absentia to 13 years in prison over attempts to quash a pro-western uprising. Ovsyannikov argues that ever since he accepted the task of defending Shishimarin, people have asked him the same question: “How can you defend a war criminal?” “And I am so tired of explaining that, in Ukraine, only a court of law can recognise one as a criminal. And, as far as I know, there is no verdict for my defendant at the moment.” The trial is unprecedented in Ukraine, where authorities are moving fast and trying to carry out justice while conflict is ongoing. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases for war crimes trials. Monday’s verdict is being seen as a public test of the independence of Ukraine’s judicial system. “Of course, it is quite an important test and there is even stronger pressure from society on the judges to find him guilty,” said Ovsyannikov. “My first impression of Shishimarin was of an ordinary person, just like you or me,” he said. “My second impression, when I started to work with him, is that he began to understand what had done. The only thing he desires now is to go back home. I am under this impression that he perceives this as some kind of a dream.” “Sometimes,” he added, “I feel pity for him.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2022 to change the spelling of Vadim Shishimarin to put into Guardian style.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Greed and fear’: How BP and Shell oil profit is boosted by own traders ,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/12/trading-in-turbulent-market-helps-bp-and-shell-secure-record-profits,2022-05-12T11:03:04Z,<strong>Analysis: </strong>Turmoil resulting from pandemic and Ukraine war create ideal conditions for speculators,"The British oil giants BP and Shell reported huge quarterly profits this month, reigniting calls for a windfall tax to ease the burden of bills on struggling families. Tesco’s chairman, John Allan, this week argued that there was an “overwhelming case” for a one-off levy on North Sea extractors. While the focus was on their oil production businesses, both “supermajors” have benefited from a boom in trading revenues. BP and Shell do not simply produce and sell oil, they employ thousands of traders whose job it is to buy and sell oil produced by other companies. They profit from speculating on swings in the oil price, and the choppier the market, the higher the potential earnings. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have caused markets to whipsaw, creating ideal conditions for those betting on price movements. Petrol prices at the pumps are at record highs, up 16% this year on top of a 50% rise in 2021. Wholesale gas prices are up nearly 400% since the invasion of Ukraine. The volatility has made hydrocarbons popular with institutions and bedroom day traders alike. More than 100m barrels a day of oil and other petroleum products are traded. For many years oil trading was a small offshoot of the bulging multinationals but now it represents a vital profit engine, the well-groomed cousin of the dirty, hard-hatted world of riggers and drillers. In London, oil traders typically earn about £102,000 a year but can snare large bonuses based on their performance. Last year, Vitol’s Top 350 staff shared a £2.1bn bonus pool – equivalent to £6m a person. Although the sector is dominated by commodities specialists Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore, extractors are a huge presence. But there is no transparency. BP and Shell do not split out the numbers for their trading divisions, meaning those looking for answers have to make do with estimates. In its bumper first-quarter results, BP trumpeted “exceptional” trading, outstripping last year. The firm employs about 3,000 people across its vast trading floors in London, Houston, Chicago and Singapore. Analysts at Alliance Bernstein estimate that BP notched up $1.3bn in gas trading profits between the start of the year and the end of March, and $1.1bn for liquids trading – a total of $2.3bn, just over a third of its $6.2bn in profits in the first quarter. Shell’s trading profits are harder to estimate, but at the division containing its trading business, which also includes exploration and extraction, adjusted earnings jumped to $6.3bn in the first quarter from $3.4bn in the same period a year earlier. Shell makes as much as $4bn a year from trading oil and gas, while BP notches up $2bn to $3bn, Bloomberg reported last year, citing sources close to the companies. Sinead Gorman, chief financial officer of Shell, said: “Our trading business has done very well – it of course has the benefit of being linked very strongly to our underlying assets.” The specialists are expected to do well this year. Glencore raked in $3.7bn from its trading arm last year and was on course to easily beat its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn this year. It would be the third consecutive year the FTSE 100 firm has beaten forecasts, on the kind of form which earned it the nickname “The Millionaire Factory” before its float which enriched an army of executives a decade ago. Vitol, the world’s biggest independent oil trader, made a record net profit of just over $4bn last year, while rivals Trafigura, Mercuria and Guvnor also boasted of bumper earnings. It’s a sector built around financial instruments. Oil companies can agree immediate “spot” prices or “futures” contracts, in which set prices for set amounts of certain oil are agreed upon in advance. Companies will often lock in cheap oil and then hedge against the price heading in the other direction. Traders do not necessarily need to take delivery of the physical oil under a futures contract, and can settle in cash if it is no longer needed. In fact, it is estimated about 13 times the physical amount of oil is traded through purely financial contracts. This means the price paid at the pump in Britain is as much to do with trading conducted on exchanges in the US as the amount of oil arriving into ports. Another common set of instruments are “call” and “put” options, which allow traders to bet on making a profit if prices exceed or fall below a certain price. “You may take a view on the difference in price between Russia and non-Russian oil. Then you speculate that, if sanctions come in, the Russian oil will fall in value and others will rise – so you can trade the difference,” says Bill*, who ran a joint venture with one of the world’s biggest commodities traders. “We are driven by greed and fear. If something is going up in price, knowing when the right time to sell is crucial, you need to recognise that,” he adds. But it’s a profession that comes with significant risk. In the early 2000s, Bill was encouraged to travel down from the Port of Grimsby to London to meet a group of US executives making waves in the energy market. “I walked through a huge floor of sharp-suited traders in Canary Wharf. They explained how they were trading the markets and, at the end of the meeting, I thought: ‘Either I’m thick or these guys are charlatans,’” he recounts. The business was Enron. It would soon implode in one of the biggest accounting scandals in corporate history. Enron’s collapse has become a cautionary tale about the dangers of arrogant management and complex accounting. It has also fed into the image of an industry with independent players willing to take the risky – but potentially rewarding – bets made by Wall Street investment bankers. This was underscored when the little-known outfit Vega Capital made a reported £400m on the collapse in the oil price in 2020. The 12 traders, dubbed “the Essex boys”, have since been accused in US courts of manipulating markets and violating antitrust laws. They have moved to have the lawsuit thrown out. In The World For Sale: Money, Power, and the Traders Who Barter the Earth’s Resources, written by two Bloomberg energy specialists, BP sources claim that the company made $150m to $200m in a single trade in 2016. A former chief executive, Bob Dudley, secretly sanctioned the decision made by a management team – because the trade was too large for an individual to be held responsible – to bet Brent crude would finally improve after a sustained fall. It proved a watershed moment for BP’s traders, who profited as oil bounced back. Without a swift end to the war, 2022 could prove equally seismic for traders. *name has been changed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Do whatever it takes’: Beijing urged to act as China’s economy falters,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/do-whatever-it-takes-beijing-urged-to-act-as-china-economy-falters,2022-05-20T11:25:51Z,"Attempts to boost flagging GDP growth hindered by Covid lockdowns, Ukraine war and Sino-US tensions","At a recent online gathering of top Chinese economists, a palpable sense of urgency filled the virtual meeting room. In recent weeks, a slew of reports by Chinese and foreign economists pointed to a deteriorating economy. Outside the country, talk of China being the engine of global economic growth no longer convinces. During the meeting Huang Yiping, a Peking University professor and a former central bank adviser, urged Beijing to “do whatever it takes to save the economy”. Huang was paraphrasing a line from the height of the European debt crises more than a decade ago, when the European Central Bank’s then president, Mario Draghi, said it was ready to “do whatever it takes to preserve the euro”. Huang suggested: “Cashflow problems have shown up for many enterprises and households. More direct support is needed for affected companies and people.” His remarks have resonated with locked-down social media users after reports of the meeting were released on Sunday. “[He’s] a courageous Chinese intellectual,” one wrote on WeChat. China’s economy is struggling. This week, official data showed a sharp fall in economic activity in the past month, as lockdowns confined hundreds of millions of consumers to their homes and hit supply chains. Retail sales in April shrank more than 11% from a year earlier – the biggest contraction since March 2020, shortly after the Covid outbreak. In March, the premier, Li Keqiang, pledged to grow China’s GDP this year at “around 5.5%” – the lowest official target in three decades. However, Fitch ratings earlier this month cut China’s 2022 forecast GDP growth further, to 4.3% from 4.8%. Meanwhile, according to state media, fiscal revenues plunged last month across Chinese cities as a result of Covid lockdown measures. On Friday, the People’s Bank of China cut a key mortgage interest rate from 4.6% to 4.45% – a record amount – to support the property sector by reducing home loan costs across the country. However, there are growing calls for it to do more. ‘There are just not enough jobs’ Winnie Zhang, a product design senior at Shanghai’s Jian Qiao University, is one of the millions of young Chinese feeling the pinch of the current economic situation. She is about to graduate from the university but is struggling to find work. “Some companies have stopped sending out offers, or they are only having one round of interviews,” she said. Zhang said a lot of companies that have received applications haven’t responded, and many said explicitly that they were not looking for employees to work remotely. “I think graduates this year would think they have more pressure in job hunting compared with graduates in 2017 and 2016.” A record 10.76 million graduates are expected to enter the job market this year, according to official figures – 1.67 million more than in 2021, which itself was a record. Recent surveys on postgraduate employment found economic prospects declining, with available jobs falling to 0.88 a student in the fourth quarter of 2021. Average monthly salaries in 2022 are down about 12% from 2021. Recent stringent lockdown measures in major cities, such as Shanghai, have made things worse. In April, according to China’s official data, the unemployment rate rose to 6.1% – the highest level since February 2020. Nancy Qian, an economics professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, said the real unemployment situation may actually be worse because of the different ways Chinese statistics count joblessness. “There are just not enough jobs to start with, as the economy began to slow a few years ago,” Qian said. “This is really binding China now and there’s no quick fix. And to create more jobs, Beijing has to open up its markets. But Covid, Ukraine as well as US-China geopolitical tensions are making it less likely in the short term.” A pair of contradictions Chinese commentaries this month have frequently raised the need for stability – not only social and political stability but primarily economic stability. China’s premier, who for a long time was thought by analysts to be out of favour with President Xi Jinping, has become more vocal about the need to grow the economy. Last month, Li – who is to step down upon finishing his second term in March 2023 – spoke openly during a tour of Jiangxi in eastern China of his support for entrepreneurs, many of whom have in the last year expressed dismay amid Xi’s various crackdowns on the private sector. “We support entrepreneurs and innovation,” Li told the crowd, adding he was particularly keen to see young people start their own businesses. The premier, a longtime technocrat with a law degree and a doctorate in economics from Peking University, has had big ambitions to transform the country’s debt-driven economy, according to interviews with people familiar with him. However, they said it has been difficult for him to achieve much, given the current mood music, where politics seems to take a front seat. Optimists see signs that, with internal as well as external pressures, efforts to boost market confidence is more preferred within the ruling Communist party – at least for now. “It seems China is back in its classic conundrum: political priorities v economic priorities,” Qian said. “Every country faces that trade-off but in China this pair of contradictions has been salient ever since the founding of the People’s Republic in 1949.” She added: “In the short-term, Beijing’s prioritisation of ideology – or ‘politics in command’ – will continue to make headlines. But in the long run, the current economic situation and social dynamics may be forcing party elites to refocus on ‘economy in command’.” However, Prof Shaun Breslin of Warwick University, the author of the book China Risen?, argued the party’s political instinct has always been about the short-term logic of social – and therefore political – stability. “And it always seems to trump longer-term arguments about the wisdom of fundamental economic restructuring,” he said. On Tuesday, the vice-premier Liu He and the fourth highest-ranking party member Wang Yang met senior tech entrepreneurs at a symposium to reaffirm their support for the private sector as well as tech IPOs at home and abroad. But the two senior leaders also reminded the companies of the need to align with government goals. “The danger is that after rounds of crackdowns on private businesses [in the past two years], would the entrepreneurs still be willing to play ball, or would they be wary that any new freedoms given now might simply be taken away again in the future?” Breslin said. At the meeting of economists where Huang spoke, there was no explicit criticism of the government’s approach to Covid. Speakers talked of how the government should boost production while controlling outbreaks. Then, mid-speech, Prof Yu Yongding, a respected government adviser who had been staying at home for the past fortnight, was reminded to do another Covid test. “I’ve done nucleic acid tests for more than 10 days non-stop. Here’s another pop-up notification. I’ll have to negotiate with them. I’m sorry to end my talk like this,” he told the audience, who burst into laughter.

Alexander Lebedev severs links with Independent after Canada sanctions,https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/may/24/alexander-lebedev-quits-independent-role-after-canada-sanctions,2022-05-24T17:54:57Z,"Russian oligarch, who bought British news outlet for £1 in 2010, ‘directly enabled’ Putin’s war, says Canada","The Russian oligarch Alexander Lebedev has quit his role at a company connected to the Independent, shortly after being placed under economic sanctions by Canada for “directly enabling” the Russian war in Ukraine. It means the former KGB agent now has no formal link to the British news outlet. His departure may have had the effect of protecting the Independent from any issues that might have arisen out of the sanctions. Canada last week named Lebedev on a list of 14 prominent people who had “directly enabled Vladimir Putin’s senseless war in Ukraine and bear responsibility for the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine”. Canadian individuals and businesses are now banned from conducting business with him and connected entities. The 62-year-old Russian bought the Independent for £1 in 2010, having previously taken control of London’s Evening Standard for the same sum the previous year. He later transferred control of the publications to his son Evgeny – a friend of Boris Johnson who was recently given a seat in the House of Lords by the prime minister, despite concerns from the security services. The two news outlets have since racked up huge losses, while giving the Lebedevs a degree of influence in British society, although the Independent has returned a profit in recent years. Corporate filings show Alexander Lebedev stepped down as a director of Independent Print Ltd on Sunday, the day after it was publicly reported that he was on the Canadian sanctions list. The company, which published the print edition of the Independent until 2016, is owned by Evgeny, who is also an owner of the Independent and Evening Standard. A spokesperson for the newspapers played down the importance of the elder Lebedev’s resignation from the IPL board of directors, saying he had not been actively involved in the news outlets since 2016. They said: “Alexander Lebedev has no role, commercial or otherwise, in the running of either the Independent or the Evening Standard.” Alexander Lebedev rose to prominence as a banker in the 1990s in Russia before funding the opposition Novaya Gazeta outlet. His wife, Elena Perminova, 35, has continued to post updates on her widely followed Instagram account about fashion launches, with recent pictures showing the family on a holiday in Istanbul. The decision to put Alexander Lebedev on the sanctions list has renewed scrutiny of the prime minister’s decision to award a peerage to his 42-year-old son. The government has so far failed to comply with a House of Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, arguing this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated to the upper house of parliament and could degenerate into “political point-scoring”. The Cabinet Office minister, Michael Ellis, told parliament he did not believe it was in the public interest to release the correspondence relating to the decision, adding: “Lord Lebedev is a man of good standing.” The ownership of the Independent and Evening Standard has long been a source of intrigue. Since taking control of the outlets from his father, Evgeny Lebedev has sold minority stakes in them to a bank with close connections to the Saudi Arabian state. • This article was amended on 27 May 2022. An earlier version implied that Alexander Lebedev quit a “role” connected to the current publisher of the Independent newspaper, Independent Digital News and Media Limited. In fact, Alexander Lebedev resigned as a director of Independent Print Limited, which had been the publisher of the print edition of the newspaper until 2016. Text was also added to reflect that the Independent has returned a profit in recent years.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia uses Orwellian propaganda news vans in Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/russia-uses-orwellian-propaganda-news-vans-in-mariupol,2022-05-26T14:43:13Z,Large TVs play Russian state news in support of invasion in war-torn city still lacking electricity and water,"Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Videos published by the Russian ministry of emergency situations showed the vans, which it called “mobile information complexes”, playing state TV news segments and political chat shows where pundits support the invasion to locals in the ruined city that still lacks electricity and running water. The Orwellian turn comes as much of Mariupol was destroyed in an artillery bombardment that left thousands dead. One of the vans was deployed near the ruins of the Mariupol drama theatre, where hundreds were killed in an airstrike in March. Several of the trucks now patrol the city, mainly playing Russian television news segments. “The people of Mariupol have been held in a virtual informational vacuum for three months due to the lack of electricity,” wrote the emergencies ministry in a statement. The mobile screens have reportedly been deployed to places where Mariupol residents are receiving humanitarian aid, Russian documents, and at points in the city where drinking water is available. “The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”. “The truth and the propaganda,” wrote Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, posting a video of the trucks superimposed over images of the ruins of the city. This is “the Russian world”, he added. The effort to install Russian propaganda in the ruined city is part of a larger effort at pacifying and integrating captured cities like Mariupol despite earlier assurances by Vladimir Putin that Russia did not seek to occupy new territory in Ukraine. Putin on Wednesday signed a law that would fast-track applications for citizenship from Mariupol, as well as the Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that are partly under government control. The Kremlin decision has been decried as “passportisation”, an attempt to annex the territories by filling them with de facto Russian citizens. Senior Kremlin officials have already promised to remain in southern Ukraine “for ever”. “The simplified system will allow all of us to clearly see that Russia is here not just for a long time but for ever,” the Moscow-appointed deputy leader of the occupied Kherson region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russia’s RIA Novosti state news agency. “The illegal issuing of passports … is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law,” the Ukrainian foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The Russian-controlled administration in Kherson also announced that it would begin issuing salaries in roubles on Thursday, effectively adopting Russia’s currency as part of the creeping annexation of southern Ukrainian territories. Local authorities installed by Russia have also said they may formally request annexation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
IMF chief warns of multiple inflationary shocks amid market jitters,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/19/imf-chief-warns-of-multiple-inflationary-shocks-amid-market-jitters,2022-05-19T15:39:10Z,Kristalina Georgieva cites Russia’s war in Ukraine and cost pressures caused by China’s zero-Covid policies,"Global finance leaders should prepare for multiple inflationary shocks, the head of the International Monetary Fund has warned, as fears of a global economic downturn continue to hit markets around the world. The IMF’s managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said it is becoming harder for central banks to bring down inflation without causing recessions. Speaking at the sidelines of a meeting of G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs in Germany, Georgieva cited mounting pressures on energy and food prices from Russia’s war in Ukraine, supply chain disruption and cost pressures caused by China’s zero-Covid policies. “I think what we need to start getting more comfortable with is, that may not be the last shock,” Georgieva said, adding that the outbreak of the Omicron coronavirus variant late last year had shown that inflation would not be a “transitory” one time shock. Inflation has risen to its highest level in about 40 years in both the UK and the US this year, and is the highest it’s been in the eurozone since statistics began in 1997. Investors fear that central banks risk a “hard landing”, pushing economies into recession, as they raise interest rates to bring inflation down towards target. London’s stock market tumbled into the red on Thursday, with the FTSE 100 index closed down 135 points or 1.8% at 7,302. The pan-European Stoxx 600 index was down 1.3% with personal care companies, food and beverage companies, tech stocks and retailers all weakening. Wall Street opened lower, a day after its worst selloff in nearly two years, as major retailers reported that rising inflation was hitting consumer spending and eating into their profit margins. US department store chain Kohl’s slashed its profit and sales outlook, echoing Target and Walmart earlier this week. US jobless claims rose for the third week in a row, with 218,000 Americans seeking unemployment support last week. A survey of manufacturers in the Philadelphia region showed that growth almost stalled this month, as rising costs hit factories. “The reality is no matter which way your turn, warnings signs are flashing,” said Fiona Cincotta, senior financial markets analyst at City Index. Inflation hit confidence at UK factories too, where investment plans remained weak, according to the latest industrial trends reports from business body the CBI. The number of manufacturers planning to lift their own prices remained near a record high. The Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell, has indicated that the US central bank will raise interest rates by 50 basis points in June and July, in its determination to pull US inflation down from 8.3% in April. That has driven up fears of a global slowdown. Joost van Leenders, senior investment strategist at wealth manager Van Lanschot Kempen, cautioned that the Fed wasn’t usually able to achieve a soft landing. “A recession is usually necessary to quash inflation. There is a slightly greater chance of a soft landing though if there are no major imbalances in the economy, especially if families and businesses don’t hold finance deficits. And, as it happens, that’s exactly the situation we’re in at the moment. A positive outcome is therefore possible, although the Fed has its work cut out,” Van Leenders said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Enemy tongue: eastern Ukrainians reject their Russian birth language,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/04/enemy-tongue-eastern-ukrainians-reject-their-russian-birth-language,2022-06-04T13:08:28Z,"In towns near Russia’s border, Moscow’s influence was strong and Ukrainian was rarely spoken. The war has changed that","Gamlet Zinkivskyi grew up speaking Russian in the city of Kharkiv, just like his parents. But when Vladimir Putin launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, it was the final push for him to switch fully to Ukrainian. “Unfortunately, I grew up speaking Russian, but it’s not pleasant to speak the same language as the army that is destroying whole areas of our country,” said Zinkivskyi, a 35-year-old street artist widely known to Kharkiv residents, who usually refer to him by his first name. The switch of language is part of a broader journey towards a more pronounced Ukrainian identity for Zinkivskyi, something shared by many in the largely Russian-speaking areas of east and south Ukraine. It is a process which has become more pronounced in the past three months, but it has been brewing for some years. As a young artist, Zinkivskyi had a longstanding dream: an exhibition in Moscow. Kharkiv is just a few dozen miles from the border with Russia and has long been almost entirely Russian-speaking. Culturally, Moscow felt like the centre of the universe. But when Zinkivskyi finally made it to a gallery there in 2012, he was horrified. “They were obnoxious and patronising about Kharkiv and Ukraine, and frankly I thought: fuck them,” he said. He returned to Kharkiv and became more focused on the Ukrainian art scene. After the annexation of Crimea, in 2014, Zinkivskyi started trying to speak some Ukrainian with a few friends. Now he has fully switched, and for the first time is also introducing political and patriotic themes into his art. The language issue is something that comes up again and again in Kharkiv. Oleksandra Panchenko, a 22-year-old interior designer, said that since 2014 she had been trying hard to improve her Ukrainian, but conceded that she still often speaks Russian with friends. However, she is adamant that by the time she has children, she will be fluent enough to speak only Ukrainian at home. “I grew up in a Russian-language family, my kids will grow up in a Ukrainian-language family,” she said. Back in 2014, there were separatist rumblings in Kharkiv, with some people looking to the swift annexation of Crimea and wondering if all of eastern Ukraine might not be better off inside Russia. But eight years of observing the miserable conditions in the Russian proxy states of Donetsk and Luhansk dampened those feelings, and Russia’s invasion has almost entirely extinguished them. Panchenko, who has painted her nails blue and yellow and describes herself as a staunch patriot, made a guess at the political allegiances of Kharkiv residents before the war, based on her broad circle of acquaintances. About 10% of the city used to be what are disparagingly known as vatniki – aggressively pro-Russian – she said. She described 30% as being like her, “Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine”, and 50% were “neutral – they felt Ukrainian but not that strongly”. Russia’s war on Ukraine has pushed people in this neutral category more firmly into the patriotic camp, creating a much broader and more passionate pro-Ukrainian base than ever existed previously, particularly in the east of the country. “There were a lot of neutral people here, but as soon as it came to the war, a lot of them decided to fight,” said Vsevolod Kozhemyako, a businessman who runs an agricultural company and once featured on the Forbes list of the 100 richest Ukrainians. Kozhemyako was skiing in Europe when the war began, and left his family to return to Ukraine and set up a volunteer battalion. His unit has been based close to the frontline outside Kharkiv, in settlements that have come under relentless Russian fire. Three out of four of Kozhemyako’s grandparents were Russian, and during the Soviet era his passport listed his nationality as Russian. However, he said that ever since the Orange Revolution of 2004 he had been a strong Ukrainian patriot and rejected the influence of Russia in Ukraine. “Russians and Ukrainians are absolutely different. I am Russian-speaking, I think in Russian and I have three-quarter Russian blood, but the part of Ukrainian blood in me made its mark,” he said in an interview in Kharkiv city centre, where he now allows himself the occasional day away from his unit. Kozhemyako and Zinkivskyi are old acquaintances, and when the artist told the businessman he wanted to sign up, Kozhemyako welcomed him to the battalion, but told him he should fight with a paintbrush and not a gun. Since then, Zinkivskyi has been busy painting slogans on buildings damaged by Russian missiles. He also crossed out the street signs on Pushkin Street and renamed it English Street, which he says is recognition of British military support for Ukraine. “Gamlet is very patriotic and his works are quite philosophical,” said Kozhemyako. “They make people think in the direction of a new Ukraine. This is very important, especially now.” The geographical and cultural variations inside Ukraine were one of the reasons why Putin and other Russian leaders tried to claim the country was an artificial construct. Instead, they now find their bloody invasion has done more than anything to bring the different parts of Ukraine together under a common identity, in opposition to Moscow. The Russian invasion has simultaneously given those who might be neutral in their allegiances a stark choice about what kind of country they want to identify with, and provided a rallying point that allows for a broad and inclusive idea of what it means to be a Ukrainian patriot. In the early days of the war, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, passed a decree banning the activities of a number of pro-Russian parties, and the country’s most notorious pro-Russian politician, Viktor Medvedchuk, was arrested. Medvedchuk, whose daughter is Putin’s goddaughter, has long been seen as Putin’s man in Kyiv. But even some of his close associates have rebranded themselves as patriots in the wake of the invasion. Yuriy Zagorodny, a member of parliament, had been at Medvedchuk’s side since they both worked in the administration of former president Leonid Kuchma in the early 2000s. However, he said, he made a decision in the early days of the war that his relationship with Medvedchuk was over. “Ukraine is my homeland, Russia is an aggressor and Putin is the main criminal of the 21st century,” he said in an interview in Kyiv, employing dramatically different rhetoric to what he had used during a previous interview in mid-February. Zagorodny said he had joined the territorial defence unit in his home town, south of Kyiv, in the first days of the war. He had spent some nights on a checkpoint and other days overseeing the construction of trenches. He said he had spent hours checking the documents of drivers of passing cars; then when he had to travel to Kyiv for parliamentary sittings, he was stopped at another checkpoint, where the men pulled him out of the car and subjected him to verbal abuse when they saw he was an MP from Medvedchuk’s party. He assured the men he was a firm patriot. “I do have a feeling of guilt, but what we wanted was peaceful coexistence between the countries. Of course, now, that’s all over,” said Zagorodny. “Changing shoes in mid-air” is the Ukrainian expression for this kind of rapid transformation in views to fit in with the prevailing climate, but for all that there may be cynical self-preservation at work, there is also a sense that people have had to make a choice: either come down on the side of a Ukraine that is fighting for the right to exist, or on that of a Russia that launches missiles and bombs on sleeping cities, and where freedom of expression is no longer legal. For many, it is an easy choice, and by launching the attack on Ukraine in the way he did, Putin has deprived Russia of many of its natural supporters in the country. “My 11-year old nephew talks about ‘Putler’ – a mix of Putin and Hitler. He will spend his whole life hating Russia, and his children will too. Maybe in several generations that will change, but not sooner than that,” said Zagorodny. In the port of Odesa, the mayor, Hennadiy Trukhanov, widely seen as pro-Russian, released an angry video in the early days of the war in response to the Kremlin’s claims that it was defending Russian speakers in the country. “Who the fuck are you planning to defend here?” he asked. In the central city of Kryvyi Rih, the mayor, Oleksandr Vilkul, previously seen as pro-Russian, has also rebranded himself as a patriot and taken up defence of the city. As well as strengthening the sense of Ukrainian identity among politicians and the general population in the south and east of the country, the war has also helped increase respect for these areas in the patriotic strongholds of western and central Ukraine, where some doubted the loyalty of parts of the east, particularly after 2014. Kozhemyako said any doubts about these regions should now be considered settled: “A lot of people in western Ukraine saw how Kharkiv fights,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia-Ukraine war: UN calls for end to school strikes after nearly 100 child deaths in April; EU to consider Ukraine’s membership – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/12/russia-ukraine-war-news-live-updates-latest-putin-zelenskiy-finland-nato-bid,2022-05-12T23:51:14Z,"UN verifies nearly 100 child killings but says figure likely higher; Ukraine’s EU application to be assessed in June, says France","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine and returning in a few hours to bring you all the latest developments. In the meantime, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things stand as the time approaches 3am in Kyiv. A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since the invasion began when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday. Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, is accused of shooting dead an unarmed man who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone in the village of Chupakhivka, Sumy, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. The Russian foreign ministry in Moscow said it would have to take “military-technical” steps if Helsinki applied for Nato accession, after Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said the country must apply to join the military alliance “without delay”. Neighbouring Sweden is expected to follow suit in the coming days. Republican senator Rand Paul has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill to Ukraine in the US Senate. Paul demanded changes to the legislation that would include implementing a special inspector general to oversee how the aid is spent. Michael Carpenter, the US ambassador to the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that “at least several thousand Ukrainians” have been sent to so-called “filtration centres” in Russia where they are subject to “brutal interrogations”. Tens of thousands more had been evacuated to Russia or Russia-controlled territory. Carpenter said that one survivor said “everyone was afraid to be taken to Donetsk”, where they could be the victim of “further investigation or murder”. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, are being discussed at a three-day meeting of G7 foreign and agriculture ministers in Germany. Before the war, most of the food produced by Ukraine – enough to feed 400 million people – was exported through the country’s seven Black Sea ports. Ukraine said it had damaged and set on fire a Russian navy logistics ship in the Black Sea. The Vsevolod Bobrov vessel was near Snake Island, said Serhiy Bratchuk, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine. The Guardian could not independently verify the details. Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” were ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We work step by step,’” he said. “We will exchange 38, then we will move on.” The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia’s invasion has exceeded 6 million, the UN’s refugee agency said. A further 8 million people have been forced to flee their homes and are displaced inside Ukraine, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Nearly 100 children were killed in Ukraine during the month of April alone, but actual figures could be significantly higher, the United Nations children’s fund said. Unicef’s deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been “damaged or destroyed” as of last week. European Union leaders plan to assess Ukraine’s membership next month, according to the French foreign ministry. Ukraine’s application to become an EU member was being examined by the European Commission and would be “discussed at heads of state and government level at the European Council in the month of June”, a spokesperson for the ministry said. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland tomorrow, a day after Finnish leaders said they would apply to join Nato, according to reports. Key Finnish politicians have been warned that Russia could halt its gas supplies on Friday, the local newspaper Iltalehti cited unnamed sources as saying. The UN’s human rights council has passed a resolution to investigate alleged abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control, with a view to holding those responsible to account. The resolution passed by a strong majority, with 33 members voting in favour and two – China and Eritrea – against. There were 12 abstentions. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said 1,000 bodies had been recovered in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in recent weeks. Many of the violations it is verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes, she said. The UK government has declined a Commons instruction to release information about the decision to make Evgeny Lebedev a peer, saying this would undermine the confidentiality of those nominated and could degenerate into “political point-scoring”, the Guardian’s political correspondent Peter Walker reports. Labour called the decision “a cover-up” and promised more action over what it called a contempt of parliament. The announcement said information had instead been provided to parliament’s intelligence and security committee (ISC). This prompted an immediate rebuff from the ISC, which said its request for details about Lebedev was separate and should have remained classified. In March a humble address motion tabled by Labour was passed by the Commons amid a threatened Tory rebellion, directing ministers to release information about the elevation of the Russian-born businessman and son of a former KGB officer. The vote, in which Tory MPs were instructed to abstain given the extent of backbench Conservative disquiet on the issue, followed revelations that the intelligence services had concerns about a peerage for Lebedev awarded by Boris Johnson, a close friend. But a Cabinet Office document released on Thursday, running to nine pages, contained no new information beyond a handful of redacted emails, including one in which Lebedev confirmed he had completed a form, and another in which an unidentified official congratulated him on the peerage. Read on here: An update from US secretary of defence Lloyd Austin, who says he had a phone call with his Ukrainian counterpart Oleksiy Reznikov: The call came as US plans for a $40bn aid package for Ukraine including money to boost the country’s defences was blocked in the Senate by a single senator, Republican Rand Paul. AP reports: With the Senate poised to debate and vote on the package of military and economic aid, Paul denied leaders the unanimous agreement they needed to proceed. The bipartisan measure, backed by President Joe Biden, underscores US determination to reinforce its support for Ukraine’s outnumbered forces. The legislation has been approved overwhelmingly by the House and has strong bipartisan support in the Senate. Final passage is not in doubt. Even so, Paul’s objection was an audacious departure from an overwhelming sentiment in Congress that quickly helping Ukraine was urgent, both for that nation’s prospects of withstanding Vladimir Putin’s brutal attack and for discouraging the Russian president from escalating or widening the war. It was also a brazen rebellion against his fellow Kentucky Republican, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. McConnell began Thursday’s session by saying senators from “both sides” – meaning Republicans and Democrats – needed to “help us pass this urgent funding bill today,” gesturing emphatically as he said “today.” Paul, a libertarian who often opposes U.S. intervention abroad, said he wanted language inserted into the bill, without a vote, that would have an inspector general scrutinize the new spending. He has a long history of demanding last-minute changes by holding up or threatening to delay bills on the brink of passage, including measures dealing with lynching, sanctioning Russia, preventing a federal shutdown, the defense budget, government surveillance and providing health care to the September 11 attack first responders. Relatives and supporters of the Ukrainian fighters holed up in the Azovstal steel plant demonstrated in Kyiv on Thursday, pleading for them to be rescued, Reuters reports. Russian forces have been bombarding the steelworks in the southern port of Mariupol, the last bastion of Ukrainian defenders in a city now almost completely controlled by Russia after more than two months of a siege. Many of the civilians holed up at the plant have been evacuated but no deal has been reached with Moscow on allowing out hundreds of fighters, some of whom are wounded. Demonstrators, mostly women, marched through central Kyiv, holding banners and chanting, “Save defenders of Mariupol, save Azovstal,” “Glory to the heroes of Mariupol,” and, “Save the military of Azovstal.” Maria Zimareva, whose relative is among the Azov battalion fighters, said tearfully: I want all the defenders who are there to return home so that they can continue a normal life with their children and relatives. People holed up in the steelworks were dying of wounds that could normally be treated, said Tetiana Pogorlova: Nobody attempts to save them. There is nothing we can do except for gathering at such demonstrations and making demands on our authorities. Mariupol resident Alina Nesterenko was also at the demonstration in the capital: The conditions they are in are horrible. I have no words to describe them. That’s why we are here. We are begging, we are pleading in every possible way, we are asking for our loved ones to be saved. This is Helen Livingstone taking over the Guardian’s live coverage of the crisis in Ukraine. A court in Kyiv will hear the first war crime trial since Vladimir Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine when a Russian soldier accused of murdering a 62-year-old civilian appears in the dock on Friday, the Guardian’s Daniel Boffey reports. The watershed moment comes as the number of crimes registered by Ukraine’s general prosecutor surpassed 11,000 and Unicef reported that at least 100 children had been killed in the war in April alone. The defendant who will appear at Kyiv’s district court is Vadim Shysimarin, a 21-year-old commander of the Kantemirovskaya tank division, who is currently in Ukrainian custody. It is alleged Shysimarin, a sergeant, had been fighting in the Sumy region in north-east Ukraine when he killed a civilian on 28 February in the village of Chupakhivka. He is accused of shooting at a civilian car after his convoy of military vehicles had come under attack from Ukrainian forces. He then drove the car away with four other soldiers as he sought to flee Ukrainian fighters. Shysimarin shot dead the unarmed man, who was on a bicycle and talking on his phone, after being ordered “to kill a civilian so he would not report them to Ukrainian defenders”, according to prosecutors. Read on here: It’s 6 pm ET here in New York. I’ll be handing the blog over to my colleagues in Australia. Here’s what happened so far: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” are ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We work step by step. We will exchange 38, then we will move on,” Vereshchuk said. The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia’s invasion has exceeded 6 million, the UN’s refugee agency said. A further 8 million people have been forced to flee their homes and are displaced inside Ukraine, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Nearly 100 children were killed in Ukraine during the month of April alone, but actual figures could be significantly higher, the United Nations children’s fund said. Unicef’s deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been “damaged or destroyed” as of last week. European Union leaders plan to assess Ukraine’s membership next month, according to the French foreign ministry. Ukraine’s application to become an EU member is being examined by the European Commission and will be “discussed at heads of state and government level at the European Council in the month of June”, a spokesperson for the ministry said. Finland must apply to join Nato “without delay” in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president, Sauli Niinistö, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said. With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, the two leaders said steps would be taken “within the next few days” to make the decision to apply, adding that Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security. Leaders of Nato member states welcomed the announcement. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said Russia would “definitely” see Finnish membership as a threat. Russia’s foreign ministry said Moscow would be “forced to take reciprocal steps … to address the resulting threats to its national security” if Helsinki applied for Nato accession. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland tomorrow, a day after Finnish leaders said they would apply to join Nato, according to reports. Key Finnish politicians have been warned that Russia could halt its gas supplies on Friday, the local newspaper Iltalehti cited unnamed sources as saying. The UN’s human rights council has passed a resolution to investigate alleged abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control, with a view to holding those responsible to account. The resolution passed by a strong majority, with 33 members voting in favour and two – China and Eritrea – against. There were 12 abstentions. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said 1,000 bodies had been recovered in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, in recent weeks. Many of the violations it is verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes, she said. Michael Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that “at least several thousand Ukrainians” have been sent to so-called “filtration centers” in Russia where they are interrogated and reportedly beaten and tortured, according to a transcript of Carpenter’s remarks. US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill to Ukraine. Paul demanded changes to the legislation that would include implementing a special inspector general to oversee how the aid is spent. More than 1,100 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Wales under the Homes for Ukraine sponsorship scheme, according to the BBC. Under the sponsorship scheme, 37,500 visas have been issued across the UK. For those visas issued for refugees to go to England, 49% have arrived, 28% of those planning to go to Scotland arrived and 16% have arrived in Northern Ireland. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says Russia has destroyed 570 health care facilities and 101 hospitals, according to the New York Times. The remarks came during his nightly address to the nation. He also said some schools were struck on Thursday in northern Ukraine. Earlier today, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution to investigate Russia’s human rights abuses in Ukraine in a 33-2 vote. US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky has blocked the passage of a $40bn aid bill to Ukraine. Paul demanded changes to the legislation that would include implementing a special inspector general to oversee how the aid is spent, according to CNN. “We cannot save Ukraine by dooming the US economy,” Paul said. Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leader Mitch McConnell offered to allow a vote on the Republican senator’s amendment. But CNN is reporting that Paul insisted that it be added to the actual bill. “The package is ready to go,” Schumer said. “The vast majority of senators on both sides of the aisle want it. There’s now only one thing holding us back the junior senator from Kentucky is preventing swift passage of Ukraine aid because he wants to add at the last minute his own changes directly into the bill. His change is strongly opposed by many members of both parties.” Michael Carpenter, the US Ambassador to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), said that “at least several thousand Ukrainians” have been sent to so-called “filtration centers” in Russia, according to a transcript of his remarks to the OSCE Permanent Council. “During this so-called ‘filtration’ process, Russia’s forces reportedly process and interrogate detained Ukrainian citizens to identify anyone with ties to the Ukrainian government or military, as well as individuals with ‘pro-Ukraine’ convictions,” Carpenter’s remarks reads. Carpenter went onto say that residents of Mariupol were reportedly evicted from shelters and forced onto buses to these “filtration camps” without telling them where they were going. “Numerous eyewitness accounts indicate that ‘filtering out’ entails beating and torturing individuals to determine whether they owe even the slightest allegiance to the Ukrainian state,” his remarks continue. More from his transcript: According to these reports, those who are judged to have such an allegiance are transferred to the so-called “Donetsk People’s Republic,” where they face a dark fate. According to one survivor, “If a person was suspected of being a ‘Ukrainian Nazi’, they took them to Donetsk for further investigation or murder…. Everybody was afraid to be taken to Donetsk.” Another survivor recounted a conversation she overheard between two Russian soldiers as she and her family were undergoing “filtration” outside of Mariupol. “What did you do with people who didn’t pass the filtration?” one soldier asked. The response: “Shot 10 and stopped counting.” Authorities in Spain have identified houses, companies and one luxury yacht belonging to Russian oligarchs who are on the sanctions list, Reuters is reporting. In the weeks since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Mariano García Fresno, the head of the General Council of Notaries’ money laundering prevention unit said the group noticed increased activity as oligarchs attempted to transfer ownership and stakes of businesses to relatives or associates. More context from Reuters: This week, the European Commission, the EU executive, said it would introduce a legislative proposal to prosecute those who attempted to evade sanctions, for instance by transferring their assets to family members. After reviewing more than 1,000 names among millions of transactions registered with Spain’s public notaries since 2004, García Fresno’s unit established that sanctioned oligarchs had stakes in at least 10 Spanish companies and 13 foreign ones. The information was handed over to the country’s financial intelligence unit and the Treasury and, in late April, the government confirmed it had frozen 12 funds and bank accounts linked to five people on the sanctions list, along with three luxury yachts and 23 properties. Some interesting analysis from Michael Kofman, director of Russia studies at the Center for Naval Analyses in Washington DC, on Russia’s mobilization problem in its invasion of Ukraine. Kofman argues that Russia is currently “operating at peacetime strength”. He notes that Vladimir Putin seems hesitant to declare a state of war. Currently, Putin has designated the invasion of Ukraine as a “special operation”. Reuters is reporting that Ukrainian forces have set on fire a Russian ship in the Black Sea: Ukrainian forces have damaged a modern Russian navy logistics ship in the Black Sea, setting it on fire, a spokesman for the Odesa regional military administration in southern Ukraine said on Thursday. Spokesman Serhiy Bratchuk said in an online post that the Vsevolod Bobrov had been struck near Snake Island, the scene of renewed fighting in recent days, but did not give details. The tiny island is located near Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Video footage shows the Azov fighters in Mariupol engaging in a counter-attack at the steel plant where hundreds of soldiers and civilians have been under siege. Graffiti shows signs of Ukrainian resistance in Russian-occupied Kherson. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Léonie Chao-Fong. Despite sanctions and boycotts against Russia’s oil exports, the country’s oil revenues are up 50% this year, according to Bloomberg, citing a report from the International Energy Agency. In 2022, Russia earned about $20bn per month in 2022 from oil sales. The revenue stream represents exports of about 8m barrels a day, according to the agency. The EU – despite its stance against the invasion – has taken in about 43% of the country’s oil exports. Russia’s supplies were down by 1m barrels a day last month, meaning that the country could soon see an economic impact from the sanctions and boycotts. It is just past 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” are ongoing to evacuate 38 seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, in exchange for Russian prisoners of war. “We work step by step.

I’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you. A baseball signed by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has sold at auction for more than $50,000, with a portion of the proceeds going to Ukrainians displaced by the Russian invasion. A Boston auctioneer, RR Auction, said the winning bid for the Rawlings Major League baseball was more than three times its estimate. The company will donate its $15,000 cut from the sale. The seller, Randy Kaplan, will donate an undisclosed portion of his proceeds to the global non-profit Americares. The ball is signed in black felt tip in Ukrainian Cyrillic and Latin letters. It is accompanied by a letter signed by Volodymyr Yelchenko, the permanent representative of Ukraine to the United Nations. Kaplan is a well-known collector of baseballs signed by world leaders who rarely auctions his prized pieces. The winning bidder wished to remain anonymous, but was described by RR Auction as a “collector from the midwest who is thrilled to have some of the funds go to the Ukraine relief effort”. Documents signed by the British naturalist Alfred Wallace, inventor Nikola Tesla, Albert Einstein and founding fathers John Hancock and John Adams were sold in the same auction. European Union leaders plan to assess Ukraine’s membership next month, according to the French foreign ministry. Ukraine’s application to become an EU member is being examined by the European Commission and will be “discussed at heads of state and government level at the European Council in the month of June”, a spokesperson for the ministry said. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said on Monday that the EU will publish an opinion on Ukrainian accession to the bloc next month. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, welcomed the UN’s human rights council vote to launch an investigation into alleged rights abuses by Russian troops in the Kyiv region. Kuleba tweeted that the “perpetrators of these barbaric crimes will be brought to justice”. Nearly 100 children were killed in Ukraine during the month of April alone, but actual figures could be significantly higher, the United Nations children’s fund said. Unicef’s deputy executive director, Omar Abdi, was speaking at the UN’s security council: In just this past month, the UN verified that nearly 100 children were killed, and we believe the actual figures to be considerably higher. The war in Ukraine was creating a “child protection and child rights crisis”, he warned. More children have been injured and faced grave violations of their rights, millions more have been displaced. Abdi also demanded an end to the bombing of Ukrainian schools, adding that one in six Unicef-supported schools in eastern Ukraine had been “damaged or destroyed” as of last week. He said: Hundreds of schools across the country are reported to have been hit by heavy artillery, airstrikes and other explosive weapons in populated areas. The horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made the whole world afraid of the atomic bomb – even those who might launch one. Today that fear has mostly passed out of living memory, and with it we may have lost a crucial safeguard, Daniel Immerwahr, associate professor of history at Northwestern University, writes. On an August morning in 1945, 600 metres over the Japanese city of Hiroshima, a small sun came briefly into existence. Few remember a sound, but the flash printed shadows on the pavements and sent buildings thrashing. The explosion – 2,000 times greater than that of any bomb yet used – announced not only a new weapon but a new era. It was a stunning military victory for the United States. Yet jubilation there was undercut by “uncertainty and fear”, the newsman Edward R Murrow observed. It took only a moment’s reflection on the bomb’s existence to see the harrowing implication: what had happened in Hiroshima, and three days later in Nagasaki, could happen anywhere. The thought proved impossible to shake, especially as, within the year, on-the-ground accounts emerged. Reports came of flesh bubbling, of melted eyes, of a terrifying sickness afflicting even those who’d avoided the blast. “All the scientists are frightened – frightened for their lives,” a Nobel-winning chemist confessed in 1946. Despite scientists’ hopes that the weapons would be retired, in the coming decades they proliferated, with nuclear states testing ever-more-powerful devices on Pacific atolls, the Algerian desert and the Kazakh steppe. The fear – the pervasive, enduring fear – that characterised the cold war is hard to appreciate today. It wasn’t only powerless city-dwellers who were terrified (“select and fortify a room in which to shelter”, the UK government grimly advised). Leaders themselves were shaken. It was “insane”, US president John F Kennedy felt, that “two men, sitting on the opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilisation”. Yet everyone knowingly lived with that insanity for decades. It was as if, wrote the historian Paul Boyer, “the Bomb” were “one of those categories of Being, like Space and Time, that, according to Kant, are built into of the very structure of our minds, giving shape and meaning to all our perceptions”. Boyer remembered the unsettling news of the Hiroshima bombing, which occurred the week of his 10th birthday and shaped the rest of his childhood. Today, someone remembering the bomb that well would have to be 86 at least. The memory of nuclear war, once vivid, is quietly vanishing. The signs on the fallout shelters – those that remain – are rusted, and most of the world’s population can’t even recall an above-ground nuclear test (the last was in 1980). The bomb no longer gives “shape and meaning to all our perceptions”; until recently, many thought of it only rarely. It has been tempting to see nuclear war as a bygone terror that no longer terrifies, like polio. Read Daniel Immerwahr’s full article: Forgetting the apocalypse: why our nuclear fears faded – and why that’s dangerous France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, told his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, that France fully supported the country’s choice to join Nato, the Elysée presidential office said in a statement. The number of people who have fled Ukraine to escape Russia’s invasion has exceeded 6 million, the UN’s refugee agency said. The majority of those who have fled the country have entered the European Union through border points in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. A further 8 million people have been forced to flee their homes and are displaced inside Ukraine, according to the International Organisation for Migration. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister, Iryna Vereshchuk, said “very difficult negotiations” are ongoing to evacuate seriously wounded fighters from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. Vereshchuk said yesterday that Kyiv had proposed to Moscow that badly injured defenders in the plant be swapped for Russian prisoners of war. Writing on her Telegram, Vereshchuk said: To be clear: we are currently negotiating only about 38 severely wounded (bedridden) fighters. We work step by step. We will exchange 38, then we will move on. There are currently no talks on the exchange of 500 or 600 people, which is being reported by some media outlets. If you’ve just joined us, here’s a quick roundup of the key events so far: Finland must apply to join Nato “without delay” in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president, Sauli Niinistö, and prime minister, Sanna Marin, said. With neighbouring Sweden expected to follow suit, the two leaders said steps would be taken “within the next few days” to make the decision to apply, adding that Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security.

The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, has told residents who fled the city that it is still not safe to return to Ukraine. He said: “Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the safety of every resident today. Every corner of Ukraine, every city and town, is under threat as Russia continues its barbaric war against our country.” Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you the news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia needs denazification, not Ukraine, according to the leader of the anti-Kremlin punk band Pussy Riot, who fled the country earlier this week by disguising herself as a food courier. Maria Alyokhina, a long-time critic of Vladimir Putin, was speaking as her band was preparing for its anti-war concert tour beginning in Berlin. She said Russians needed to think carefully about the war, telling Reuters: I have no idea what will be the end of this reflection but without that, the country doesn’t have a right to exist, like Germany after the second world war. It’s Russia where we should have a denazification, not Ukraine. There should be a tribunal against Putin and army generals and leaders, Alyokhina added. Alyokhina told the New York Times this week that she had escaped Russia disguised as a food courier after being ordered to spend 21 days in a penal colony. The 33-year-old was then able to cross into Lithuania with help from an Icelandic artist who secured her travel documents. The UN’s human rights council has passed a resolution to investigate alleged abuses by Russian troops in parts of Ukraine formerly under their control, with a view to holding those responsible to account. More than 50 countries backed Kyiv’s request for a special session of the council to examine “the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”. The resolution passed by a strong majority, with 33 members voting in favour and two – China and Eritrea – against. There were 12 abstentions. A Russian ship carrying grain stolen in Ukraine has been seen in the Syrian port of Latakia after being turned away from at least one Mediterranean port, according to reports. CNN reports that the vessel, Matros Pozynich, weighed anchor off the coast of Crimea on 27 April and turned off its transponder. Photographs and satellite images show the bulk carrier at the port of Sevastopol, the main port in Crimea, the following day. The Matros Pozynich is one of three ships involved in the trade of stolen grain, according to open-source research and Ukrainian officials. From Sevastopol, the Matros Pozynich was seen transiting the Bosphorus Strait and making its way to the Egyptian port of Alexandria, where it was turned away. The ship was also turned away from the Lebanese capital of Beirut. The vessel turned off its transponder again on 5 May but satellite imagery showed it travelled to Latakia. Ukrainian officials said the Matros Pozynich was laden with nearly 30,000 tonnes of Ukrainian wheat. Ukraine’s defence ministry has estimate that at least 400,000 tonnes of grain has been stolen and taken out of Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on 24 February. Germany may be able to cope with a boycott of Russian gas imports as soon as the coming winter, its economy minister, Robert Habeck, said. Speaking in an interview with WirtschaftsWoche translated by Reuters, Habeck said: If we have full storage facilities at the turn of the year, if two of the four floating LNG tankers we have leased are connected to the grid, and if we make significant energy savings, we can to some extent get through the winter if Russian gas supplies collapse. Everyone could play a part, he said, adding that if industries and private individuals could reduce gas consumption by 10%, it would help avoid an emergency. Gas prices would increase further, he warned. Germany has boosted efforts to reduce its reliance on Russian energy supplies but has said it expects to be largely dependent on its gas until 2024. Russia could cut its gas supplies to Finland tomorrow, a day after Finnish leaders said they should apply to join Nato “without delay”, according to the local newspaper Iltalehti. Key Finnish politicians have been warned that Russia could halt its gas supplies on Friday, the newspaper reports, citing unnamed sources and without specifying where the warning came from. If Russian gas was cut off, it would cause major problems for some Finnish industries, and food production, Iltalehti reports. Urgent measures to break the Russian blockade of grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, including by trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, will be discussed by G7 foreign and agriculture ministers at meetings in Germany. The grain exports blockade is fast becoming one of the most urgent diplomatic and humanitarian crises in Ukraine. On Tuesday, the US president, Joe Biden, said the US was working on solutions “to get this food out into the world so that it could help bring down prices.” G7 foreign ministers are meeting in the Baltic Sea resort of Weissenhaus, north-east of Hamburg, and the agriculture ministers in Stuttgart. Cem Özdemir, the German agriculture minister and a Green party member, has for months been looking with the EU at alternative train routes through Poland and Belarus to Baltic ports, but the different train gauges between Ukraine and Poland, a pre-existing backlog of traffic, and a shortage of suitable rail wagons all count against this option. By one Ukrainian estimate, only 20% of the exports it normally sends through the Black Sea ports by ship could be transported by rail to the Baltic ports. The cost of road transport has risen five-fold in the past year. Read more of our diplomatic editor Patrick Wintour’s report here: G7 to discuss action to break Russian blockade of Ukraine grain exports Here are some of the recent images that have been sent to us over the newswires depicting the impact of the war in Ukraine. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has tweeted his support of the Finnish move towards Nato membership today, saying he had spoken to Finland’s president: I welcome Finland’s decision to support the country’s accession to Nato without delay. In a phone call with President Niinistö, I assured the full support of the federal government. The US state department has announced that Joe Biden’s top diplomat, Antony Blinken, will travel to Europe on Saturday for the informal meeting of Nato foreign ministers. The statement says: On 14 May, the secretary will travel to Berlin to attend an informal meeting of Nato Foreign Ministers where Allies and partners will discuss their unified response to Russia’s continuing brutal war against Ukraine and the upcoming Leaders’ Summit in Madrid. The following day he will have trade meetings with EU leaders in Paris, alongside the US trade representative Katherine Tai and the secretary of commerce, Gina Raimondo. Ukrainian presidential adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, has demanded an immediate EU embargo on Russian oil. Podolyak tweeted: If the leaders had acted decisively in 1938, Europe could have avoided WWII. But politicians acted cowardly &amp; flirted with the aggressor. The result is million tragedies. History won’t forgive us if we make the same mistake again. Nato forces arrived in a military exercise held in North Macedonia aimed at displaying deployment readiness along the alliance’s eastern borders. Nearly 10,000 soldiers from 19 nations are taking part in Nato’s “Swift Response” exercises, held in five separate locations from Norway to North Macedonia, the newest member of the alliance, Associated Press reports. Ukraine’s deputy foreign minister, Emine Dzhaparova, has condemned the “sheer horror” and “pure evil” of Russia’s war in Ukraine in an address to the UN’s human rights council. Russia was committing “the most gruesome human rights violations on the European continent in decades”, Dzhaparova said at an extraordinary meeting of the council about Moscow’s alleged violations. The UN’s top rights body will vote on a draft resolution calling for an investigation into alleged abuses by Russian troops in the Kyiv area that Ukraine says amount to war crimes, with a view to holding those responsible to account. More than 50 countries backed Kyiv’s request for a special session of the council to examine “the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”. Speaking from Kyiv, Dzhaparova said: These have been 10 weeks of sheer horror to the people of my country. Torture and enforced disappearances, sexual and gender-based violence; the list of Russia’s crimes is endless. Only the world standing strong in solidarity with the Ukrainian people can defeat this pure evil. One of the biggest donors to Britain’s Conservative party is suspected of secretly funnelling hundreds of thousands of pounds to the party from a Russian bank account, according to a report filed to the UK’s National Crime Agency. The New York Times reports that a donation of £450,000 was made in February 2018 in the name of Ehud Sheleg, who was most recently the party’s treasurer. The money went towards propelling Boris Johnson and his party to its victory in the 2019 general elections. The cash has since been found to originate from a Russian account of Sheleg’s father-in-law, Sergei Kopytov, who was a once a senior politician in Ukraine’s previous pro-Kremlin government and who now owns real estate and businesses in Crimea and Russia. The donation was flagged by Barclays bank as both suspected money laundering and a potentially illegal campaign donation. It is illegal for UK political parties to accept donations of more than £500 from foreign citizens who are not registered to vote in Britain. A lawyer for Sheleg said he received millions from his father-in-law before the donation, but said it was “entirely separate” from the campaign contribution. The NYT said there was no indication that the Conservative party or the prime minister knew about the source of the donation. The journalist behind the story, Jane Bradley, has tweeted a thread that usefully provides the key points from her report: Leaders of Nato member states have welcomed the announcement by Finland president and prime minister that the country should apply to join the alliance. Poland’s prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said Finland’s decision to apply for Nato membership was “great news for Poland and Europe’s security”. The prime minister of the Czech Republic, Petr Fiala, said his country would “of course” support Finland’s bid to join the alliance. Estonia’s prime minister, Kaja Kallas, said history was being made by its northern neighbours and that Finland could count on her country’s “full support”. Estonia’s president, Alar Karis, said Russia’s attempts to portray Nato expansion as offensive “are just fruits of their own failure to live at peace” with its neighbours. The Danish prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said Denmark would do “everything possible” to support a swift application process after Finland’s formal application. The president of Romania, Klaus Iohannis, said his country stood ready to support Finland in its Nato accession. Latvia’s prime minister, Krišjānis Kariņš, said Finland’s decision marked “an important turn towards an even stronger alliance and greater security in the Baltic Sea region”. Also, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, described Finland’s move as a “historic step” that would “greatly contribute to European security”. Russia will be forced to respond to Finland’s decision to join the Nato alliance, its foreign ministry said in a statement. The statement said: Finland joining Nato is a radical change in the country’s foreign policy. Russia will be forced to take retaliatory steps, both of a military-technical and other nature, in order to stop threats to its national security arising. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said Finland would be “warmly welcomed” into the alliance and promised the accession process would be “smooth and swift”. Nato membership of Finland would strengthen both the alliance and Finland, Stoltenberg said after Finland announced it would apply to join Nato “without delay”. Stoltenberg said: Should Finland decide to apply, they would be warmly welcomed into Nato, and the accession process would be smooth and swift. Finland is one of Nato’s “closest partners, a mature democracy, a member of the European Union, and an important contributor to Euro-Atlantic security”, he added. Finnish membership to Nato would prove that the alliance’s “door is open”, Stoltenberg said, and that Finland “decides its own future”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he had spoken with his Finnish counterpart, Sauli Niinistö, and “commended” him on Finland’s move to join Nato. Niinistö tweeted earlier that he had spoken to Zelenskiy, who had “expressed his full support” for Finland’s steps towards Nato membership. Here’s more from Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, who earlier said Finland’s move to join Nato was “definitely” a threat to Russia. Asked in a briefing whether Finnish entry to the alliance presented a threat to Russia, Peskov replied: Definitely. Nato expansion does not make our continent more stable and secure. Finland had joined “unfriendly steps” against Russia, Reuters cited him saying. Asked what form Russia’s response would take, Peskov said: Everything will depend on how this expansion process of Nato expansion plays out, the extent to which military infrastructure moves closer to our borders. The Kremlin also spoke about Russian sanctions imposed on Gazprom’s former German unit and other entities, which it said meant they cannot receive gas supplies from Russia. Peskov said: Sanctions are blocking, so there could be no any relations with these companies, nor they can take part in (gas) supplies. Finland must apply to join Nato without delay in the wake of Russia’s attack on Ukraine, its president and prime minister have said, confirming a historic change in the Nordic country’s security policy after decades of military non-alignment. Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin made the call in a joint statement on Thursday, adding: “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” Finland shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia. Public support for Nato membership has trebled in Finland. The president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make the formal decision on submitting the country’s membership application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Dmitry Peskov said that Finnish entry to Nato is “definitely” a threat to Russia. The Kremlin spokesperson said everybody wants to avoid a direct clash between Russia and Nato, and that Nato expansion will not make the world or Europe more stable. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has said he has spoken today to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Zelenskiy supported Finland’s steps towards Nato membership. Other European Nato leaders from Estonia, Denmark ands Romania have also voiced support. The UN human rights chief has said a thousand bodies had been recovered in the area of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in recent weeks, adding that many of the violations it is verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes. “The scale of unlawful killings, including indicia of summary executions in areas to the north of Kyiv, is shocking,” Michelle Bachelet told the Geneva-based Human Rights Council via a video address. Russian news agencies have reported that Russian forces hit two ammunition depots in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine overnight. The defence ministry also said Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian S-300 air defence missile system in the Kharkiv region and a radar station near the city of Odesa. Firing from Ukraine has killed one person and wounded seven in the Russian border village of Solokhi in the province of Belgorod, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has said. Overnight the Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other equipment in the village of Bilohorivka, that had been struck when the Russians were attempting to construct a pontoon-bridge over the Siverskyi Donets river. The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. The withdrawal of Russian forces from Kharkiv is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has warned residents who fled the city that it is still not safe to return to Ukraine. He said “Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the safety of every resident today. Every corner of Ukraine, every city and town, is under threat as Russia continues its barbaric war against our country.” Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Germany’s response to the war with Russia during a visit to Berlin, saying that the country had now taken a leading role. There had been some tensions in Berlin-Kyiv relations earlier in the war. Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson reiterated that a normalisation of relations with Vladimir Putin seemed impossible, accusing the Russian President of having “grossly violated human rights” and international law, saying “He’s guilty of absolutely barbaric onslaught on a totally innocent country.” Freelance journalist from Spain Pablo González is spending his 10th week in Polish custody while prosecutors there investigate what they claim is a case of espionage linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. That is it from me, Martin Belam, in London for now. I will be back later. In the meantime, Léonie Chao-Fong will continue to bring you the latest news. The Kremlin’s Dmitry Peskov has been giving one of his regular morning briefings by phone to journalists. The key lines being reported by Reuters include: Peskov said Finnish entry to Nato is “definitely” a threat to Russia. He said Finland had joined the unfriendly steps towards Russia taken by the EU, which was a matter of regret and a reason for a symmetrical response. The Kremlin spokesperson said everybody wants to avoid a direct clash between Russia and Nato, and that Nato expansion will not make the world or Europe more stable. Peskov said attacks on Russian regions bordering Ukraine means additional measures are needed to ensure the security of those regions. Here are some fuller quotes, via PA Media, of what the UK’s Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier on LBC radio when he was being asked about any future normalisation of relationships with Vladimir Putin and Russia. Johnson said: I think that repentance is going to be very difficult for Vladimir Putin now. Nothing is impossible, I suppose, but I just cannot see for the life of me how we can renormalise relations with Putin now. He has grossly violated human rights, international law. He’s guilty of absolutely barbaric onslaught on a totally innocent country. And to renormalise would be to make the mistake that we made in 2014 [following the annexing of Crimea]. And if the Ukrainians were to do any kind of deal with Putin now, the risk is that he would do exactly the same thing, and they know it. So the short answer is no. No renormalisation and the UK is very clear about that. The interview was recorded on Wednesday and broadcast this morning. Ukraine’s announcement on Tuesday that it would suspend the flow of gas through a transit point bringing Russian fuel to Europe does not present a gas supply issue, the European Commission said today, Reuters reports. “While these developments may have an impact on part of the gas transit to the EU, they do not bring about any immediate security of supply issue for the EU,” a commission spokesperson said, adding that Ukraine’s inability to operate the Novopskov gas compressor station was a result of actions by Russia. “Ukraine has been a reliable transit partner for many years,” the spokesperson said. There was also confirmation that the EU energy commissioner will have talks today with Ukraine’s energy minister. Romania’s president, Klaus Iohannis, has added his voice to those supporting Finland’s moves towards Nato membership. He tweeted: I welcome the joint statement by Finland’s President Sauli Niinistö and Prime Minister Marin Sanna on Finland’s Nato membership. Romania is a strong promoter of Nato’s ‘open door’ policy and stands ready to support Finland in the process of Nato accession. Together we are stronger! A freelance journalist from Spain is spending his 10th week in Polish custody while prosecutors there investigate what they claim is a case of espionage linked to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In a case that raises red flags about press freedom in Europe at a time of war, prosecutors are expected next week to ask a judge for a further three-month extension to the detention of Pablo González, who has freelanced for media including Spain’s La Sexta TV channel, Spanish state news agency EFE and the US-government funded Voice of America. The prosecutors’ request must be filed before 15 May, two weeks before his current three-month detention order expires. Under Polish law, González can be held in custody until he is put on trial, a process lawyers say could easily take more than a year. Polish officials claim he is an agent of Russia’s GRU military intelligence. “He carried out operations for the benefit of Russia, profiting from his status of journalist, which enabled him to freely travel around the world and Europe, including military conflict zones,” according to a spokesperson for Poland’s minister coordinator of special services. Read more of Giles Tremlett’s report here: Spanish journalist held in Poland on suspicion of pro-Russian espionage The UN human rights chief has said a thousand bodies had been recovered in the area of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv in recent weeks, adding that many of the violations it is verifying since the Russian invasion may amount to war crimes. “The scale of unlawful killings, including indicia of summary executions in areas to the north of Kyiv, is shocking,” Michelle Bachelet told the Geneva-based Human Rights Council via a video address. Reuters reports the Human Rights Council will decide today whether to task investigators with an official probe into the events that occurred in Kyiv and other regions in February and March. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, has just tweeted that he has spoken to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, and that Zelenskiy supported Finland’s steps towards Nato membership. Niinistö said: I spoke with President Zelenskiy and reiterated Finland’s firm support for Ukraine. I informed him of Finland’s steps towards Nato membership and he expressed his full support for it. Dmitry Medvedev, the former Russian president and long-time ally of Vladimir Putin, has reacted this morning to news of Finland and Sweden moving closer to seeking Nato membership. He posted to Telegram: In the context of the proxy war unleashed by western countries with Russia, I want to articulate once again very clearly things that are already so obvious to all reasonable people. 1. The pumping of Ukraine by Nato countries with weapons, the training of its troops to use western equipment, the dispatch of mercenaries and the conduct of exercises by the countries of the alliance near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between Nato and Russia instead of their “war by proxy”. 2. Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war. 3. This will be a catastrophic scenario for everyone. He finished by urging the west “do not lie to yourself and others” and “do not choke on your own saliva in the paroxysms of Russophobia!” Finland and Sweden may be moving toward joining Nato at pace, but there are still some hurdles in the way. Robin Emmott at Reuters has written a quick projected timeline of what might happen next. Nato officials and diplomats say that ideally the two countries should submit their requests together to simply the process. Representatives of the 30 allies would then meet in Brussels to discuss, and most probably accept, the membership request. Both countries are thought to already meet entry criteria around democracy and the status of their military. There would then follow a meeting between Nato and representatives of the aspiring members, where they would be questioned about their commitment to Nato’s collective defence pledge. Being accepted as members is not the end of the process though – membership would have to be ratified by the national governments of each of the 30 allies, in a process that could drag on for months. Sweden’s foreign minister, Ann Linde, has tweeted in response to the announcement that Finland’s president and prime minister say Finland should seek Nato membership without delay. Linde tweeted: Important message today from president Sauli Niinistö and prime minister Sanna Marin on Nato membership. Finland is Sweden’s closest security &amp; defence partner, and we need to take Finland’s assessments into account. Sweden will decide after the report from the security policy consultations has been presented. Swedish newspaper Expressen is leading with what it claims is an exclusive that Sweden will move forward with an application to join Nato on Monday. Helena Gissén reports: The government is holding an extra meeting on Monday to make the formal decision on a Swedish Nato application. Immediately after the meeting, the application will be submitted if nothing unforeseen occurs, sources told Expressen. Russian news agencies have reported that Russian forces hit two ammunition depots in the Chernihiv region of Ukraine overnight. Reuters reports the defence ministry also said Russia had destroyed a Ukrainian S-300 air defence missile system in the Kharkiv region and a radar station near the city of Odesa. Swedish politician Annie Lööf is one of those who has seen Finland’s move today towards seeking Nato membership as a call to action for Sweden as well. Lööf has tweeted: The eyes of the outside world are now resting on Sweden and Finland. Sweden needs to go hand in hand with Finland to strengthen security and safety in the Nordic and Baltic region. Finnish politician Elina Valtonen has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK about the proposal that Finland joins Nato without delay, as set out by the Finnish president and prime minister this morning. She told viewers: Finland has been a neutral country for many decades, but we never forgot about the threats of our eastern neighbour. We never were part of the Soviet Union because we have fought wars against Russia and the Soviet Union in our past. But now it’s a different time. We saw that our neighbour has become even more aggressive, more unpredictable. And we feel it’s the right time to join Nato. Following the events in Ukraine, we feel that it’s just a logical situation now to join Nato, to partner up with our friends and our allies in the west. We are a western country. We have been a stable democracy for 100 years, and together we are stronger in defending our common values. On the issue of whether joining Nato might increase the threat from Russia to Finland, she said: Nato is a defensive alliance, and Nato is not there to threaten. Finland – and possibly Sweden also – in the future will have joined Nato based on their free will, the free will of the people. We are democracies and we want to defend our values. That’s as simple as it is. Here is the full text of that joint statement from Sauli Niinistö and Sanna Marin, president and prime minister of Finland respectively: During the spring, there has been an important discussion about Finland’s possible Nato membership. Time has been needed for domestic position formation both in Parliament and in society as a whole. Time has been needed for close international contacts with both Nato and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the debate the space it needs. Now that the time for decision-making is approaching, we also state our own common positions for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security. As a member of Nato, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership as a matter of urgency. We hope that the national steps still needed to reach this solution will be taken swiftly in the coming days. Estonia’s prime minister Kaja Kallas has said that her country supports Finland’s rapid accession to Nato. In a tweet she said: History being made by our northern neighbours. You can count on our full support. We support a rapid accession process. From our side will make necessary steps quickly. Finland must apply to join the Nato military alliance “without delay”, Finnish President Sauli Niinisto and Prime Minister Sanna Marin said this morning, Reuters reports, indicating a major policy shift triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Nato membership would strengthen Finland’s security. As a member of Nato, Finland would strengthen the entire defence alliance. Finland must apply for Nato membership without delay,” Niinisto and Marin said in a joint statement. “We hope that the national steps still needed to make this decision will be taken rapidly within the next few days.” Yesterday, a Gallup poll commissioned by Helsingin Sanomat reported that 73% percent of respondents believe that Finland should join the military alliance as Nato. The figure was eight percentage points higher than in a similar survey at the end of April. Denmark’s prime minister Mette Frederiksen has already responded this morning by saying that Finland would be welcomed into Nato and that she will work for a quick process. Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba praised Germany’s response to the war with Russia during a visit to Berlin, saying that the country had now taken a leading role. There had been some tensions in Berlin-Kyiv relations earlier in the war. In an interview with German broadcaster ARD, Kuleba said there had been positive changes, after Germany decided to deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine and back a proposed EU embargo on Russian oil following pressure from its allies. During the Ukrainian diplomat’s visit, which will also include an appearance at the G7 foreign ministers’ meeting on the German Baltic Sea coast, Reuters reports Kuleba said he plans to lobby for Ukrainian EU membership, as well as further sanctions on Russia and a response to food scarcity threatened by the conflict. The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has reiterated his government’s position that there can be no renormalisation of relationships with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Reuters reports that asked on LBC radio whether Putin could be welcomed back on the global stage if he were to repent, Johnson said: “The short answer is no. No renormalisation and the UK is very clear about that.” Overnight the Ukrainian defence ministry published photos of what it said were destroyed Russian tanks and other equipment in the village of Bilohorivka, that had been struck when the Russians were attempting to construct a pontoon-bridge over the Siverskyi Donets river. The general staff of the Ukraine armed forces published the pictures again this morning on Facebook. An unverified thread which claims to detail the logistics of the operation has also gone viral on social media. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has warned residents who fled the city that it is still not safe to return to Ukraine. In response to an interview question about the prospects for return, he posted to Telegram: Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee the safety of every resident today. Every corner of Ukraine, every city and town, is under threat as Russia continues its barbaric war against our country. Firing from Ukraine has killed one person and wounded seven in the Russian border village of Solokhi in the province of Belgorod, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, has said according to Reuters. Authorities in the area bordering Ukraine have accused Kyiv of a series of strikes, including a helicopter raid on a fuel depot. Kyiv, which has been fighting off a Russian invasion since February, has not claimed responsibility for the attacks. The withdrawal of Russian forces from Kharkiv is a tacit recognition of Russia’s inability to capture key Ukrainian cities where they expected limited resistance from the population, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update. Ukrainian forces were continuing to counter attack to the north of the city and had recaptured several towns and villages near the Russian border, it continued. It also said Moscow’s prioritisation of the operation in Donbas had left those units left around Kharkiv “vulnerable to the mobile, and highly motivated, Ukrainian counter-attacking force”. “Despite Russia’s success in encircling Kharkiv in the initial stages of the conflict, it has reportedly withdrawn units from the region to reorganise and replenish its forces following heavy losses. “Once reconstituted, these forces will likely deploy to the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, forming a blocking force to protect the western flank of Russia’s main force concentration and main supply routes for operations in the vicinity of Izium,” it continued. The US State Department has released a fresh study on Russia’s disinformation campaigns on chemical and biological weapons, accusing Moscow of using its seats on international bodies such as the UN Security Council and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to help justify its war on Ukraine. The Kremlin’s spreading of unfounded and debunked allegations that the United States and Ukraine are conducting chemical and biological weapons activities in Ukraine is part of a well-established Russian disinformation tactic. The Kremlin has a long track record of accusing others of the very violations they commit. The United States does not own or operate any chemical or biological laboratories in Ukraine and is in full compliance with its obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). Ukraine is also in full compliance with its obligations under the CWC and BWC. It is, in fact, the Russian Federation that has active chemical and biological weapons programs and is in violation of its international obligations. The State Department said the Russian government had used similar tactics during the war in Syria, in a bid to shield the Assad regime when it used chemical weapons including a 2017 sarin gas attack in Khan Sheikhun. It also pointed out that Russia has denied responsibility for the 2018 Novichok poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia Skripal in Salisbury, UK and the related death of Dawn Sturgess, as well as the poisoning of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Each time, the Kremlin used its seat in multilateral organizations as a platform to spread its disinformation. A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol has appealed directly to Elon Musk on Wednesday, asking the world’s richest man to intervene on behalf of those trapped by Russian forces in control of the southern city, AFP reports. The three-month-old war has devastated the strategic port, where Ukrainians have sustained a pocket of resistance from within the Azovstal steelworks after weeks of bloody battle. Serhiy Volyna, commander of the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, said he created a Twitter account for the sole purpose of reaching out to Musk. “People say you come from another planet to teach people to believe in the impossible,” Volyna tweeted at Musk. “Our planets are next to each other, as I live where it is nearly impossible to survive. Help us get out of Azovstal to a mediating country. If not you, then who?” He called on “every person on the planet Earth” to help ensure Musk saw his appeal. Earlier this week, Kyiv said that more than 1,000 of its troops, many of them injured, remained in the sprawling Azovstal plant, sheltering in the labyrinth of Soviet-era bunkers and tunnels from the Russians who now control Mariupol. Women, children and the elderly have been evacuated from the besieged site as part of a humanitarian mission coordinated by the United Nations and the Red Cross. Twitter, which Musk is seeking to buy in a $44 billion deal, has seen an explosion of users due to the war in Ukraine, with people using the social media service to find news and support, according to the company. Musk, who has more than 92 million followers, has previously used the platform to challenge Russian president Vladimir Putin to “single combat” over Ukraine. Last month, the South African-born Tesla chief responded to a Ukrainian plea for internet service by activating his Starlink satellite broadband service and sending equipment to help bring connectivity to areas hit by Russian military attacks. Finland is expected to announce its intention to join Nato on Thursday with Sweden likely to follow soon after, diplomats and officials have said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reshapes European security and the Atlantic military alliance. Nato allies expect Finland and Sweden to be granted membership quickly, five diplomats and officials told Reuters, paving the way for increased troop presence in the Nordic region during the one-year ratification period. In the lead-up to their Nato accession, British prime minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday promised to defend Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements. In the wider Nordic region, Norway, Denmark and the three Baltic states are already Nato members, and the addition of Finland and Sweden would probably anger Moscow, which says enlargement of the organisation is a direct threat to its own security. Russian president Vladimir Putin has cited the issue as a reason for his actions in Ukraine, which has also expressed a desire to eventually join the alliance. Moscow has also repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining the alliance, threatening “serious military and political consequences”. Asked on Wednesday if Finland would provoke Russia by joining Nato, president Sauli Niinistö said Putin would be to blame. “My response would be that you caused this. Look at the mirror,” Niinisto said. Read on here: Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said after talks with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida. Von der Leyen and European Council president Charles Michel are in Japan for talks that have touched on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but also growing concerns about China’s role in Asia and beyond, AFP reports. The annual summit comes with much of the international community rallying to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is not just a matter for Europe, but it shakes the core of the international order including Asia. This must not be tolerated,” said Kishida, whose government has joined tough sanctions on Moscow, including on energy. Beijing’s increasingly muscular stance in Asia was also on the agenda, with the EU looking to take a more high-profile role in confronting China. Our cooperation in Ukraine is critical in Europe, but it’s also important in the Indo-Pacific and we also want to deepen our consultation on a more assertive China,” said Michel. China must stand up to defend the multilateral system that it has benefitted from in developing its country. Japan and the EU have been working to strengthen ties, including with a landmark 2019 trade deal, and Tokyo has broken with past diplomatic postures to take a strong stand on Ukraine. It has sanctioned Russian businesses and officials, sent humanitarian and financial aid to Ukraine and joined a G7 pledge to phase out or ban Russian oil. Japan has, however, stopped short of measures on gas because of its reliance on energy imports. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine with me, Helen Livingstone. A roundup of the latest developments: European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen warned that Russia “is today the most direct threat to the world order with the barbaric war against Ukraine, and its worrying pact with China.” The annual summit with Japanese prime minister Fumio Kishida comes as much of the international community rallying to pressure Moscow over Ukraine. Finland’s president, Sauli Niinisto, is expected to give a green light on Thursday for the country to join the NATO military alliance, while Sweden is expected to do so in the coming days. UK prime minister Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary. A Ukrainian commander in Mariupol has appealed directly to Elon Musk, asking the world’s richest man to intervene on behalf of those trapped by Russian forces in control of the southern city. “People say you come from another planet to teach people to believe in the impossible,” Serhiy Volyna tweeted at Musk. “Our planets are next to each other, as I live where it is nearly impossible to survive. Help us get out of Azovstal to a mediating country. If not you, then who?” The Russian-controlled administration in the Ukrainian city of Kherson has said it plans to request annexation by Moscow, a move that would confirm the Kremlin’s permanent occupation of Ukrainian territory captured since February. Kyiv said Moscow plans to hold a fake referendum on independence or annexation. The Kremlin responded that it was up to residents living in region to decide whether they wanted to join Russia. Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east. Despite claims from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counteroffensives around Kharkiv and elsewhere were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Ukraine claimed it has recaptured Pytomnyk, a village north of Kharkiv, about halfway to the Russian border. “The occupying forces moved to the defence in order to slow down the pace of the offensive of our troops,” Ukraine’s general staff of the armed forces said in its latest report. “The settlement of Pytomnyk … was liberated.” Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point that it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control. Gas flows from Russia’s Gazprom to Europe via Ukraine fell by a quarter on Wednesday. Zelenskiy warned Kyiv was running out of patience to hold talks with Russia, given the mounting evidence of atrocities committed by Russian forces in his country. He said the possibility to negotiate “disappears” with “each new Bucha, each new Mariupol”. The war will end when Ukraine reclaims everything that Russia took from it, Zelenskiy maintained. “The war will end for the Ukrainian people only when we get back what’s ours,” he said in an online address with students of leading universities in France, representatives of academia and the media. Three Russian prisoners of war accused of targeting or murdering civilians, and a soldier who allegedly killed a man before raping his wife, are set to be in the dock in the first war crimes trials of the Ukraine conflict, the Ukrainian prosecutor general has revealed. More than 10,700 crimes have been registered since the war began by the office of Ukraine’s prosecutor general, led by Iryna Venediktova, and a handful of cases have now been filed or are ready to be submitted. Ukraine has proposed to Russia that badly injured defenders in the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port of Mariupol be swapped for Russian prisoners of war, deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Wednesday. “There is no agreement yet. Negotiations are continuing,” she said in a post on Telegram. A Chinese former ambassador to Ukraine, Gao Yusheng, has strongly criticised Russia’s invasion. In a speech which was reported on by the Chinese press before quickly being taken down, Gao said Putin’s frequent “violations” of former Soviet states’ territory were “the greatest threat to peace," security and stability in Eurasia”.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine will prevail as Europe did in 1945, Scholz to say in VE Day speech",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/ukraine-will-prevail-as-europe-did-in-1945-scholz-says-in-ve-day-speech,2022-05-08T17:29:07Z,German chancellor will draw parallel with second world war defeat of Nazi dictatorship in TV address,"Ukraine will prevail over Russia as freedom prevailed over the Nazi dictatorship in 1945, the German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will say in a TV address to mark the 77th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, in which he will accuse Vladimir Putin of falsifying history. In the speech, which will be aired on German TV at 8.20pm CET (7.20pm BST) on Sunday, Scholz says the “legacy of 8 May” for his country must be to help to ensure that there will never again be genocide or tyranny in Europe. “I am deeply convinced. Putin will not win the war,” the centre-left politician says. “Ukraine will prevail. Freedom and safety will win, just like freedom and safety triumphed over servitude, violence and dictatorship 77 years ago.” Scholz says it is “falsifying history and disgraceful” of Russia’s president to equate his own “barbaric war of aggression” with the fight against National Socialism. “It is our duty to state this clearly,” his speech says. In keeping with previous postwar German leaders’ messages on 8 May, Scholz thanks the Allied forces for their defeat of Nazi Germany, and says his country owes a debt to both Russia and Ukraine, which suffered millions of casualties in the second world war. Scholz has repeatedly declared Germany’s support for Ukraine’s defensive effort but diplomatic relations between Berlin and Kyiv have been frosty. Ukrainian diplomats have accused his left-liberal coalition government of stalling over embargoes on Russian energy and deliveries of military hardware. The chancellor, meanwhile, appeared personally piqued after Germany’s president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, previously a Social Democratic party (SPD) ally, was told last month he was not welcome to visit Kyiv along with eastern European leaders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week he had made up with Steinmeier and invited Scholz to pay a symbolic visit to Ukraine’s capital on 9 May. The German leader did not give any indication on Sunday of whether he was likely to accept or not. Several European politicians have visited Ukraine since the start of the war in late February, including the leader of the German parliamentary opposition. Canada’s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, made a surprise visit to Irpin on Sunday, and the US president’s wife, Jill Biden, met Ukraine’s first lady, Olena Zelenska, during an unannounced visit to the west of the country. In what she called an “icebreaker” visit, the president of the Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, also travelled to Kyiv on Sunday to commemorate the victims of the second world war, laying wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier with her Ukrainian counterpart, Ruslan Stefanchuk, the chair of the Verkhovna Rada. “To me this day is special because it does not merely commemorate but should serve to reconcile,” said Bas, whose presiding role over sessions in Germany’s legislature is comparable to that of the speaker in other parliaments. The SPD politician said her visit was meant to commemorate all victims of the second world war, those in Ukraine as well as Russia, Poland, Belarus, the Baltic States and other states in central and eastern Europe. Public figures in Berlin, meanwhile, stayed away from gatherings to mark the anniversary of Nazi Germany’s surrender over fears that commemorative events could be used for propaganda purposes. “The situation is very oppressive, and any commemorations have to take that into account,” said Berlin’s mayor, Franziska Giffey, justifying her and her senators’ absence at the traditional laying of wreaths at the Soviet War Memorial in the city’s Treptower Park. The Russian embassy in the German capital, which has organised the event in the past, has not made its plans public this year because of security concerns. Germany’s surrender is traditionally celebrated in western Europe on 8 May, but because time zones it is marked on 9 May in Russia, Belarus, Serbia and Israel. Berlin’s senator for interior affairs, Iris Spranger, said police would seek to suppress any public displays of support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 8 and 9 May, including the beeping of horns at car rallies. About 1,000 people attended a pro-Russia rally at Cologne’s Fühlinger lake on Sunday, waving the red-white-and-blue flag of the modern Russian republic and the red flag of the former Soviet Union. The display of Russian flags in the vicinity of 15 memorial sites in Berlin was banned. The city’s decision to also include Ukrainian flags in its ban has been heavily criticised by the country’s ambassador to Germany. Andrij Melnyk said the ban, which exempts flag displays by diplomats, was “a slap in the face of the Ukrainian people”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why does the UK have the highest inflation in the G7?,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/18/why-uk-highest-inflation-g7-ukraine-covid-brexit,2022-05-18T16:17:14Z,"Analysis: UK among hardest-hit countries thanks to perfect storm of war in Ukraine, Covid and Brexit","Britain’s inflation rate has soared to the highest level since the early 1980s. After a record increase in gas and electricity bills in April, inflation is the highest in the G7. Having reached 9% last month, it is above the 8.3% rate in the US and Germany’s 7.4%. Japan, an economy characterised by low inflation for decades thanks to an ageing population, has the lowest rate at 1.2%. Here are some of the reasons why prices are rising faster in the UK than in other major economies. Energy Britain is a net importer of energy, meaning it is exposed to global price shocks. The post-lockdown surge in oil and gas prices, exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine, is no exception. However, some other countries have done more in response. France has a 4% cap on electricity price rises, helped by state ownership of the energy producer EDF. The country also sources the majority of its energy needs from nuclear. Italy has a windfall tax on energy firms and is spending €8bn (£6.8bn) to shield consumers from higher bills. Spain and Portugal are capping gas prices after winning approval from the EU. Germany has cut fuel tax by 30 cents a litre, compared with a Britain’s 5p cut. Ireland has cut public transport fares by 20%, while Spain and Belgium have cut VAT on energy bills – something Boris Johnson claimed could be done after Brexit, but has failed to enacted. The UK government has announced £22bn of support for high energy costs for the current financial year, including cuts to fuel duty, a council tax rebate and repayable loans on energy bills. The measures do not, however, influence the headline inflation rate. Labour says the UK is the only country in the G7 where the government is raising taxes in the middle of the cost of living crisis, after the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, pushed through an increase in national insurance contributions last month. Brexit and a slump in the pound Britain is a highly open economy with total trade equivalent to 60% of GDP. The UK’s manufacturing base is also smaller than countries such as Germany and Italy. Disruption from the pandemic, along with China’s “zero Covid” policy, has pushed up freight prices and caused costly delays. However, companies in Britain face additional costs from Brexit, with reams of paperwork and border delays adding to the pressure. The EU accounts for about half of total imports. Though just under half of food consumed in Britain is produced domestically, including the majority of grains, meat, dairy, and eggs, much comes from the EU. The thinktank UK in a Changing Europe estimated post-Brexit trade barriers pushed up food prices by 6% between December 2019 and September 2021. The pound has slumped in recent months, dropping to the lowest level against the US dollar since the early days of the pandemic. This will add to inflation by driving up the cost of imports. Worker shortages Fewer foreign workers are seeking jobs in the UK after Brexit, while many older people left the workforce during the pandemic. Labour shortages are leading companies to increase pay, adding to their wage bills, and leading them to raise the prices they charge for goods and services. Unemployment has fallen to the lowest level since the mid-1970s, with the number of people out of work below the number of vacancies for the first time ever. Annual average pay growth, excluding bonuses, has risen to 4.2%, among the fastest rates for a decade. The Bank of England believes domestically generated inflation is higher in Britain than in the EU, where wage growth in the year to the final quarter of 2021 was 1.6%. However, it is less pronounced than in the US, where one measure of wage growth hit a record high of 6% in March. However, average pay growth is still failing to keep pace with the soaring cost of living.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of desperate Ukrainians are still searching for missing relatives,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/07/ukrainians-take-dna-tests-identify-bucha-dead,2022-05-07T06:00:25Z,People visit a tent hoping to find loved ones – or a negative result that means they may still be alive,"The video was a terrible way for Vadim Yevdokimenko to find out that his father had been murdered. Alexei had been missing for weeks, since he went out in early March to scavenge firewood for cooking in their shattered, Russian-occupied town of Bucha. Yevdokimenko and his mother, Lilia, clung to a fading hope that he might have been captured and taken across the border, and that he would return in a prisoner exchange – the fate of some Ukrainian men. But this week the 20-year-old student barber spotted his father’s face in footage of Ukrainians tortured and murdered during the occupation. The only solace the family can reach for now is giving Alexei a decent burial, but they cannot find his body. So they had come to wait outside a white tent set up in the grounds of Bucha hospital, where French forensic investigators were swabbing a queue of quietly desperate people for their DNA, to see if any of them have relatives lying in the nearby morgue. After weeks of exhumations, the morgue holds more than 200 bodies that have not been identified. Some were buried without documents and are waiting to be claimed, but many are too disfigured by their deaths, or their treatment after death, to be identified by sight. “This is the first time we have done this. At first we didn’t know how many people would come,” said Andrei Turbar, the deputy prosecutor for Bucha district, as dozens of relatives filled in forms and waited for their tests. The crowd underlined how many people are missing in just one small suburban town outside Kyiv. Ukrainians who saw their loved ones killed or have collected their bodies for burial are grappling with terrible grief. But thousands more are dealing with a loss compounded by the agony of uncertainty. Some are searching for children or parents, a spouse or siblings who went missing when the Russians were slaughtering civilians. Others got bad news from a friend or an image online, but have not been able to find the remains of the person they loved. So everyone lining up outside the tent in Bucha has come with the bleakest of hopes – to continue in limbo, confirm a death, or find a body they will be able to bury but not recognise. The UN’s top human rights envoy, Michelle Bachelet, highlighted the torment of those with missing relatives “desperate to know where they are, if they are alive, and how they can get them back”, in a speech to the security council on Thursday. Vera Kunayeva and Olga Zaetz are friends whose sons were neighbours and went missing together in early March. The two women are praying their DNA will not match any of the bodies, so they can carry on believing the missing men may be prisoners somewhere in Russia, as Yevdokimenko and his mother did until a couple of days earlier. “We came to do the DNA tests but we hope it is useless, and shows they are alive,” said Kunayeva, whose 40-year-old son, Vadim, is her only child, a family man with two teenagers. Zaetz’s missing son Maxim is a factory worker and at 33 still her baby, the youngest of three brothers. The men went out at 5pm, neighbours said, and were never seen again. “They started volunteering the first day when the Russians arrived, taking aid to older and vulnerable people,” Zaetz said. “I wasn’t worried because they were always doing it, they were used to helping.” The area was isolated by Russian troops, half-destroyed by shelling and then occupied, so residents who were hungry and reduced to cooking on open fires had to rely on each other for aid. Kunayeva’s eyes filled with tears as she described what the village had been through, and remembered Vadim. “We want this over, we want victory and the Russians destroyed.” The number of unidentified bodies in this small suburban town goes up and down daily, said Turbar. Even as some victims are identified by tattoos, scars or other marks, Bucha’s sandy soil is still giving up more grim evidence of Russian brutality. “In the beginning it was 40 or 50 people exhumed a day. It is going down now. Yesterday we had seven, today four,” Turbar said. Volunteers are helping retrieve bodies from shallow graves, because authorities cannot keep up. Many are only discovered when residents who fled return. “People are coming back to find a grave in their garden,” Turbar said. “Perhaps a person driving in a car was stopped by Russians at a checkpoint and they shot him there. Later they let local people bury the body in a nearby house. That wasn’t a single incident, it was systematic.” Some of the bodies that cannot be identified were burned, some partly destroyed by the force of explosions that killed them. Russian soldiers intentionally disfigured the faces of some victims. Other corpses were left in cars or on the street so long that decomposition rendered them unrecognisable, after locals were banned from burying them or too afraid to attempt it as fighting raged. The overwhelming scale of atrocities has led to cruel confusion and bureaucratic layering of pain on top of terrible grief. At the morgue where Yevdokimenko went after seeing the video, he was presented with a single severed leg that workers insisted was all that remained of his father for burial. “They were trying to push a body on me. [Dad’s] cards were in the pocket but I think someone must have taken them,” he said. The trousers and shoe did not belong to his father, he said. When he challenged the workers they admitted that chaos often engulfed their efforts and confided that one body bag they opened this week contained three legs. A small town police force, government and hospital used to dealing with alcoholics, petty thieves and a few dozen deaths a year before Russia’s invasion could hardly have been adequately prepared to handle one of the biggest war crimes investigations of the century. “I am still afraid to walk around because I remember there was a Russian tank here or here. At the very end when they knew that they were leaving, they went street to street just killing everyone, grannies, grandpas, someone who was just sitting outside smoking,” Yevdokimenko said, adding that most of the victims were men. “My classmate, who was 20, was shot because the Russians didn’t like his trousers. There are only women left in my circle [so many of the men were killed].” Despite the scale of the challenge, Turbar says the town is determined to seek justice for the dead, and warn Russian forces still fighting in Ukraine – and reportedly committing fresh atrocities – that they cannot brutalise and murder with impunity. “Emotionally it is very hard to look at these people, some of them I knew before, all the buildings that have been destroyed,” he said. “But I feel an extreme responsibility to the people of Ukraine to collect evidence so we can take [the Russians] to court. “What is happening here is nothing compared to Kharkiv and Mariupol, [the number of atrocities uncovered] are going to get even worse. For Bucha, it is over, but there it is still going on, civilians are still dying.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russian hackers targeting opponents of Ukraine invasion, warns GCHQ chief",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/may/10/russian-hackers-targeting-opponents-of-ukraine-invasion-warns-gchq-chief,2022-05-10T08:58:16Z,"Russian operatives trying to escalate online conflict and seeking targets in countries opposing war, says Jeremy Fleming","Russian hackers are seeking to target western countries supporting Ukraine in its efforts to resist Moscow’s invasion, the head of GCHQ has said. Jeremy Fleming, the director of the British spy agency, said in a speech on Tuesday morning that while fears of a fully fledged online war between Russia and Ukraine had perhaps failed to materialise, there remained “plenty” of cyber activity as part of the conflict. As well as affecting Ukraine directly, there had been “some spillover of activity affecting other countries”, Fleming said, and evidence that Russian actors were trying to escalate the conflict further afield. “We’ve seen indications that Russia’s cyber operatives continue to look for targets in countries that oppose their actions,” the GCHQ chief said. “That’s why we have increased our efforts to ensure UK businesses and government urgently improve levels of cyber resilience.” Fleming did not provide extra evidence, but last month, Britain’s National Cyber Security Agency, an arm of GCHQ, joined forces with its US counterpart, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, in producing an advisory notice warning against a potential Russian escalation. At the time they warned there was a risk some Russian criminal hackers “have recently publicly pledged support for the Russian government” and that they could be willing to engage “in retaliation for perceived cyber offensives against the Russian government or the Russian people”. Russia has been accused of staging more than 200 cyber-attacks on Ukraine since launching its invasion on 24 February, according to an analysis from Microsoft, targeting government agencies and media companies with hacking attempts or destructive malware designed to disable systems. Fleming said the UK, in conjunction with the US and other allies, was engaged in continuing “to support Ukraine in shoring up their cyber defences” – a recognition that the country is the frontline of what could yet spread into an international cyber conflict. Last month, Ukraine said Russian hackers had tried to take out the country’s power grid, and came close to cutting off power for about 2 million people using a variant of the Industroyer malware. Although these attacks were aimed at Ukraine, there remains the risk that such malware could spread uncontrolled. In 2017, Russian state actors launched the NotPetya malware against Ukrainian companies, but it spread indiscriminately around the world, affecting a string of western companies and even some Russian corporations. Western spy agencies have previously said that attack was also conducted by operatives from the GRU, or main intelligence directorate of the Russian army. Fleming also used his speech to highlight that the National Cyber Force (NCF), a new offensive hacker group, run jointly by GCHQ and the Ministry of Defence, was involved in tackling cybercrime. “Through the NCF we are actively undermining the cybercriminals’ assumption that they can act with impunity on the internet. We have disrupted criminals, making it clear that they are being observed, and going after their ability to profit from illegal activities,” he said. The NCF activities have included actions to prevent cybercriminals “from profiting from their crimes” – though it was not spelled out how – and “denying them access to their cyber tools and malware” which are used to carry out attacks. Later this month, Fleming added, Suella Braverman, the attorney general, would set out further details on how far the NCF can go in its efforts to maintain national security. She would “set out the government’s latest legal views on the responsible use of cyber capabilities”, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sixty killed in Russian airstrike on Ukraine school ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/russian-airstrike-ukraine-school,2022-05-08T14:25:52Z,"Rescue attempts impossible due to constant shelling in Bilohorivka, says Luhansk governor","Sixty people have been killed after a village school in eastern Ukraine took a direct hit in a Russian air raid, with rescue attempts said by the regional governor to be impossible due to constant shelling. Russian attacks in the east and south intensified at the weekend ahead of Monday’s symbolic Victory Day celebrations, with the Black Sea city of Odesa coming under repeated missile strikes and the remaining Ukrainian fighters in the Azovstal steelworks in the besieged port city of Mariupol staging a press conference on Sunday saying they had been “abandoned” by the government as Russian attacks continued About 90 people had been using the school in Bilohorivka, a village 60 miles (97km) north-west of the Russian-controlled city of Luhansk, as a shelter after the previous place of refuge, a clubhouse, had been destroyed in an earlier attack. “As a result of a Russian strike on Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region, about 60 people were killed, civilians, who simply hid at the school, sheltering from shelling,” the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in his nightly video address on Sunday. Serhiy Gaidai, the Luhansk governor, told the Guardian he believed the 30 people who escaped had been outside in the grounds of the building. He said he had little hope for those who were under rubble. “Unfortunately, they are probably dead,” he said. “Because the building collapsed. Besides, an air bomb is not a missile, its explosion produces extremely high temperatures. That’s why most likely people haven’t survived.” Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has stated he intends to take the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions by 9 May when Russia marks Victory Day and the defeat of Nazi Germany in the second world war. In an address to mark Ukraine’s 8 May remembrance and reconciliation day, Zelenskiy said his country paid homage to all those who helped defeat Adolf Hitler but accused Russia of repeating his crimes. He said: “Every year on 8 May, together with the entire civilised world, we honour everyone who defended the planet from Nazism during world war two. Millions of lost lives, crippled destinies, tortured souls and millions of reasons to say to evil: never again! “We knew the price our ancestors paid for this wisdom. We knew how important it is to preserve it and pass it on to posterity. But we had no idea that our generation would witness the desecration of the words, which, as it turned out, are not the truth for everyone. “This year we say ‘Never again’ differently. We hear ‘Never again’ differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it.” Zelenskiy went on: “On 24 February, the word ‘never’ was erased. Shot and bombed. By hundreds of missiles at 4am, which woke up the entire Ukraine. We heard terrible explosions. We heard: again!” Illya Samoilenko, a lieutenant in the Azov regiment in Mariupol, said his fellow soldiers would be executed if captured by the Russians and that surrender would be a “gift” to the enemy. “We are witnesses of Russian crimes,” he said, from the city’s Azovstal steelworks. “Surrender is not an option because Russia is not interested in our lives.” Meanwhile, the last civilians rescued from the besieged complex reached safety in Ukrainian held territory late on Sunday evening. The journey of just over 200km took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and those inside interrogated. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and around 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. “I didn’t think we would make it out alive, so I don’t have any plans for my future,” said Natalia, who worked for Azovstal all her adult life and then sheltered for over two month in its network of bunkers. Gaidai said the attack on the school in Bilohorivka had taken place at 6pm on Saturday night and had been followed by a constant barrage in the surrounding area that had made rescue attempts impossible. He said a bus had been sent to the village, which has a population of 800 to 900 people, to evacuate the remaining residents on Sunday morning but it had to turn round due to the ferocity of the shelling on the roads. Gaidai said: “Right now they are asking us, begging us to get them out, but we can’t because everything is now under shelling. Around 70 people wanted to be evacuated today. We sent a bus, but it turned around and went back. Not just the village, but also a highway is under shelling.” Gaidai said he had been frustrated in recent weeks that the residents had repeatedly refused to leave despite the growing dangers to their lives as Russia has focused its attacks in the east and south of Ukraine. Earlier on Saturday, eight miles (13km) north of the school, two children died and a further two children and an elderly woman were injured when a missile hit the village of Pryvole, Gaidai said. He said: “Around a week ago we tried to evacuate around 300 people from Bilohorivka. We’d already settled this, and sent a few buses. But most of them refused to go. So we managed to evacuate only 60-70 people.” Ukraine’s prosecutor general said that as of 8 May, 225 Ukrainian children had died since Russian launched its invasion on 24 February.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This blog has now closed. You can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war in our new live blog in the link below. Here are some of the latest images to come across our newswires today out of Ukraine. The US House of Representatives has approved more than $40bn in aid for Ukraine. The House passed the Ukraine spending bill by 368 to 57 on Tuesday evening, with every ‘no’ vote coming from Republicans, according to a Reuters report. The measure now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act quickly. President Joe Biden had asked Congress to approve an additional $33bn in aid for Ukraine two weeks ago, but lawmakers decided to increase the military and humanitarian funding. “This bill will protect democracy, limit Russian aggression, and strengthen our own national security, while, most importantly, supporting Ukraine,” Democratic Representative Rosa DeLauro, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said. Some Republicans opposed the bill, criticising Democrats for moving too quickly to send too many US taxpayer dollars abroad. Biden’s fellow Democrats narrowly control Congress, but the bill will need Republican votes to get through the Senate. The package includes $6bn for security assistance, including training, equipment, weapons and support; $8.7bn to replenish stocks of US equipment sent to Ukraine, and $3.9bn for European Command operations. In addition, the legislation authorises a further $11bn in Presidential Drawdown Authority, which allows the president to authorise the transfer of articles and services from US stocks without congressional approval in response to an emergency. Biden had asked for $5bn. It also authorizes $4bn in Foreign Military Financing to provide support for Ukraine and other countries affected by the crisis. The United States has so far rushed more than $3.5bn worth of armaments to Ukraine since Russia invaded, including howitzers, anti-aircraft Stinger systems, anti-tank Javelin missiles, ammunition and recently-disclosed ‘Ghost’ drones. Ukrainian forces have retaken villages in the Kharkiv region, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address. The settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske were reportedly retaken from Russian forces in a recovery that could signal a new phase in the war, Zelenskiy added while cautioning against expecting “certain victories”. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. Belarus will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine in response to a “growing threat” by the US and its allies, the armed forces said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles to beef up its military capabilities and warned Belarus could “inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy”. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured. At least 100 civilians remain in Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Russian forces have not reduced the intensity of their attacks on the plant, where civilians and the city’s last Ukrainian defenders are holed up, Petro Andryushchenko said. Ukraine’s Azov Regiment made a plea to the international community for help, saying its soldiers were trapped in “completely unsanitary conditions, with open wounds” and “without the necessary medication and even food”. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden. Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building in the north-east of the country that was destroyed weeks ago. The bodies were found in a five-storey building that collapsed in March in Izium, about 120km (75 miles) from the city of Kharkiv. US lawmakers in the House of Representatives approved more than $40 billion more aid for Ukraine on Tuesday. The legislation is set to go the US Senate where it is expected to pass. Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine, potentially triggering his resort to using a nuclear weapon, the US director of national intelligence has said. Avril Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. The UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly on Tuesday for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the world organisation’s leading human rights body following its suspension over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point which it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reports. Russia’s Gazprom said this would be “technologically impossible”. Four Russian regional governors reportedly resigned on Tuesday as the country braces for the impact of economic sanctions. The heads of the Tomsk, Saratov, Kirov and Mari El regions announced their immediate departures from office, while the head of Ryazan region said he would not run for another term. Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision Song Contest. At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group thanked viewers for supporting Ukraine amid the Russian invasion. The number of Ukrainians who have fled their country since Russia’s invasion on 24 February is approaching 6 million, according to the United Nations. The UN General Assembly voted overwhelmingly Tuesday for the Czech Republic to replace Russia on the world organisation’s leading human rights body following its suspension over allegations of horrific rights violations by Russian soldiers in Ukraine. In Tuesday’s secret ballot vote, 180 of the General Assembly’s 193 members deposited ballots. The result was 157 countries in favour of the Czech Republic and 23 abstentions, the Associated Press reports. The assembly approved a US-initiated resolution on 7 April to suspend Russia from the Human Rights Council by a vote of 93-24 with 58 abstentions. Rescuers say they have found the bodies of 44 civilians under the rubble of a destroyed building in the eastern Ukrainian town of Izyum, now under Russian control. “The bodies of 44 civilians were found in Izyum under the rubble of a five-storey building which was destroyed by the occupiers in early March,” Oleg Synegubov, governor of the eastern Kharkiv region, said in an update via the Telegram messaging app. Although fighting continues in the area, local media quoted him as saying residents had made the discovery while clearing the rubble from an area “where there is no shelling”, according to a report from Agence France-Presse. Synegubov did not say who had removed the bodies nor how they had managed to do so. Separately, the regional prosecutor’s office said it had opened an investigation into “the violation of the laws and customs of war” following the discovery, saying that 14 of the bodies had already been identified. “According to the investigation, the Russian military systematically shelled Izyum between March 7-10. As a result, public infrastructure and residential buildings were destroyed,” it said on Telegram. Ukraine has been voted through to the grand final in the Eurovision Song Contest. At the end of their semi-final performance, the folk-rap group thanked everyone for supporting their country amid the Russian invasion. The group had been unable to meet and rehearse regularly and were only able to get together about six weeks before Tuesday night’s performance. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills, who was commentating for the BBC coverage of the semi-final, said: “Frontman Oleg joked that he doesn’t think the lack of rehearsal time will affect their performance because they’re very attractive men.” The Ukrainian act is the favourite to win. The competition’s producers previously announced Russia will no longer participate in this year’s contest following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. As Russian troops continue their assault of the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol, a photo-journalist has revealed the extent of the suffering and life for those wounded who remain inside. In a series of harrowing images, a photographer with the press office of the Azov Special Forces Regiment of the Ukrainian National Guard has unveiled the horror of the dimly-lit, makeshift ‘hospitals’ inside the plant where soldiers receive treatment, many for lost limbs. A Ukrainian soldier inside the besieged Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has spoken of the harrowing conditions from inside the plant, revealing the remaining defenders are “taking heavy casualties” as the Russians continue their assault. Lieutenant Illya Samoilenko, a member of the Azov Regiment, told Sky News that the count of injured and fallen soldiers is “very high” and the servicemen deserve proper care. Nobody has been expecting for us to hold against the Russians for so long but still we are fighting. We’re taking heavy casualties, we’re taking losses.” Ukrainian officials believe around 100 civilians remain at the site, but Samoilenko said that, as far as he knows, they were all evacuated. He added that those at the site have “extremely limited resources,” and they believe that “every day may be our last”. “The result of this might be... [being captured] by the enemy, which means death for us,” he added. “Our life means nothing, but our fight means everything.” Ukrainian soldiers have shown the squalid conditions in which they are currently living while trapped and wounded holed up under the Azovstal steel works plant in besieged Mariupol. A series of photos were published on the Azov Regiment’s Telegram channel early this morning, alongside a plea to the international community for help. The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act! In completely unsanitary conditions, with open wounds bandaged with non-sterile remnants of bandages, without the necessary medication and even food. We call on the UN and the Red Cross to show their humanity and reaffirm the basic principles on which you were created by rescuing wounded people who are no longer combatants. The servicemen you see in the photo and hundreds more at the Azovstal plant defended Ukraine and the entire civilised world with serious injuries at the cost of their own health. Are Ukraine and the world community now unable to protect and take care of them?” The regiment pleaded for the “immediate evacuation of wounded servicemen to Ukrainian-controlled territories” where they could be assisted and provided with proper care. Returning to the decisive issue of gas, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov visited gas-producing ally Algeria for talks on Tuesday as Europe scrambles to secure alternative energy supplies. Algeria is a major gas supplier to Europe, providing 11% of its imports, compared with 47% from Russia, according to figures cited by the Associated Press. Italy, Spain and other European Union member countries have looked to Algeria as they seek to cut their dependence on Russian oil and gas. However, Algeria has repeatedly stressed that it lacks the capacity to meet such demand in the short-term. “We very much appreciate Algeria’s considered, objective and balanced position on the Ukrainian question,” Lavrov told journalists after meeting his counterpart Ramtane Lamamra and President Abdelmadjid Tebboune. Asked about Algeria’s gas deliveries, Lavrov said that Russia, Algeria and other gas exporters “believe we should respect deals that have already been reached”. Lavrov added that the two sides had discussed “bolstering military and technical cooperation”. Footage from the chaos inflicted on Odesa after one person was killed and five injured when seven missiles hit a shopping centre and a depot in Odesa has emerged showing burning buildings and rescue workers sorting through debris. Air raid sirens sounded as the missiles interrupted a meeting between Charles Michel, president of the European Council, and the Ukrainian prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, forcing them into a bomb shelter on Monday. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and prevent a global food crisis. Watch the footage below. Ukraine has said it will suspend the flow of gas through a transit point which it says delivers almost a third of the fuel piped from Russia to Europe through Ukraine, blaming Moscow for the move and saying it would move the flows elsewhere. Ukraine has remained a major transit route for Russian gas to Europe even throughout Russia’s war in Ukraine. GTSOU, which operates Ukraine’s gas system, said it would stop shipments via the Sokhranivka route from Wednesday, declaring “force majeure”, a clause invoked when a business is hit by something beyond its control, Reuters reports. But Gazprom, which has a monopoly on Russian gas exports by pipeline, said it was “technologically impossible” to shift all volumes to the Sudzha interconnection point further west, as GTSOU proposed. GTSOU CEO Sergiy Makogon told Reuters that Russian occupying forces had started taking gas transiting through Ukraine and sending it to two Russia-backed separatist regions in the country’s east. He did not cite evidence. The company said it could not operate at the Novopskov gas compressor station due to “the interference of the occupying forces in technical processes”, adding it could temporarily shift the affected flow to the Sudzha physical interconnection point located in territory controlled by Ukraine. Ukraine’s suspension of Russian natural gas flows through the Sokhranivka route should not have an impact on the domestic Ukrainian market, state energy firm Naftogaz head Yuriy Vitrenko told Reuters. The state gas company in Moldova, a small nation on Ukraine’s western border, said it had not received any notice from GTSOU or Gazprom that supplies would be interrupted. Belarus will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine in response to a “growing threat” by the US and its allies, the armed forces said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles to beef up its military capabilities. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured. At least 100 civilians remain in Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Russian forces have not reduced the density of their attacks on the plant, where civilians and the city’s last Ukrainian defenders are holed up, Petro Andryushchenko said. Ukrainian officials said they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building in the north-east of the country that was destroyed weeks ago. The bodies were found in a five-story building that collapsed in March in Izium, about 120km (75 miles) from the city of Kharkiv. Ukrainian forces have recaptured villages in north and north-east of Kharkiv, according to Ukrainian officials. Settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske were retaken from Russian forces, signalling a potential shift in the war wherein Ukraine could start going on the offensive. Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, said Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine. Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. US lawmakers in the House of Representatives are expected to vote on Tuesday evening on a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. The legislation will then go to the US Senate, where sufficient support is not quite yet in the bag.However, there is broad bipartisan support for firm US backing of Ukraine following the invasion by Russia in late February. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, visited areas around Kyiv devastated by the war on a surprise visit to Ukraine. In a press conference, Baerbock said Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union at some point but that there could be no shortcut to membership. France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. Clément Beaune, an ally of Macron and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, spoke in a call on Tuesday. The two heads of state “reiterated their commitment to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” the Élysée said. Chinese state media said Xi warned Macron that confrontation between blocs resulting from the Ukraine crisis could become a bigger and more lasting threat to global peace than the crisis itself. Russia has been blamed for a massive cyber-attack against a satellite internet network an hour before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The digital attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT network in late February took thousands of modems offline and helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of the country, the Council of the EU said. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden. Italian prime minister Mario Draghi visited US president Joe Biden at the White House, expressing the desire for negotiations to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. He also reiterated Italian support for EU sanctions on Russia’s energy sector. The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned.Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. In his nightly address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the death of Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of Ukraine, and emphasized news that Ukrainian forces were beginning to retake some villages. “I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength,” he said. “But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions.” – Guardian staff In his address, Zelenskiy also emphasized news that Ukrainian forces have retaken villages in the Kharkiv region, which could signal a new phase in the war. He also cautioned against expecting “certain victories”. He said: The Armed Forces of our state provided us all with good news from the Kharkiv region. The occupiers are gradually being pushed away from Kharkiv. I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders. Once the second most powerful army in the world. But I also want to urge all our people, and especially those in the rear, not to spread excessive emotions. We shouldn’t create an atmosphere of specific moral pressure, when certain victories are expected weekly and even daily. The Armed Forces of Ukraine are doing everything to liberate our land and our people. To liberate all our cities - Kherson, Melitopol, Berdyansk, Mariupol and all others. Masha Alekhina, a member of Pussy Riot, escaped from Russia by disguising herself as a food courier, the New York Times reports. Alekhina has been put under house arrest, but as the Kremlin sought to crack down on critics of the Ukraine war, her sentence was ordered to be carred out at a penal colony. The Times reports: She decided it was time to leave Russia — at least temporarily — and disguised herself as a food courier to evade the Moscow police who had been staking out the friend’s apartment where she was staying. She left her cellphone behind as a decoy and to avoid being tracked. A friend drove her to the border with Belarus, and it took her a week to cross into Lithuania. In a studio apartment in Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, she agreed to an interview to describe a dissident’s harrowing escape from Mr. Putin’s Russia. “I was happy that I made it, because it was an unpredictable and big” kiss-off to the Russian authorities, Ms. Alyokhina said, using a less polite term. “I still don’t understand completely what I’ve done,” she admitted, dressed in black except for a fanny pack with a rainbow belt. Her lawyer told the TASS news agency, “ I don’t know how she managed to do this, given the close surveillance that law enforcement agencies organized for her.” Thousands have fled Russia since the war began, as Russian president Vladimir Putin moved to crack down increasingly on those speaking out against the invasion. In his nightly address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addressed the death of Leonid Kravchuk, the first president of Ukraine. He said: He was not just a politician. And not just a historical figure. He was the man who knew how to find wise words and say them so that all Ukrainians could hear them. This is especially important in difficult, crisis moments. When the future of an entire country may depend on the wisdom of one person. Leonid Makarovych showed just such wisdom in the late 1980s, when the Ukrainian movement emerged. He passed 1991 brilliantly, and it is only now that it may seem as if it was easy for him then. And no matter what happened later, Leonid Kravchuk always stayed with Ukraine. Perhaps it was because of his wisdom that he was cheerful in a special way. He always valued life, every minute of it. But he always found much more than one minute to help sort things out and give advice. And I am personally grateful to him in particular for that. As a child he survived World War II, survived the occupation. Leonid Makarovych knew what freedom costs. And with all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine. I’m sure we will implement it. We will achieve our victory and our peace. Read more: The longer the war in Ukraine carries on, the worse the consequences will be for the climate, the US presidential envoy John Kerry has warned. Many countries are struggling with an energy crisis while also urgently needing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to limit global heating to 1.5C, he said. “If it’s a long period of time, obviously that makes [staying within 1.5C] very complicated,” Kerry said. “It depends on what happens with the war, where the war goes and how long it lasts. If miraculously we can somehow find a way to resolve some of the fundamental problems in the next six months, then maybe we could just accelerate everything together. I think we can make up some distance [in progress on tackling the climate crisis].” But he added: “The longer this goes on, the harder it becomes [to stay within 1.5C]. There are a number of scientists who believe we are on the edge of 1.5C now. Anything that is not part of the acceleration [of emissions-cutting efforts] gets in the way.” He said the agreement reached at the UN Cop26 climate summit last year would have “faced some big hurdles” if taking place in the current geopolitical circumstances, but there was still a chance of fulfilling its promises. “This is not easy, but it hasn’t fallen apart,” he told the Guardian. “[The effort to stay within 1.5C] has met with an unexpected barrier, the war, and it has met with an unfortunate and dangerous resurgence of business as usual by some parties that threatens the acceleration necessary to get the job done, and it’s going to be up to us to push back and continue with the process.” The world’s leading climate scientists recently warned it was “now or never” for the world to cut greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst ravages of the climate crisis. Kerry said this showed there was still a chance of holding to the 1.5C goal. “The IPCC said to us a few weeks ago ‘we’re behind, it’s not getting better at the pace it should be, emissions have gone up, but you still have time to do this’,” he said. “And my message to people is we have to take advantage of the fact that the science tells us we still have time, but we have to greatly accelerate what we’re doing. We have to speed up very significantly.” Read more: US lawmakers in the House of Representatives are expected to vote on Tuesday evening on a $40 billion aid package for Ukraine. The legislation will then go to the US Senate, where sufficient support is not quite yet in the bag. However, there is broad bipartisan support for firm US backing of Ukraine following the invasion by Russia in late February. The defense, humanitarian and economic funding should pass comfortably, with the two parties having reached an agreement on the details, and it will likely move quickly through Congress, AFP writes. Time is of the essence - and we cannot afford to wait. With this aid package, America sends a resounding message to the world of our unwavering determination to stand with the courageous people of Ukraine until victory is won,” House speaker and California Democrat Nancy Pelosi wrote in a letter to her party colleagues on Capitol Hill. Congressional leaders struck a deal Monday to release $6.8 billion more than the $33 billion previously requested by the White House to help the Eastern European nation ward off Moscow’s invasion. The financial boost would include an extra $3.4 billion for both military and humanitarian assistance on top of the funding requested by the administration. If the package passes as planned, US spending to bolster Ukraine’s defenses against Russia’s invasion and address the ensuing humanitarian crisis will soar to around $54 billion. The action comes as a top US official warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war that may not end with Russian victory in the east. Pelosi met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy on a visit to Kyiv at the start of this month. The blog will now hand over from the New York team to California, where my colleague Maanvi Singh is poised to take you through the next few hours. Italian prime minister Mario Draghi has made further remarks upon his visit to US president Joe Biden at the White House, expressing the desire for negotiations to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. He thanked Biden for his hospitality in Washington, then turned his remarks to Russia’s invasion of its southern neighbour. Here is a report from the White House reporting pool. Hopefully the snippet that was inaudible will be filled in later. Draghi said: The ties between our two countries have always been strong, and if anything this war in Ukraine made them stronger. Putin thought he could divide us. We stand together condemning the invasion of Ukraine, sanctioning Russia. But I have to tell you that in Italy and in Europe now, people want to see an end to these massacres, this violence, this butchery. And people think about what can we do to bring peace. We certainly have to use any direct (inaudible), but it’s not enough? What can we do? People want to think about the possibility of bringing a ceasefire and start engaging in credible negotiations. That’s the situation right now. I think we have to think deeply about how to address this. We will continue to work on energy security, food security especially which is another issue about which we’ll talk later about what to do. The other thing I will say - I don’t think we’ll discuss this later - but what happens in Ukraine is going to bring a drastic change in European unity. We’ve always been close. Now, we’re going to be much closer. I know I can count on your support as a true friend of Europe and of Italy, of course.” Here are some more images from Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa, which came under repeated attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. There has been severe damage. Ukrainian first responders have been working in the rubble. Smoke still rises a day after the shelling in Odesa. Italian prime minister Mario Draghi and US president Joe Biden stressed transatlantic unity on responding to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, at the White House on Tuesday, Agence France-Presse reports. The ties between our two countries will always be strong and, if anything, this war in Ukraine has made them stronger. [Vladimir Putin] thought he could divide us. He failed, we stand together,” Draghi told Biden. Biden, who hosted Draghi in the Oval Office, echoed the sentiment, referring in comments to the Russian president while reporters were present. Putin believed he could split us, but we’ve all stepped up,” Biden said. Despite Italy’s dependence on Russian gas and Rome’s traditionally friendly ties with Moscow, Draghi’s government has been a staunch supporter of efforts to punish Russia for its assault on Ukraine. Along with western allies, Rome has sent weapons to support Kyiv, although there is increasing unease about the move within Draghi’s national unity government. Draghi has also pledged support for any European Union sanctions on Russia’s energy sector despite the risks – 40% of Italy’s natural gas imports come from Russia. The European Union is currently debating a phased ban on Russian oil imports, although this move would not touch Moscow’s huge gas exports. With fierce fighting between invading Russian forces and Ukrainian military across a long stretch of Ukraine, there are losses and gains for each side as the advantage fluctuates in different places. As the vital Black Sea port of Odesa is pounded by Russian missiles, further north in the Kharkiv region Ukrainian officials are talking of having recaptured some territory. Here are some images coming out from Kharkiv, near the central eastern border with Russia. The contrast between spring sunshine, trees with fresh greenery and a certain tranquility belie what has been fierce fighting and destruction in Kharkiv and surrounding villages. News wires journalists and photographers have captured graphic shots of dead Russian soldiers, which we will refrain from sharing here, but which bolster Ukrainian claims they are making some headway in resisting the Russian advance in that area.

 had recaptured villages from Russian troops north and north-east of Kharkiv, pressing a counter-offensive that could signal a shift in the war’s momentum and jeopardise Russia’s main advance, Reuters reports on Tuesday. Tetiana Apatchenko, press officer for the 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, in the country’s east, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Defence ministry adviser Yuriy Saks said the successes were pushing Russian forces out of range of Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city and located in the north-east, which has been under perpetual bombardment since the war began. The military operations of the Ukrainian armed forces around Kharkiv, especially north and north-east of Kharkiv, are sort of a success story. The Ukrainian army was able to push these war criminals to a line beyond the reach of their artillery,” Saks told Reuters. US officials are now talking about a stalemate. But the counterattack near Kharkiv could signal a new phase, with Ukraine now going on the offensive after weeks in which Russia mounted a massive assault without making a breakthrough. By pushing back Russian forces who had occupied the outskirts of Kharkiv since the start of the invasion, the Ukrainians are moving into striking distance of the rear supply lines sustaining the main Russian attack force further south. They’re trying to cut in and behind the Russians to cut off the supply lines, because that’s really one of their (the Russians’) main weaknesses. Ukrainians are getting close to the Russian border. So all the gains that the Russians made in the early days in the noerth-east of Ukraine are increasingly slipping away,” said Neil Melvin of the RUSI thinktank in London. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Belarus will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine in response to a “growing threat” by the US and its allies, the armed forces said. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles to beef up its military capabilities. The US believes that Russia is about two weeks behind schedule in its invasion of Ukraine’s Donbas region as well as the south of the country, according to a senior US defence official. The US assesses that Putin has not achieved any of his strategic goals so far in the Donbas or in Ukraine, and that his focus remains on the Donbas, the official said. Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles.

The first president of independent Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has died after a long illness, local news has reported. Ukrainian MP Dmitry Razumkov said Kravchuk, who served as president from 1991 to 1994, was “a figure who stood at the origins of modern Ukrainian statehood”. Ukrainian presidential adviser Anton Gerashchenko tweeted that Kravchuk was “a historic figure and played a huge part in Ukraine becoming independent peacefully”. From our Isobel Koshiw: Four Russian regional governors resigned today as the country braces for the impact of economic sanctions, Reuters reports. The heads of the Tomsk, Saratov, Kirov and Mari El regions announced their immediate departures from office, while the head of Ryazan region said he would not run for another term. Elections for all five regions are scheduled to take place in September. Russian regional governors are elected but are politically subordinate to the Kremlin. Unpopular governors are regularly removed from office. Several of the outgoing governors represent regions where the ruling bloc United Russia took weak vote shares in parliamentary elections last year. From András Tóth-Czifra, a political analyst at the Center for European Policy Analysis: The Kremlin is removing weak governors amid a worsening economic outlook for Russia, driven by western sanctions, according to Ilya Grashchenkov, head of the Centre for the Development of Regional Politics thinktank in Moscow. Grashchenkov said: There’s a need to restructure the economy, especially in those regions where western economic influence had been significant. These governors need to be replaced by younger alternatives. Russia’s economy ministry has said that the economy is set to contract by 8.8% in 2022. The US believes that Russia is about two weeks behind schedule in its invasion of Ukraine’s Donbas region as well as the south of the country, according to a senior US defence official. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said: We would assess that he’s [Vladimir Putin] easily two weeks or even maybe more behind ... where he thought he wanted to be in the Donbas and in the south. The US assesses that Putin has not achieved any of his strategic goals so far in the Donbas or in Ukraine, and that his focus remains on the Donbas, the official said. From Foreign Policy’s Jack Detsch: When the war started journalists in Ukraine found themselves at the centre of the biggest story in the world. They became war correspondents overnight. Ukrainian journalists were spotlighted this week when the Pulitzer prize board awarded them with a special citation, hailing the country’s reporters for the “courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting” they have shown since the Russian invasion. But initially, writing stories and making television reports was secondary for the reporters, editors, and producers who heard explosions around them and scrambled for safety. For more than a month many Ukrainian journalists focused on survival. Some have since returned to work, but often they lack protective equipment and hostile environment training. “Lots of journalists left Kyiv,” said Kristina Berdynskykh, a journalist at one of Ukraine’s major independent publications, Novoye Vremya. “They weren’t thinking about whether they’d be fired, they were just thinking that they had to get their families out.” After the first few days almost all of the staff of Ukraine’s prominent newsrooms fled westwards to Lviv where many remain. Lviv quickly became the new temporary capital when Russian forces surrounded Kyiv. “From the print journalists I know, there was maybe a handful left in Kyiv,” said Berdynskykh. “It is mostly the TV stations who had small teams of war correspondents who had experience in the Donbas. For everyone else, the situation was an absolute shock.” Those who stayed in Ukraine’s hotspots embarked on new careers. Berdynskykh spent 18 nights sleeping on the floor in Kyiv’s metro to avoid the shelling and conducted phone interviews. Without a car or taxis, and with shells flying into the city, in-person interviews were near to impossible for the first month she said. “At first it was practically just western journalists – war correspondents – doing on-the-ground reporting,” said Berdynskykh, who was a leading political reporter but is now focusing on the experiences of ordinary Ukrainians around the country. “But I’m grateful to them because we were still adapting.” Read Isobel Koshiw’s full article here: ‘I had to act’: How Ukrainian journalists became war correspondents overnight Belarus will deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine in response to a “growing threat” by the US and its allies, the armed forces said, as the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles. The Belarusian chief of general staff, Viktor Gulevich, said: The United States and its allies continue to build up their military presence on the state borders of Belarus. The strength of this force has more than doubled in the last six months. He said the build-up of military presence by western allies “testifies to a growing threat to the Republic of Belarus”, adding that Belarus is also deploying air defence, artillery and missile units for drills in the west. The announcement comes after Lukashenko earlier today said Moscow had agreed to help Minsk produce missiles to beef up its military capabilities. Speaking at a meeting of defence officials, Lukashenko was quoted by the state-run news agency Belta as saying that events in Ukraine had demonstrated the importance of having troops with modern, highly effective weapons and supplies. Lukashenko said he won the support of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for people involved in missile production in Russia to take a look at Belarus’s developments in that area. He said the Belarusian army was combat-ready and will be able to “inflict unacceptable damage on the enemy” in case of external aggression, adding: We are realists, we understand that we will not be able to defeat Nato. However, we have all the weapons to do damage, especially to the territories from which we will be attacked. The Belarusian president said he was “not hinting at anything, but I want everyone to understand the range of the weapons we have”. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country has said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured but the UN’s Matilda Bogner said places such as Mariupol were still a “black hole” in the UN’s data collection, but thousands more would be added to the official death toll once verified. Russia’s war in Ukraine is at a “bit of a stalemate”, Lt Gen Scott Berrier, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, told the US Senate armed services committee. Berrier said: The Russians aren’t winning and the Ukrainians aren’t winning and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here. He added that so far, between eight and 10 Russian generals have been killed in the war. Asked about the prospect of Putin using tactical nuclear weapons, Berrier said: Right now, we do not see that. It is almost 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s vital Black Sea port of Odesa came under repeated missile attack, including from some hypersonic missiles. One person was killed and five were wounded after seven Russian missiles hit a shopping centre and depot on Monday, the military said. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said.

Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, said Vladimir Putin will “turn to more drastic means” to achieve his objectives in Ukraine. Haines told the Senate armed services committee that the Russian president was “preparing for prolonged conflict” in Ukraine and that his strategic goals have “probably not changed”. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, visited areas around Kyiv devastated by the war on a surprise visit to Ukraine. In a press conference, Baerbock said Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union at some point but that there could be no shortcut to membership. France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. Clément Beaune, an ally of Macron and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. China’s president, Xi Jinping, and his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, spoke in a call on Tuesday. The two heads of state “reiterated their commitment to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” the Élysée said. Chinese state media said Xi warned Macron that confrontation between blocs resulting from the Ukraine crisis could become a bigger and more lasting threat to global peace than the crisis itself. Russia has been blamed for a massive cyber-attack against a satellite internet network an hour before Vladimir Putin ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The digital attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT network in late February took thousands of modems offline and helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of the country, the Council of the EU said. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, will visit Finland and Sweden on Wednesday, as the two Nordic countries consider whether to apply for Nato membership in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Downing Street said Johnson would have discussions on “broader security issues” during his visit to Finland followed by Sweden. A spokesperson for the PM said: It is about not just Ukraine but the security of Europe more broadly. This is about meeting other democratic countries and discussing issues such as security which are of importance here and overseas. We support countries’ democratic capability to decide on things like Nato membership. We understand the positions of Sweden and Finland and that is why the prime minister is going to discuss these broader security issues. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, said Ukraine should become a full member of the European Union at some point but that there could be no shortcut to membership. Speaking alongside her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, Baerbock stressed that Germany would reduce its imports of Russian energy to zero, “and that will stay that way forever”. Haines also addressed the threat that the war in Ukraine could turn nuclear. In general, US intelligence believes Moscow could make the threats more explicit, but would not use nuclear weapons if he does not believe his regime is at risk. Haines said: We believe that Moscow continues to use nuclear rhetoric to deter the United States and the west from increasing lethal aid to Ukraine and to respond to public comments from the US and Nato allies that suggest expanded western goals in the conflict. And if Putin perceives that the United States is ignoring his threats, he may try to signal to Washington the heightened danger of its support to Ukraine by authorising another large nuclear exercise involving a major dispersal of mobile intercontinental missiles, heavy bombers and strategic submarines. We otherwise continue to believe that President Putin would probably only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if he perceived an existential threat to the Russian state or regime. But we will remain vigilant and monitor every aspect of Russia’s strategic nuclear forces. With tensions this high, there is always an enhanced potential for miscalculation, unintended escalation, which we hope our intelligence can help to mitigate. In the question and answer session of the Senate hearing, Haines went into more detail on perceptions on when Putin would go nuclear, and in particular what would constitute an existential threat for the Russian leader. She said that might not just be fear of an attack on Russia, but also fear of defeat in Ukraine. We do think that could be the case in the event that he perceives that he is losing the war in Ukraine, and that Nato in effect is either intervening or about to intervene in that context, which would obviously contribute to a perception that he is about to lose the war in Ukraine. But there are a lot of things that he would do in the context of escalation before he would get to nuclear weapons and also that he would be likely to engage in some signaling beyond what he’s done thus far before doing so. More from Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, who said that the Ukraine war is becoming a war of attrition with no end in sight. Haines said: Putin most likely judges that Russia has a greater ability and willingness to endure challenges than his adversaries and he is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse. Moreover, as both Russia and Ukraine believe they can continue to make progress militarily, we do not see a viable negotiating path forward at least in the short term. The uncertain nature of the battle which is developing into a war of attrition, combined with the reality that Putin faces a mismatch between his ambitions and Russia’s current conventional military capabilities, likely means the next few months could see us moving along a more unpredictable and potentially escalatory trajectory. The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means, including imposing martial law, reorienting industrial production, or potentially escalatory military actions to free up the resources needed to achieve his objectives as the conflict drags on, or if he perceives Russia is losing in Ukraine. The most likely flashpoint for escalation in the coming weeks is around increasing Russian attempts to intimidate western security assistance, retaliation for western economic sanctions or threats to the regime at home. Avril Haines, the US director of national intelligence, has been testifying to the Senate armed services committee on worldwide threats and has had some interesting things to say about the Ukraine war. It is a pretty grim outlook. Haines said: We assess President Putin is preparing for prolonged conflict in Ukraine during which he still intends to achieve goals beyond the Donbas. We assess that Putin’s strategic goals have probably not changed, suggesting he regards the decision in late March to refocus Russian forces on the Donbas is only a temporary shift to regain the initiative. She said Putin’s short-run military goals are to capture the two oblasts of Donetsk and Luhansk plus a buffer zone around them, and encircle Ukrainian forces in that part of the country from the north to consolidate control over a land bridge to Crimea, and to hold Kherson oblast, where Crimea’s water comes from. US intelligence also sees indications that Putin wants to extend the land bridge all the way over to Transnistria, the Moscow-occupied region of Moldova, thereby controlling all of Ukraine’s Black Sea coast. Haines thinks Putin will face an uphill task to achieve all those objectives, however. While the Russian forces may be capable of achieving most of these near term goals in the coming months, we believe that they will not be able to extend control over a land bridge that stretches to Transnistria and includes Odesa without launching some form of mobilisation and it is increasingly unlikely that they will be able to establish control over both oblasts [Donetsk and Luhansk] and the buffer zone they desire in the coming weeks. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has posted to his Telegram channel that he had a “meaningful meeting” with the foreign ministers of Germany and the Netherlands, Annalena Baerbock and Wopke Hoekstra. Zelenskiy said: “Support from your countries is important and valuable to us. Thank you for being in solidarity with the Ukrainian people today.” Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko has posted to Telegram that the cost of renovating buildings in Ukraine’s capital following Russian attacks will amount to €70m (£60m / $74m). He said: As a result of Russia’s military aggression, a total of 390 buildings in the Ukrainian capital were damaged. 222 of them are apartment buildings. We have already identified 20 apartment blocks where restoration work should begin first. So that people could return to your homes soon. The shelling and bombing of the city damaged 75 educational institutions, 30 of which were preschools, 17 healthcare facilities, 11 cultural facilities. As may have been anticipated, the diplomatic readout from China of the call between President Xi Jinping and Emmanuel Macron differs slightly from the emphasis in the French readout. Reuters reports that Chinese state media say Xi warned Macron that confrontation between blocs resulting from the Ukraine crisis could become a bigger and more lasting threat to global peace than the crisis itself. China has repeatedly urged European countries to exercise diplomatic autonomy instead of aligning with the United States in what Beijing says is a “cold war mentality”, and has not condemned Russia for its latest invasion of Ukraine. On a more positive diplomatic note, Chinese state media also say that Xi told Macron he hoped France will play an active role in promoting China-EU ties as it holds the presidency of the EU. The French side have offered a diplomatic readout of a call between France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping. Reuters reports that the communique from the Élysée presidential office said that subjects discussed included the situation in Ukraine and the worldwide food crisis resulting from the war. “The two heads of state reiterated their commitment to respect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine,” the Élysée said. China has not yet commented on the call. France has said a deal on a proposed EU ban on Russian oil could be struck this week, despite opposition from the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, who has compared the plans to an atomic bomb. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, is due to hold a phone call with the Hungarian leader later on Tuesday in a bid to break the deadlock. Clément Beaune, an ally of Macron and France’s Europe minister, said he thought “we could strike a deal this week”. Meanwhile, Ursula von der Leyen said there had been progress after making a last-minute dash to Budapest to discuss the plans with Orbán on Monday night. The European Commission president described the discussion as “helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security”. She added: “We made progress, but further work is needed,” promising to hold a video conference with other countries in the region to boost cooperation on oil infrastructure. EU diplomats insist all 27 member states are united behind the idea of a ban on Russian oil, with sources close to the talks describing the delay as technical rather than political. But the EU had hoped to announce the oil embargo and a new set of sanctions on influential Russians before last weekend, following Von der Leyen’s presentation of the plans at the European parliament last Wednesday. Lithuania’s parliament voted unanimously to describe Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “genocide” and “terrorism” and called for an international tribunal to prosecute suspected war crimes. The motion said Russian forces’ war crimes included the deliberate killing of civilians, mass rape, forcible relocation of Ukrainian citizens to Russia and the destruction of economic infrastructure and cultural sites, Reuters reports. The Lithuanian parliamentary motion, co-sponsored by the prime minister, Ingrida Šimonytė, read: The Russian Federation, whose military forces deliberately and systematically select civilian targets for bombing, is a state that supports and perpetrates terrorism. It follows a similar unanimous vote by Canadian lawmakers last month to call Russia’s attacks in Ukraine a “genocide”. Britain, the EU and the US have publicly blamed Russia for a massive cyber-attack against a satellite internet network an hour before the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered his troops to invade Ukraine. The digital attack on Viasat’s KA-SAT network in late February took thousands of modems offline and helped facilitate Putin’s invasion of the country, the Council of the EU said in a statement. The cyber-attack had a “significant impact” and caused “indiscriminate communication outages and disruptions across several public authorities, businesses and users in Ukraine, as well as affecting several EU member states”, the statement said, adding: This unacceptable cyber-attack is yet another example of Russia’s continued pattern of irresponsible behaviour in cyberspace, which also formed an integral part of its illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. The UK’s national cyber security centre has assessed that Russian military intelligence was almost certainly involved in the 13 January attacks on Ukrainian government websites, as well as the subsequent attack impacting Viasat on 24 February. Britain’s foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said Russia would face “severe consequences” for its “malign behaviour and unprovoked aggression” across land, sea and cyberspace, adding: This is clear and shocking evidence of a deliberate and malicious attack by Russia against Ukraine which had significant consequences on ordinary people and businesses in Ukraine and across Europe. Russia routinely denies it carries out offensive cyber operations. The UN’s migration agency said more than 8 million people had been internally displaced in Ukraine since Russia began its invasion on 24 February. The figures, published in a report by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), represent a 24% increase compared with the first internal displacement figures published on 16 March. Nearly half of those people were considering further relocation due to the humanitarian crisis in the country, the report said. More than 2.7 million people have returned home. The survey highlights financial support as the overwhelming need among people who have been internally displaced in Ukraine. Two-thirds of people identified cash assistance as one of their needs, compared with 49% at the beginning of the war. More than 70% said they would use that cash assistance to buy food or medicine. Russia will not be taking part in a special session of the UN’s human rights council on Ukraine, the foreign ministry said. The council announced yesterday that it would hold a special session to examine “the deteriorating human rights situation in Ukraine stemming from the Russian aggression”. More than 50 countries, including Britain, Germany, Turkey and the US backed the request by Kyiv and demanded an extraordinary meeting of the UN’s top rights body. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said the Russian delegation “will not legitimise with its presence this new political show organised under the guise of an extraordinary session”. In a statement, Zakharova said: Unfortunately, our arguments and explanations on the true objectives of this special military operation and the real situation on the ground have been completely ignored. She said it was “evident” that Russia’s arguments “will not be heard this time either” during the west’s “new anti-Russian measure”. A recent rise in dolphin deaths in the Black Sea may have been caused by the war in Ukraine, scientists have said, Selin Uğurtaş reports. Researchers believe heightened noise pollution in the northern Black Sea, caused by about 20 Russian navy vessels and ongoing military activities, may have been driving cetaceans south to Turkish and Bulgarian shores, where they are being stranded or caught in fishing nets in unusually high numbers. Since the beginning of the war, Turkey has recorded a rise in strandings of the common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) across its Black Sea coast. More than 80 of the animals were found dead across the country’s western Black Sea, which the Turkish Marine Research Foundation (Tudav) described as “an extraordinary increase”. Initial investigations by Tudav revealed about half of these dolphins were killed after getting entangled in fishing nets. The fate of the other half, however, is still an “unanswered question”, according to Dr Bayram Öztürk, the chair of Tudav, as no signs of entanglement or gunshot wounds could be found on the carcasses. “Acoustic trauma is one of the possibilities that come to mind,” Öztürk said, although he stressed it was important to remain cautious. “We don’t have proof on what low frequency sonar may cause in the Black Sea because we have never seen this many ships, and this much noise for such an extended time – and science always demands proof.” Navies commonly rely on sonar to detect enemy submarines from great distances. Because marine mammals also depend on sound for communication and other functions, the underwater noise can have serious, even fatal, effects on cetaceans. According to Dr Pavel Gol’din, a researcher at Ukraine’s National Academy of Sciences, while acoustic trauma may explain the strandings, constant underwater noise caused by military activities could explain the higher bycatch rate. Germany’s foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and her Dutch counterpart, Wopke Hoekstra, visited areas around Kyiv devastated by the war on a surprise visit to Ukraine. Both visits were unannounced, with Baerbock visiting the town of Bucha, which has become synonymous with allegations of Russian war crimes after dozens of bodies in civilian clothing were found in the streets. Baerbock is the highest-ranking German government official to visit Ukraine since the beginning of the war. As she walked around the town with Ukraine’s general prosecutor, Iryna Venediktova, Baerbock said those responsible for the killings in Bucha should face justice. Baerbock said: That is what we owe to the victims. And these victims, you can feel that here very intensely, these victims could have been us. Hoekstra tweeted that he had visited Irpin, another town near Bucha where Russian troops are alleged to have carried out atrocities. Hoekstra is also scheduled to meet with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, and with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a spokesperson from the Dutch foreign ministry said. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the EU’s planned sixth package of sanctions against Russia, including an oil embargo, was needed as the bloc’s proposal still faced talks. Addressing Slovakia’s parliament, Zelenskiy said: Now the sixth package of sanctions will be adopted, and it is certainly a package that we need, and also energy sanctions are needed. Meanwhile, the EU’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said he hoped a deal would be reached soon on an EU oil embargo on Russia, Reuters reports. Foreign ministers are due to meet on Monday. Borrell said last week that he could also call an emergency meeting of the ministers to sign off on sanctions if they were ready, or to move negotiations forward. It comes after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, hailed the “progress” made during talks with Hungary’s prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has so far resisted Brussels’ plans for a Russian oil embargo. The number of civilians killed in Ukraine since the beginning of the war is “thousands higher” than official figures, the head of the UN’s human rights monitoring mission in the country said. The official UN civilian death toll in Ukraine stands at 3,381, as well as 3,680 injured. When asked about the number of deaths and injuries, Matilda Bogner told reporters: We have been working on estimates, but all I can say for now is that it is thousands higher than the numbers we have currently given to you. The UN team, which includes 55 monitors in Ukraine, said most of the deaths have been caused by explosive weapons with a wide impact area, such as missile and air strikes. Bogner added: The big black hole is really Mariupol where it has been difficult for us to fully access and to get fully corroborated information. She said her team was also investigating “credible allegations” of torture, ill-treatment and executions by Ukrainian forces against the Russian invading forces and affiliated armed groups. Bogner said: In terms of the extent of violations by Ukrainian forces, while the scale is significantly higher on the side of allegations against Russian forces, we are also documenting violations by Ukrainian forces. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and to prevent a global food crisis. At least 100 civilians remain in Azovstal steelworks under heavy Russian fire in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol, an aide to the city’s mayor has said. Ukrainian officials have announced they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building in the north-east of the country that was destroyed weeks ago. The bodies were found in a five-story building that collapsed in March in Izyum. Russia’s underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its “best case scenario” planning have led to “demonstrable operational failings, preventing President Putin from announcing significant military success in Ukraine” at the 9 May Victory Day parade, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said. The president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, hailed “progress” made during talks with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán on Monday night, who has so far resisted Brussels’ plans for a Russian oil embargo. In the US, the White House has dismissed a Victory Day speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin as “revisionist history” and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was “patently absurd”. The Nordic region’s defence capabilities would be strengthened if Sweden and Finland joined Nato, Sweden’s defence minister told Swedish radio on Tuesday. Greece has reopened its embassy in Kyiv, joining the list of countries to begin operating diplomatic missions in Ukraine. Léonie Chao-Fong will be along shortly to take over the blog for the next few hours. Russia’s defence ministry have also published their operations update. They claim that: Units of the People’s Militia of the Luhansk People’s Republic, with the support of the armed forces of the Russian Federation, having completed the cleansing from the nationalists of the village of Popasnaya, broke through the enemy’s defence in depth and reached the administrative border of the Luhansk People’s Republic. As a result of the offensive, up to 120 nationalists, 13 armoured vehicles and 12 vehicles for various purposes were destroyed. Operational-tactical and army aviation hit 16 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine overnight. Rocket troops and artillery units hit 33 command posts, 407 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment, as well as five ammunition and fuel depots in the areas of Nikolaev and Mirny of the Nikolaev region. As a result of the strikes, up to 380 nationalists were destroyed, 53 units of military equipment were disabled. None of the claims have been independently verified. The general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine made the following claims in their operations update today: Over the past day, in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the Ukrainian defenders successfully repulsed 15 enemy attacks, destroying 1 anti-aircraft missile system, 9 tanks, 3 artillery systems, 25 armored combat vehicles, 3 units of special engineering equipment, and 3 enemy vehicles. There is no independent verification of the claims. Ukraine’s army also raised the spectre of chemical sabotage, posting as part of their daily report: Russian invaders may conduct acts of sabotage at the Ukrainian chemical industry facilities to further accuse the units of the armed forces of Ukraine of them. Again, they did not present any evidence of intelligence that directly backed the claim. Greece has reopened its embassy in Kyiv, joining the list of countries to begin operating diplomatic missions in Ukraine. Staff had withdrawn from Kyiv shortly after Russia’s invasion on 24 February with diplomats instead bolstering Greece’s consulate in eastern Ukraine, home to some 150,0000 ethnic Greeks. The embassy will be headed by Manolis Androulakism who as Greek consul general in Mariupol was the last EU envoy to leave the besieged coastal city in March. Recounting his experience upon his return to Athens, the diplomat said the bombardment of Mariupol would undoubtedly rank alongside Stalingrad and Aleppo. “Mariupol will be included in a list of cities in the world that were completely destroyed by war, such as Guernica, Stalingrad, Grozny, Aleppo,” he told reporters at Athens airport shortly after his arrival in the capital on 20 March. Athens had urged members of Ukraine’s Greek community to leave the country with Androulakis organising the evacuation of expatriates from Mariupol. The minority has had a presence around the Black Sea area, overseeing a flourishing business community, for centuries. “We tried to save as many expatriates as we could,” the diplomat said in March. “Heroes are the people who stayed on and will try to make their lives from scratch.” Here are some of the latest images from Ukraine to land across our newswires today. Ukrainian officials have announced they found the bodies of 44 civilians in the rubble of a building in the north-east of the country that was destroyed weeks ago. The bodies were found in a five-story building that collapsed in March in Izyum, about 120km (75 miles) from the city of Kharkiv, which has been under sustained Russian attack since the beginning of the war in late February. “This is another horrible war crime of the Russian occupiers against the civilian population!” said Oleh Synehubov, the head of the regional administration, in a social media message announcing the deaths, Associated Press reports that Izyum lies on a key route to the eastern industrial region of the Donbas, now the focus of Russia’s war in Ukraine. Synehubov did not say specifically where the building was. The claims have not been independently verified. More than 2 million Ukrainians have found refuge in Poland since the beginning of the war in February; the vast majority are women with children. While the two countries share history, culture and a border, women’s access to reproductive healthcare is radically different. Oxana Lytvynenko, a Ukrainian reproductive rights activist who has lived in Poland for 16 years and has been helping refugees in reception points since the war began, says that some women have no idea that their access to reproductive healthcare services will vanish upon crossing the border. “It’s difficult because you don’t want to re-traumatise these women just after they are so happy to be safe again. It doesn’t feel like the right moment to tell them the truth.” Lytvynenko says she has met women at the border who have asked her to help them access medication to terminate a pregnancy, but says that the ability to access reproductive healthcare services is down to chance.

However, this does not reduce the density of attacks by the occupiers,” Reuters reports mayoral aide Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian MP Valentyn Nalyvaichenko, a former head of the security services in the country, has been interviewed on Sky News in the UK from Kyiv. He said that yesterday “we saw again the Victory Day madness in Moscow”. He told viewers: The same day in Ukraine, in the city of Odesa, the city of Mykolaiv, Russians shelled our cities, our civilians. In Putin’s speech we did not hear any news, any good news for anybody, for us, for the whole world. It’s still the same Soviet kind propaganda. Conducting a war on our soil because of this “Russia’s motherland”. It sounds really like madness, especially on Victory Day. On the accusations in some quarters of Russia that Ukrainians had been deliberately using civilians as human shields he said: How can we use civilians as a shield when the Russian Black Sea fleet, the Russian Caspian Sea fleet are shelling missiles, Kalibr and others, against civilians? There is no protection. On the prospects for peace, he said The war will continue until Vladimir Putin wants to stop it. We understand any night in any city we can expect shelling at any minute, any hour. That is Putin’s responsibility and his decision. The Nordic region’s defence capabilities would be strengthened if Sweden and Finland joined Nato, Sweden’s defence minister told Swedish radio on Tuesday. Reuters reports defence minister Peter Hultqvist said: “There will be the effect that we use each others’ strengths and advantages and fully complement each other and also carry out operational planning.” “If so, the effect will be that we become stronger together. This is something that can happen if we choose to join Nato,” he told the nations public broadcaster. Sweden already has defence agreements with its Nordic neighbours. Russia has repeatedly warned of consequences if Finland and Sweden were to join Nato and site nuclear missiles closer to Russia’s borders. We have been sent some images over the newswires of the aftermath of what Ukraine say was a missile attack on the city of Odesa in southern Ukraine. The images have been supplied by the state emergency service of Ukraine and have not been independently verified. Weronika Strzyżyńska reports for us from Warsaw on Ukraine’s Roma refugees: “I just wish landlords would meet with us before they reject us,” says 42-year-old Nadia, who fled from her village near Donetsk when Russian bombs fell on her neighbour’s house in March. She came to Poland with her son’s wife, 22-year-old Raiia, her adult daughter, and with seven children between them. While the women have found work in a meat processing factory making hotdog sausages, like other Romany refugees they have hit a wall in finding a home. “They face discrimination,” says Mariam Masudi a coordinator at the hostel, working for Salam Lab, an NGO. “Roma are not admitted to other reception points. No one wants to rent to them. I don’t know anyone who has managed to settle in Poland. Those who have been able to move out of the hostel have moved abroad.” The official number puts Ukraine’s Roma population at 400,0, though experts see that as a low estimate. No one knows how many Ukrainian Roma have arrived in Poland, says Poland’s civil rights deputy ombudsman, Hanna Machińska. “These are large intergenerational families, some of 30 people. Most don’t have a precise plan when they arrive in Poland,” she says. “This situation requires institutional help. Individuals are not able to organise support for such large groups of people.” Read more of Weronika Strzyżyńska’s report: ‘Meet us before you reject us’: Ukraine’s Roma refugees face closed doors in Poland The president of the European commission, Ursula von der Leyen, earlier hailed the “progress” made during talks with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán, who has so far resisted Brussels’ plans for a Russian oil embargo. Landlocked Hungary relies on Russian oil from a single pipeline and Orban has warned he cannot approve the European Commission’s proposed sixth package of EU sanctions against Moscow. “This evening’s discussion with PM Viktor Orbán was helpful to clarify issues related to sanctions and energy security,” Von der Leyen tweeted. The two leaders discussed the issue during a meeting in Budapest. “We made progress, but further work is needed,” she said, adding she would organise a videoconference call “with regional players to strengthen regional cooperation on oil infrastructure”. Hungarian foreign minister Péter Szijjártó also said the two sides “made progress” but that they still had plenty to discuss. “We cannot make the Hungarian people pay the costs of this war,” he said in a video posted on Facebook, according to Reuters. Before the leaders’ talks, Orbán’s international spokesman Zoltán Kovács, citing Szijjártó, compared the sanctions package to an “atomic bomb” for Hungary’s economy. “Hungary will not vote for the EU Commission’s initiative on sanctions against Russia because it poses a problem for Hungary and does not contain a proposal for a solution,” he tweeted. “The proposal is like an atomic bomb for the Hungary economy and would destroy our stable energy supply.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and to prevent a global food crisis. Ukraine’s major Black Sea port of Odesa for exporting agricultural products was struck by missiles on Monday. For the first time in decades there is no usual movement of the merchant fleet, no usual port functioning in Odesa. Probably this has never happened in Odesa since World War II. Ordinary life related to the sea is blocked by Russia. Exactly Russia. And this affects not only Ukraine. Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages. And over time, the situation can become downright terrible. Politicians are already discussing the possible consequences of the price crisis and famine in Africa and Asia. This is a direct consequence of Russian aggression, which can be overcome only together – by all Europeans, by the whole free world. It can be overcome by putting pressure on Russia, by effectively forcing Russia to stop this disgraceful war.” Charles Michel, president of the European Council, visited Odesa and said he saw silos full of grain, wheat and corn that was ready for export but blocked. “This badly needed food is stranded because of the Russian war and blockade of Black Sea ports. Causing dramatic consequences for vulnerable countries. We need a global response,” he said. Russia’s underestimation of Ukrainian resistance and its ‘best case scenario’ planning have led to “demonstrable operational failings, preventing President Putin from announcing significant military success in Ukraine” at the 9 May Victory Day parade, the UK’s ministry of defence has said. According to the latest British intelligence report, Russia’s invasion plan is highly likely to have been based on the mistaken assumption that it would encounter limited resistance and would be able to encircle and bypass population centres rapidly. This assumption led Russian forces to attempt to carry out the opening phase of the operation with a light, precise approach intended to achieve a rapid victory with minimal cost. This miscalculation led to unsustainable losses and a subsequent reduction in Russia’s operational focus.” The White House has dismissed a Victory Day speech by Russian president Vladimir Putin as “revisionist history” and said his suggestion that western aggression led to the Ukraine war was “patently absurd”. Speaking to reporters during a press briefing on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Putin’s speech was “revisionist history that took the form of disinformation”. What we saw President Putin do is give a version of revisionist history that took the form of disinformation that we have seen too commonly as the Russian playbook. Psaki said 9 May is supposed to be “about celebrating peace and unity in Europe and the defeat of Nazis in World War Two” but instead “Putin is perverting history” to justify his unprovoked and unjustified war. Now, what is fortunate is that we are all aware – reporters around the world are aware, Europeans are aware, Americans are aware – of the disinformation factory that President Putin and the Kremlin seem to be. The suggestion that this war that was prompted by – directed by President Putin was prompted by western aggression or western plans is patently false and absurd.” US Congressional Democrats have agreed to provide a further $39.8bn in additional aid for Ukraine, two sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters on Monday. The House of Representatives could pass the plan, which exceeds president Joe Biden’s request last month for $33bn, as soon as Tuesday, and Senate leaders said they were also prepared to move quickly, the news agency reports. Biden on 28 April asked Congress for $33bn to support Ukraine, including more than $20bn in military assistance. The new proposal includes an additional $3.4bn for military aid and $3.4bn in humanitarian aid, the sources said. A statement released by the White House read: The need is also urgent: I have nearly exhausted the resources given to me by a bipartisan majority in Congress to support Ukraine’s fighters. This aid has been critical to Ukraine’s success on the battlefield. We cannot allow our shipments of assistance to stop while we await further Congressional action. We are approximately ten days from hitting this critical deadline.” Democrats and Republicans both reportedly said they supported more aid for Ukraine and would approve emergency funding quickly, but it was delayed by disputes between the parties over whether additional funding for Covid-19 relief or stiffer immigration controls should be included. Earlier on Monday, Biden signed the Ukraine Democracy Defence Lend-Lease Act of 2022 to streamline the supply of US weapons and other material to Ukraine or eastern European countries. The lend-lease act, streamlining the flow of military equipment, “is based on a WWII-era program to help Europe resist Hitler”, the White House said. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments until my colleague Martin Belam in London takes the reins a little later. It is just after 8am in Ukraine. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has urged the international community to take immediate steps to end a Russian blockade of his country’s ports in order to allow wheat shipments and to prevent a global food crisis. Ukraine’s major Black Sea port of Odesa for exporting agricultural products was struck by missiles on Monday. “Without our agricultural exports, dozens of countries in different parts of the world are already on the brink of food shortages,” he said. Russian forces, backed by tanks and artillery, were conducting “storming operations” on the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol, where the southern city’s last defenders remained holed up, Ukraine’s defence ministry said. Petro Andriushchenko, an adviser to the mayor of Mariupol, said Russian forces began “storming” the Azovstal plant after a UN convoy left the Donetsk region. The United States has seen “anecdotal reports” that some Russian troops in Ukraine are not obeying orders, according to a senior US defence official. The US believed Russian troops and “mid-grade officers at various levels, even up to the battalion level” were refusing to move forward in the Donbas offensive. The Pentagon said it had seen indications that Ukrainians caught up in Russia’s invasion were being forcibly removed to Russia. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said he “can’t speak to how many camps or what they look like”. Joe Biden has signed the Ukraine Democracy Defence Lend-Lease Act of 2022 to streamline the supply of US weapons and other material to Ukraine or eastern European countries. US congressional Democrats also agreed to provide another $39.8bn in aid for Ukraine, two sources familiar with the proposal told Reuters on Monday. The European Council president, Charles Michel, made a surprise visit to the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on Monday. Michel was forced to break off a meeting with Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, and take shelter when missiles struck the southern Ukrainian city, according to an EU official. Michel lamented that “silos full” of food for export were blocked in the Black Sea port. In Odesa, Russian missiles struck tourist sites and destroyed five buildings while injuring two people, its city council said. Ukrainian media reported a shopping centre was on fire. The European Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, hailed the “progress” made during talks with Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán during discussions related to the proposed sixth package of EU sanctions, which would include a ban on Russian oil imports to the EU. “We made progress, but further work is needed,” she said. Ukraine has submitted the second part of a formal questionnaire to obtain candidacy for EU membership. “Today we have taken another step – a very important and not just a formal step – on our path to the European Union,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced in his national address late on Monday evening. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, said Ukraine’s EU bid would “take several years, indeed, probably several decades”. Speaking to the European parliament in Strasbourg, Macron suggested creating a “parallel European community” for countries aspiring to join the bloc or, in an apparent reference to Britain, countries that had left the union. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described Macron’s suggestion as “very interesting”. Russia’s ambassador to Poland was pelted with red paint by people protesting against the war in Ukraine as he went to lay flowers at the Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw. Video footage released by Russian news agencies showed Sergey Andreev with paint on his clothes and face, surrounded by a crowd, some holding Ukrainian flags while chanting “fascists” and “murderers”. The UN human rights council is due to hold a special session on Thursday to address alleged Russian human rights violations during its war in Ukraine. More than 50 countries, including Britain, Germany, Turkey and the US, backed a request by Ukraine and demanded an extraordinary meeting of the UN’s top rights body. The UN Security Council is also expected to hold a new public meeting on Thursday on Russia’s war in Ukraine, in light of the continuing deterioration of the humanitarian situation. France and Mexico have requested briefings from the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs (Ocha) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (Unicef)," a diplomat told Agence France-Presse."""
"Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson says – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/24/russia-ukraine-war-updates-moscow-to-deepen-ties-with-china-lavrov-says-west-pledges-to-send-more-advanced-weapons-to-ukraine-live,2022-05-24T23:54:43Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. Battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate, he added. “The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now.” Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building. The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.” The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building. Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition”. The UK’s Ministry of Defence said Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation. Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers found in formerly occupied towns in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war or for Ukrainian bodies. In Kharkiv, 60 bodies were retrieved and stacked in a refrigerated rail carriage, Reuters reports. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park which was hit by about 50 shells in three months of war. “Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crimes. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko said. A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that only 10% of respondents found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace. Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. Turkey’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting. A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned from the World Economic Forum in Davos. Soros added that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression. Here are some of the latest images to come out of Ukraine today. Russia’s parliament has passed a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut down foreign media bureaus in Moscow if a western country has been “unfriendly” to Russian media. The bill, passed in the first reading by the lower house of parliament on Tuesday, needs to undergo two more readings, be reviewed by the upper house of parliament, and signed by President Vladimir Putin to become law according to a Reuters report. The journalists of a media organisation deemed to be an offender under the bill would have their foreign ministry accreditation withdrawn - meaning they could not work in Russia. “In the current geopolitical situation, the mass media has become an instrument of influence on the informational state of society,” the lawmakers said in an official explanatory note on the bill, as seen by Reuters. In accordance with the bill, a journalist and a foreign correspondent may lose their accreditation if the fact of unfriendly action is established through the imposition of restrictions on the distribution of Russian mass media operating in a foreign country.” Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation, the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned. In a ferocious attack on Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Soros warned that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression. Soros, who has become a hate figure for the hard right in the US, also heavily criticised the former German chancellor Angela Merkel for cosying up to Moscow and Beijing. With the mood in Davos already downbeat due to the war in Ukraine, Soros ramped up the gloomy rhetoric to new heights. “The invasion may have been the beginning of the third world war and our civilisation may not survive it,” he said. “The invasion of Ukraine didn’t come out of the blue. The world has been increasingly engaged in a struggle between two systems of governance that are diametrically opposed to each other: open society and closed society.” Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers strewn among the rubble of formerly occupied towns and using everything from DNA to tattoos to verify their identities in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war, Reuters is reporting. Volunteers have helped the military gather 60 bodies in the northeastern region of Kharkiv where Russian forces have retreated in recent weeks, stacking them up in a refrigerated rail carriage. Bodies are sometimes used as part of prisoner exchanges and other times in exchanges for Ukrainian bodies, according to Anton Ivannikov, captain of the Ukrainian armed forces military-civil cooperation branch, which is coordinating the effort. We are gathering all the documents, all the credit cards. Anything which would help us identify the body” including tattoos and DNA, Ivannikov said. In the future this will tell us which soldier, which brigade was in this region, for further exchange.” The bodies will travel on the train to Kyiv where the team negotiating exchanges is based, he added. Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. He said battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate and that Russian forces had not given up attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets river. Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building.

The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Lugansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance.“The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.

Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov battalion, was able to briefly call his wife, Kateryna, who said she had also been told that the prisoners had not been subjected to violence. It was not immediately clear if Prokopenko had been able to speak freely during the conversation. “He said he was ‘OK’ and asked how I was,” Kateryna Prokopenko told the Guardian on Tuesday. “I’ve heard from other sources that the conditions are more or less satisfactory.” At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. Kateryna Prokopenko, the wife of the Ukrainian commander of the Azov regiment that led the defence of Mariupol, Denys Prokopenko.Photograph: Natacha Pisarenko/AP The Azov battalion has played a central role in Russia’s justification for its invasion, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. Officials in Kyiv have suggested they could be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials have called for them to face trial or even execution on “terrorism” charges. Previously, the only news of the fighters’ conditions had come via a news channel given access to the prison by the Russian Ministry of Defence. The International Committee of the Red Cross, which is involved in monitoring the conditions for prisoners of war and has a long-held policy of not publicly commenting, has not issued a statement. “They are being fed, given water. The conditions meet the requirements and they have not been subjected to violence during this short period,” said Kateryna Prokopenko. “What will happen next, of course, we don’t know but at the moment there are third parties – the UN and the Red Cross – who are controlling the situation.” Most of the injured Azov fighters are being held in a prison in Olenivka, a village in Russian-occupied Donetsk, but a smaller group of severely injured fighters are in a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, also in Russian-occupied Donetsk. Prokopenko said that to her knowledge none of the fighters have been taken to Russia.

And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers.” In his daily address, he said that the situation in Donbas remained dire. “The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult,” he said. “In fact, all the strength the Russian army still has was thrown there to attack. Lyman, Popasna, Severodonetsk, Slovyansk - the occupiers want to destroy everything there.” He then reiterated a need for heavy weapons: Therefore, the supply of heavy weapons to Ukraine - MLRS, tanks, anti-ship and other weapons - is the best investment in maintaining stability in the world and preventing many severe crises that Russia is still planning or has already provoked. We continue to work to ensure that Ukraine receives reliable security guarantees after this war. In particular, an international advisory group headed by Yermak and former NATO Secretary General Rasmussen has been set up. The group will include leading experts in the fields of security and defense, diplomacy. Their task is to develop a format of guarantees that will really work. And not for several months or years, but during the lifetime of many generations of our Ukrainians. The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Lugansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance. “The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse. It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “Shelling is increasing more and more.” He added that the Russians are focused on the key city of Severodonetsk. “The city is being bombed by aviation, shelled by multiple launch rocket systems, artillery, mortars, tanks,” he said. “They are simply eliminating Severodonetsk from the earth.” The US Treasury Department said it will not renew the license allowing Russia to pay debts via American banks. The AP reports: Since the first rounds of sanctions, the Treasury Department has given banks a license to process any dollar-denominated bond payments from Russia. That window expires at midnight May 25. There had already been signs that the Biden administration was unwilling to extend the deadline. At a press conference heading into the Group of Seven finance minister meetings in Koenigswinter, Germany, last week, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the window existed “to allow a period of time for an orderly transition to take place, and for investors to be able to sell securities.” “The expectation was that it was time-limited,” Yellen said. Without the license to use U.S. banks to pay its debts, Russia would have no ability to repay its international bond investors. The Kremlin has been using JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup as its conduits to pay its obligations. “The majority who wanted out have gotten out. The only issue is finding buyers,” he said. The Kremlin appears to have foreseen the likelihood that the U.S. would not allow Russia to keep paying on its bonds. The Russian Finance Ministry prepaid two bonds on Friday that were due this month to get ahead of the May 25 deadline. The next payments Russia will need to make on its debts are due on June 23. Like other Russian debt, those bonds have a 30-day grace period — which would cause default by Russia to be declared by late July, barring the unlikely scenario that the Russia-Ukraine war would come to an end before then. Investors have been almost certain of Russia going into default for months now. Insurance contracts that cover Russian debt have priced a 80% likelihood of default for weeks and rating agencies like Standard &amp; Poor’s and Moody’s have placed the country’s debt deep into junk territory. Russia has not defaulted on its international debts since the 1917 Revolution, when the Russian Empire collapsed and the Soviet Union was created. Russia defaulted on its domestic debts in the late 1990s during the Asian Financial Crisis, but was able to recover from that default with the help of international aid. A Russian default this time will likely have little-to-minimal impact on the global economy, Auslander said, since Russia has been cut off from global financial markets for months now and investors have been expecting a default. Biden officials have made similar statements. Here’s an exclusive from the Guardian’s Kate Connolly: Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, has backed a recovery programme for Ukraine in the style of the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war. Connolloy writes: With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” the former presidential candidate said in an interview with the Guardian. Buttigieg admitted that while “the destruction of Ukrainian homes and infrastructure is still under way”, to talk about reconstruction might feel premature “and yet in my encounters with Ukrainian leaders, and particularly my counterpart [Oleksandr Kubrakov], who I speak to regularly, they are already thinking about reconstruction even as they’re thinking about defending their homeland and it’s inspiring to see and it deserves strong and unified support from us.” He said a “major topic of conversation” among transport ministers at the world meeting in Leipzig this week for the International Transport Forum was how they could help to get grain and other produce out of Ukraine, which is stuck because of blocked and destroyed ports and railway lines and is threatening to create a global food shortage. “This is not only something that concerns us, as friends to Ukraine, but also concerns us because the world needs that production, especially on the agricultural side,” he said. “Without access to the Black Sea, it’s always going to be a major disadvantage. We’re committed to helping there in any way we can. “But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west. “But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.” Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war.

Ukraine’s military said Russian troops had killed at least 14 civilians and injured 15 more on Tuesday during mass attacks in the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions, the focus of Moscow’s latest offensive, Reuters reports. In a Facebook post it said Russian troops had used aircraft, multiple rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, mortars and missiles in their assault on the two regions, large parts of which are controlled by Russian-speaking separatists. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park, Agence France-Presse reports. Prosecutors took up the case to ensure that the park, which was hit by around 50 shells in three months of war, could be open without the public being at risk and, above all, determine whether the attacks constitute a war crime. Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crime. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” said Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko. The shells also hit a small theatre and a closed restaurant in the park. The shrapnel even reached and damaged bronze sculptures of children scattered around the park. For John Culp, a retired US soldier and American de-miner from the US-based non-profit Bombs Tech Without Borders, there was no doubt the Russians were targeting the park deliberately: “We are in Gorky Park.. With its paths, its stages etc.. We are investigating the fact that many rockets and shells were fired in and near the park. There is no military target here. It was done knowingly to cause terror and fear among the civilian population,” said Culp, who is helping advise his Ukrainian counterparts. The self-proclaimed leader of the Moscow-backed separatist region of Donetsk has said Russian and separatist forces were fighting to take full control of the town of Lyman and have already captured half of it, Agence France-Presse reports. The active phase of the liberation of Krasny Liman is underway,” separatist leader Denis Pushilin said on the pro-Kremlin Solovyov Live YouTube programme. Located in the north of the eastern Donetsk region, Krasny Liman is the old name of the Ukrainian town of Lyman. Lyman lies on the road to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, the capital of the Ukrainian-controlled part of the region of Donetsk. Pushilin said the Russian army and separatist troops have entered the town and controlled around half of it. Krasny Liman will also soon be a liberated settlement. Svyatogorsk will come afterwards and then Slavyansk.” He said Russian and separatist forces have now taken control of 28 settlements in the north of the region of Donetsk. Svyatogorsk (Svyatogirsk in Ukrainian) and Slavyansk (Sloviansk in Ukrainian) are also located in the region of Donetsk. There was no immediate comment from Russia and Ukraine. Pushilin’s claims could not be independently verified. Russia is focused on securing and expanding its gains in the eastern Donbas region, near the border and home to pro-Russian separatists, as well as the southern coast. Separately, the Ukrainian army announced that Russians were now in control of town of Svitlodarsk, also in the Donetsk region. Regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that Ukrainian troops “have regrouped to take a more favourable position”. Reuters adds that Russian forces were in the process of an all-out assault to encircle Ukrainian troops in twin cities straddling a river in eastern Ukraine on Tuesday, a battle which could determine the success or failure of Moscow’s main campaign in the east. Civilians had been evacuating from the area around Lyman earlier in May. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. He said battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate and that Russian forces had not given up attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets river.

Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”. The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official.

Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk region towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko. Svitlodarsk is 80km southwest of the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under intense bombardment in recent days. Earlier today, it was reported that Russian forces had entered Svitlodarsk and hung up a Russian flag over the city administration building. Canada has purchased 20,000 artillery rounds of Nato standard ammunition for Ukraine to support it in its defence against Russia’s invasion, defence minister, Anita Anand, said. The ammunition was purchased from the US for about C$98m (£61m) and would soon be delivered to Ukraine as a donation. They can be fired from artillery cannons, including the M777 Howitzers that Canada has already sent. Anand said the shipment of military aid will be “critical in Ukraine’s current struggle to defend its eastern territory,” and that “work is already underway to deliver this aid to Ukraine as soon as possible”. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. The ministry said the 154 people “made a direct contribution to the development of London’s anti-Russian sanctions” aimed at creating conditions for the “political isolation of Russia and the destruction of its economy”. It also accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK” and “pandered to the Russophobic political course of the British Conservative government”. Those blacklisted include William Hague, a former foreign minister and leader of the Conservative Party in opposition. Notably, the list does not include Evgeny Lebedev, the Russian-born press baron who was controversially granted a peerage by Boris Johnson’s government in 2020. Questions have been raised about Johnson’s close ties to Lebedev, who owns the London Evening Standard and Independent newspapers, as his father Alexander has admitted he was a KGB agent. Here’s a bit more detail from Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk, who said battles being fought in eastern Ukraine could determine the country’s fate. During a televised briefing, Motuzyanyk said: Now we are observing the most active phase of the full-scale aggression which Russia unfolded against our country. The situation on the (eastern) front is extremely difficult, because the fate of this country is perhaps being decided (there) right now. Russia’s military campaign in Ukraine has entered its most active phase, according to Ukraine’s defence ministry spokesperson, Oleksandr Motuzyanyk. Russian forces are trying to encircle Ukrainian troops in two cities straddling the Siverskyi Donets river in eastern Ukraine – Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Motuzyanyk said Russian forces had not given up attempts to cross the river, Reuters reports. It is 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The governor of Luhansk has delivered a grim warning that it is too late for thousands of civilians to be evacuated from the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk. Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces who have been attempting to complete their encirclement of the pocket around the city, Sievierodonetsk and the towns and villages to its west have been under intense bombardment in recent days. Fifteen thousand residents were still believed to be in the city hiding in shelters. The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official.

hchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition”. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation. A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that only 10% of respondents found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace. Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. Turkey’s foreign ministry confirmed the meeting. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said Budapest was not in a position to agree to the EU’s proposed new sanctions, including an oil embargo on Russia. In a letter to the European Council’s president, Charles Michel, Orbán said it was “unlikely” a solution could be found by next week’s summit of EU leaders and that leaders should not discuss the issue at the meeting. A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, said Budapest was not in a position to agree to the EU’s proposed new sanctions, including an oil embargo on Russia. In a letter to the European Council’s president, Charles Michel, Orbán said it was “unlikely” a solution could be found by next week’s summit of EU leaders and that leaders should not discuss the issue at the meeting. The letter reads: Looking at the gravity of the issues still open, it is very unlikely that a comprehensive solution could be found before the special meeting of the European Council on 30-31 May. Orbán said he was “convinced” that discussing the sanctions package “in the absence of a consensus would be counterproductive”, adding that it would only highlight the internal divisions without offering a realistic chance of resolving them. Hungary relies on Russian oil from a single pipeline and its leader has argued that an embargo would devastate the country’s economy. The EU has offered Budapest, as well as Slovakia and the Czech Republic, lengthy exemptions from imposing the embargo. Despite this, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said it was a only “matter of weeks” for the EU to agree on an embargo on Russian oil. Speaking to CNN, she said: We are working hard on it right now, it’s a matter of weeks but we really must find a solution for the investment needs. Therefore, this is important, we have to tailor it in a way that we do not have the situation that Putin can take the oil. That he doesn’t sell it to us and [then] sells it at a higher price on the world market. A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances. Researchers at the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology spoke to 2,000 adult citizens of Ukraine between 13 and 18 May. They found that 82% of respondents said they did not support territorial concessions. Only 10% believed that some territories could be abandoned in order to achieve peace and preserve independence, researchers said. According to the poll, 77% of Ukrainians living in Russian-occupied territory opposed any land concessions. In the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is currently taking place, only 19% of respondents said they were ready to make territorial concessions; 68% said they were against. In the south of Ukraine, 83% of respondents said they were against any territorial concessions and 9% found it acceptable for Ukraine to concede territory to achieve peace. From Politico’s Christopher Miller: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, spoke with his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, and discussed potential ways to get Ukraine’s grain out of the country, a spokesperson for the US state department said. The spokesperson said in a statement: The Secretary noted the global food security crisis resulting from President Putin’s brutal war requires a global response, and they discussed potential means to export Ukraine’s grain to international markets. Blinken also gave Kuleba details about the $40.1 bn in supplemental appropriations that was signed into law by President Joe Biden this weekend, the statement said. The US secretary “underscored the United States’ strong support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of Moscow’s aggression”, the spokesperson added. Kuleba also tweeted about the call and said the pair “discussed ways to unblock Ukraine’s exports and ensure global food security”. The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building. Andryushchenko wrote on Telegram: During the dismantling of the blockages of a high-rise building near the suburban gas station about 200 bodies were found dead in the basement under the blockages with a high degree of decomposition. Due to the refusal of locals to collect and pack the bodies of the dead, the Russian ministry of emergencies left the work site. Anton Gerashchenk, an adviser to Ukraine’s internal affairs ministry, said Russian forces had tried to force locals to take the bodies out. When they refused, the grave site was simply abandoned, he said. It has not been possible to independently verify this information. Russia’s ministry of defence has just issued a denial that its sailors are being forced to disassemble household appliances to use them for spare parts aboard Russian ships in the Caspian sea. It says: Ukrainian propagandists find it difficult to explain what specific elements from household appliances can be used in the most complex electronics of a Navy ship. Also, not a single specific case is given where a washing machine would have to be disassembled to repair a combat unit. The ministry compares what it says is the fake story to rumours that have previously circulated about using domestic machines for spare parts for tanks. Perhaps more significant however than the attempt to debunk the tale, is the end of the statement. The ministry of defence asserts: As for microelectronics manufacturers, there are enough resources in the Russian Federation. In addition, Russia intends to join efforts in the production of microelectronics with Belarus in order to fully provide for the military. Russia’s parliament is to consider eliminating the upper age limit for signing up to join the army, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. A draft bill on the agenda of the lower house State Duma for today would completely lift that upper age limit. Two members of the ruling United Russia party who introduced the law said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. A note accompanying the draft bill reads: For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Such specialists usually acquire the necessary skills when they reach their early- to mid-40s, the note adds. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. The son of a Russian billionaire sanctioned for supporting the dictator who runs Belarus has been linked to a £160m portfolio of London properties. Said Gutseriev, a 34-year-old businessman with British and Russian nationality, appears to have spent years amassing a collection of at least seven properties in central London, according to the findings of a joint investigation by the Guardian and the Belarusian Investigative Center, part of the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project. The portfolio ranges from large office buildings in the City to a pair of £17m townhouses in south Kensington knocked together to make one residence. Said’s father, Mikhail Gutseriev, was blacklisted last year, by the EU in June and the UK in August, months after the violent repression of protests which threatened to bring to an end 26 years of autocratic rule by Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko. The UK government described Gutseriev as “a longstanding associate” of the president, and had used his business interests to support Lukashenko’s government. All of the properties examined in the investigation were bought before Mikhail was sanctioned. Six were acquired between 2004 and 2012, when Said was either at school or university, or was just starting his career at the FTSE 100 commodities trader Glencore. Said attended £14,500 a term Harrow school before studying at Oxford. Leaked documents suggest Said was given a head start thanks to his family’s wealth. One of the properties appears to ultimately belong to a trust established by his father in 2007. Said was listed as a beneficiary of the trust in official paperwork from 2008 and 2009 seen by the Guardian. The paperwork also names him as a beneficiary of a second trust, established in 2004 by his grandmother, Marem Gutserieva. Said controls a stake in Russneft, the Russian oil company that was part-owned by his father until the latter transferred his holding to his brother in August 2021. A spokesperson for Said Gutseriev said he has no financial or commercial links to his father, and always acts in accordance with applicable law, including on sanctions. The spokesperson did not dispute Said’s ownership of any of the properties. The information about assets linked to him in the UK raises questions about whether sanctions should apply to family members. The UK has no plans to send Royal Navy warships to the Black Sea to help get food exports such as grain out of the blockaded Ukrainian port of Odesa, according to a government spokesperson. Lithuania’s foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, said he had spoken to his UK counterpart, Liz Truss, about creating a “protective corridor” from the port of Odesa, The Times reports. The operation would involve a “coalition of the willing” to provide ships to clear the port. The UK government spokesperson said: Putin’s despicable blockade of Odesa is preventing food getting to people who need it. We will continue to work intensively with international partners to find ways to resume the export of grain from Ukraine. However, there are no current plans to deploy UK warships to the Black Sea. Turkey’s foreign ministry has confirmed that Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara tomorrow to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said earlier that his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital on Wednesday to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership of the military alliance. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, held separate phone calls with leaders of Finland and Sweden on Saturday and discussed his concerns. Turkey says Sweden and Finland harbour people linked to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which Turkey regards as a terrorist organisation, and followers of Fethullah Gulen, whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. France’s minister for Europe, Clément Beaune, said he is “convinced” Ukraine will eventually be part of the European Union but that it will take time. Earlier this month, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, suggested creating a new “European political community” that would create a new structure allowing closer cooperation with countries seeking EU membership. Beaune, who earlier this week said it could take between 15 and 20 years for Ukraine to join the EU, was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters today: We know with honesty that it takes time and in this time we can’t allow ourselves to simply wait. We have to nurture the European hope. The European political community project would not be an alternative, he insisted at a joint press conference with Ukraine’s prime minister, Olga Stefanishyna. The next step would be to discuss the details of the initiative with European partners, Beaune added. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, claimed Moscow has not yet seen an Italian peace plan for Ukraine but that it hopes to receive it through diplomatic channels. Last week, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, presented a four-step peace plan to end the conflict in Ukraine and said he had discussed it with the UN secretary general, António Guterres, during a visit to New York. The plan calls for local ceasefires to allow for civilian evacuation, the demilitarisation of the front lines, the possible neutrality of Ukraine, an agreement between Russia and Ukraine on the future of Crimea and Donbas, and the creation of a new European and international security pact. Di Maio said the plan has also been proposed to senior officials representing G7 nations. During his regular briefing with reporters today, Peskov said of the Italian peace plan: We haven’t seen it yet, we hope it will be delivered to us through diplomatic channels and we will familiarise ourselves with it. Earlier we reported that the former Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, was dismissive of the plan in a lengthy message on Telegram. Lorenzo Tondo reports for us on the Ukrainian farmers devastated by war: There was a gruelling artillery duel between Ukrainian and Russian troops, positioned just four kilometres apart. Right in the middle, between the two frontlines, stood Ivan Mishchenko’s farmhouse, with his dozens of cows and 100 hectares (247 acres) of wheat fields, transformed into a bloody battleground for five consecutive days in early March. “Two kilometres on the right were the Russian troops, two kilometres on the left were our troops,” said Mishchenko,66, whose farm lies in the countryside around Pochepyn, a small village north of Kyiv. They were shooting so hard, as if it was some kind of computer game. The first two days I stayed in the house, but then it was so insufferable that I had to leave. When I returned, I was in shock. My house, the warehouse, the barns ... were all destroyed. I lost everything. Mishchenko, who has livestock and grain fields, is one of hundreds of Ukrainian farmers whose businesses were devastated by a war that has unleashed economic devastation in the country and threatened famine elsewhere. And like other farmers in Ukraine, his few hectares of surviving wheat fields cannot be harvested due to the shortage of fuel in the region and after his harvester and other machinery were destroyed by shelling. Silos and ports across Ukraine are brimming with more than 20 million metric tonnes of grain and corn that has nowhere to go, with Russia blockading the country’s Black Sea coast and the exit routes for Ukraine’s grain. Ukraine used to export most of its goods through seaports but since Russia invaded the country, it has been forced to export by train or via its small Danube River ports. As a result, global wheat prices leaped by 20% in March, owing to the direct impact of the war on wheat production, with the world facing a worsening state of food insecurity and malnutrition, at a time when 42 million people were already one step away from famine. David Beasley, the executive director of the UN World Food Programme, which feeds 125 million people and buys 50% of its grain from Ukraine, appealed to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin: If you have any heart at all, please open these ports. “This is not just about Ukraine,” Beasley said last week. “This is about the poorest of the poor who are on the brink of starvation as we speak.” Read more of Lorenzo Tondo’s story: ‘My house, the barns, I lost everything’: the Ukrainian farmers devastated by war Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said the Russian offensive in the Donbas is “the largest one on European soil since WWII”. Kuleba tweeted that it was “too early” to conclude that Kyiv already has all the weapons it needs to defend itself against the Russian offensive. He urged allies to “speed up deliveries of weapons and ammunition, especially MLRS (multiple rocket launch systems), long-range artillery, APCs (armoured personnel carriers)“. Kuleba later accused Russian “thieves” of stealing Ukrainian grain, loading it onto ships and then passing through the Bosphorus to try to sell it abroad. He urged countries to “refuse such proposals” and to not buy the stolen grain adding: Don’t become accomplices to Russian crimes. Theft has never brought anyone luck. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. I’m on Twitter or you can email me. The governor of Luhansk has delivered a grim warning that it is too late for thousands of civilians to be evacuated from the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk, as it faced a sustained Russian effort to take the city and the parts of the province still held by Ukraine. Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces who have been attempting to complete their encirclement of the pocket around the city, Sievierodonetsk and the towns and villages to its west have been under intense bombardment in recent days. Fifteen thousand residents were still believed to be in the city hiding in shelters. Russian forces have been attempting to cut Ukrainian supply lines to Sievierodonestsk by attempting to control key roads to the west. “At this point I will not say: get out, evacuate. Now I will say: stay in a shelter,” Sergiy Haidai said on his Telegram channel. “Because such a density of shelling will not allow us to calmly gather people and come for them.” “The enemy has focused efforts on the offensive operation to encircle Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Now, with the support of artillery, they are conducting assault operations in the direction of Toshkivka and Ustynivka, near Lysychansk,” Haidai wrote. Ukraine’s defence ministry reported on Monday that Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukrainian defences around Popasna in an attempt to push west toward Bakhmut, a crucial junction that serves as a command centre for much of the Ukrainian war effort. “I looked up from my prayers and heard a frightening sound,” said 82-year-old Maria Mayashlapak a resident of Bakhmut which has seen repeated airstrikes. “Every day I pray to God asking to avoid injuries. God heard me. God is watching over me.” Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia’s ministry of defence claims to have destroyed a warehouse full of ammunition in Razdolovka which was stockpiling 155mm shells manufactured for American-made M-777 howitzers supplied to Ukraine. Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Sieverodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine and is not “chasing deadlines”. ““All the goals set by the president will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise,” he said. The Russia-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Kherson region will ask Moscow to set up a military base on its territory, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reports. Russia successfully seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in mid-March which is adjacent to Crimea, the peninsula which Moscow has controlled since 2014. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.” A team of Colombian soldiers will travel to Europe to train their Ukrainian counterparts on de-mining techniques, the South American country’s defence minister has said. Finland and Sweden will send delegations to Ankara tomorrow to try to resolve Turkish opposition to their applications for membership of the Nato military alliance, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto has said. Poland has continued to signal its intent to bolster its defences in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Defence secretary Mariusz Blaszczak said the country intends to buy six additional Patriot missile batteries. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the European Commission, says the war on Ukraine is putting the international order into question. She said the World Economic Forum at Davos should be talking about making the world better together, but instead they must talk about Putin’s invasion, where Russia’s playbook for the war “comes out of another century”. To rebuild Ukraine, she said “We should leave no stone unturned, including possibly using the Russian assets we have frozen.” A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers were due to face war crimes trials, she said, and Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a Harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, said Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary. The new security packages included “critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”. The turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underlined the need for a free Indo-Pacific region, Joe Biden has said, at a meeting with regional partners that Beijing has criticised as part of a US-led attempt to contain China. “Low-level” discussions were under way on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Finland and Sweden will send delegations to Ankara tomorrow to try to resolve Turkish opposition to their applications for membership of the Nato military alliance, Finland’s foreign minister Pekka Haavisto has said. “We are sending our delegations to visit Ankara, actually both Sweden and Finland. This will happen tomorrow so the dialogue is continuing,” Haavisto said during a panel discussion in Davos, Reuters reports. Ursula von der Leyen, head of the Europen Commission, says Ukraine’s war is putting the international order into question, as she addresses the World Economic Forum’s Congress Hall. She says Davos should be talking about making the world better together, but instead they must talk about Putin’s invasion, where Russia’s playbook for the war “comes out of another century”. It is not just a question of Ukraine’s survival, or European security. It is putting the entire international order into question, says von der Leyen. Ukraine must win this war. And Putin’s aggession must be a strategic failure. Von der Leyen says Ukraine needs direct budget support now, which is why the EC proposed a $10bn package of financial assistance, its biggest ever package for a third country. The same resolve will help Ukraine rise from the ashes, von der Leyen insists, which is the idea behind the reconstruction plan proposed to president Zelenskiy. The work is colossal, but “together we can and will, master the challenge”. Any country that cares about Ukraine, multinational institutions, companies. everyone, should contribute. And Von der Leyen says that Russian assets frozen overseas could be used to fund reconstruction too: We should leave no stone unturned, including possibly using the Russian assets we have frozen. Dmitry Medvedev, a long-term ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin and deputy chairman of the security council of Russia since 2020 has poured scorn on recent attempts to mediate peace between Russian and Ukraine in a lengthy message on Telegram. Among his points, Medvedev says the peace plans being proposed by European powers would be “fine if it was about preparing options that somehow take into account the realities.” He criticises the recent efforts by Italy as “prepared not by diplomats, but by local political scientists who have read a lot of provincial newspapers and operate only with Ukrainian fakes.” He dismisses the possibility that Ukraine would ever become a full member of the European Union – “they know that this is a lie” because it would be “too costly and dangerous” for Ukraine to join either the EU or Nato. Medvedev describes the concept of an autonomous Donbas “while maintaining it within the framework of Ukraine” as “obvious nonsense and cheap projecting”. He says “decisions about their fate of the Republic of Donbas were final and they will not be turned back.” He also dismissed any peace deal involving Crimea, stating that even putting it on the table was “a threat to [Russia’s] territorial integrity and a pretext for starting a full-fledged war. There is not and never will be a political force in Russia that would even agree to discuss the fate of Crimea. It would be just a national betrayal.” Sweden and Finland will attend the Nato summit in Madrid next month, Spain’s prime minister Pedro Sanchez has said during the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Reuters reports. The Nato summit will be held 28-30 June. A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Reuters reports that Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. “This is a stupid war which your Putin started,” Navalny,45, told an appeal court in Moscow via video link from a penal colony. “This war was built on lies.” “What do you want to achieve - do you want short-term control, to fight with future generations, fight for the future of Russia?” Navalny asked the court. “You will all suffer historic defeat.” Navalny said Putin’s Russia was run by thieves and criminals who had become enemies of the Russian people. “One madman has got his claws into Ukraine and I do not know what he wants to do with it - this crazy thief,” Navalny said of Putin. Russian Security Council secretary Nikolai Patrushev said on Tuesday that Russia will achieve its objectives in Ukraine and is not “chasing deadlines”. “All the goals set by the president will be fulfilled. It cannot be otherwise, because truth, including historical truth, is on our side,” Patrushev said in an interview with the Russian Argumenty i Fakty newspaper. “We are not chasing deadlines,” Reuters report he added. Deputy US defence secretary Kathleen Hicks has said the US is confident that Finland and Sweden will be able to resolve Turkish objections to their proposed membership of Nato. Asked about the issues while in Oslo, Reuters report she said the US is “confident that Finland and Sweden will be able to resolve those with the Turks directly”. Serhiy Gaidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has issued a further update via Telegram. Four civilians died in one high-rise in Sievierodonetsk. The Russians are shelling the regional centre chaotically and uninterruptedly. The tragedy occurred in the old parts of the town. When police arrived, they found the bodies of two men and a woman with no signs of life. Another woman was seriously wounded. She was given first aid and hospitalised, but died in the operating room. All four probably were living in the same apartment building. Yesterday, this street was shelled heavily – several houses were damaged. In the town overall at least six houses were damaged, as well as in Lysychansk, where a man was saved in one of the high-rises. We received information that the enemy shelled again the building of the regional boarding school for children in Hirske two days late. There are also constant reports on destroyed housing in Popasna and Rubizne. The claims have not been independently verified. Poland has continued to signal its intent to bolster its defences in the light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Reuters report that it intends to buy six additional Patriot missile batteries. “I signed a letter of request concerning six Patriot batteries with omnidirectional radars, launchers and a supply of missiles,” defence secretary Mariusz Blaszczak wrote on Twitter. Warsaw has vowed to raise its defence spending to 3% of GDP and more than double the size of its army to deter any possible attack. Poland already has two Patriot batteries. Russia’s ministry of defence has issued its operation briefing for 24 May. It claims: High-precision air-based missiles hit: three command posts, 36 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment … and six ammunition depots in the areas of Minkovka, Bakhmut, Nikolaevka, Disputed and Krasny Liman in Donetsk, including one large warehouse of 155mm shells for American M-777 howitzers in Razdolovka. In addition, the report claims: Rocket troops and artillery hit 84 command posts, 463 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as 137 artillery and mortar units in firing positions. Russia’s defence ministry says it killed over 200 Ukrainian soldiers overnight, and that in total since the latest invasion began in February 2022, “178 aircraft, 125 helicopters, 995 unmanned aerial vehicles, 320 anti-aircraft missile systems have been destroyed”. The claims have not been independently verified. The BBC is reporting that in the Kursk region of Russia, the governor Roman Starovoit has extended the “yellow” alert of a terror threat for another two weeks until 8 June. Russian authorities have repeatedly claimed that villages on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine have been fired on. The neighbouring Russian regions of Bryansk and Belgorod also raised their terror-threat levels to “yellow” in April. Ukraine’s Luhansk governor, Serhiy Gaidai, has given his morning report about Severodonetsk, the city which has been a focus of Russian operations and which lies around 110km (70 miles) from the city of Luhansk. Gaidai has posted to Telegram: Severodonetsk holds the defence – the city is completely under the control of the Ukrainian authorities. The Russians concentrated almost all their forces, namely 25 battalion tactical groups to take the city. The number of shellings increased many times. Battles are taking place in the surrounding villages. It is very difficult to evacuate people. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has reported on Telegram that there were no air alerts in the region overnight. Lviv is to the west of Ukraine, away from the main theatre of operations in the Donbas. In the UK, transport secretary Grant Shapps has been interviewed on Sky News about the grain export situation with Ukraine. He said it was important for grain from the country to be able to get out. Shapps said that he would not go into the specifics of any potential deployment of British ships into the Black Sea. He commented: There are a lot of complexities to this, including mined waters near Odesa. Clearly, the situation with Russia and Putin – their approach to this – could be very difficult. A team of Colombian soldiers will travel to Europe to train their Ukrainian counterparts on de-mining techniques, the South American country’s defence minister has said. Colombia’s nearly 60 years of internal conflict between the armed forces, leftist rebels, rightwing paramilitaries and drug cartels has made it one of the world’s most-mined countries, according to the United Nations. Landmines have killed 2,342 people in Colombia and injured close to 10,000 since 1990, according to the government. Russian soldiers and Ukrainian authorities both have said they will clear landmines from various locations in Ukraine amid the ongoing invasion launched by Russia in February. The experts from Colombia, which is a Nato partner, were invited to give the training by the US, Colombian defence minister Diego Molano said in a statement as reported by Reuters. “This training will be given by 11 military engineers who will go to a Nato member country which is a neighbour of Ukraine,” Molano said. The turmoil caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has underlined the need for a free Indo-Pacific region, Joe Biden has said, at the start of a meeting with regional partners that Beijing has criticised as part of a US-led attempt to contain China. Biden, and the leaders of a loose alliance known as the Quad – India, Japan and Australia – reaffirmed their commitment to a “free and open” Indo-Pacific during talks in Tokyo on Tuesday. The comments came one day after the US president said Washington would be ready to intervene militarily to defend Taiwan, prompting China to accuse him of “playing with fire”. “This is about democracies versus autocracies, and we have to make sure we deliver,” Biden said at the start of the meeting with Modi, Japan’s prime minister, Fumio Kishida, and Australia’s new prime minister, Anthony Albanese. The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days”, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday, but making a dent in Russia’s war chest may require capping global oil prices. “We will reach a breakthrough within days,” Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF when asked about an EU oil embargo in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He warned, however, that an embargo would not automatically weaken the Kremlin. Rising global oil prices after the US announced an embargo on Russian oil enabled it to rake in more income while selling lower volumes. Therefore, the European Commission and US were working on a proposal to no longer pay “any price” for oil, but to cap global prices, he said. “It is obviously an unusual measure, but these are unusual times,” he said. “This path only works if many countries get onboard … and that’s proving to be the sticking point.” Zelenskiy added that President Vladimir Putin is the only Russian official he is willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. In an earlier video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Ukrainian president said: The president of the Russian Federation decides it all. If we are talking about ending this war without him personally, that decision cannot be taken. I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president. And only in the case when there is one issue on the (table): stopping the war. There are no other grounds for any other kind of meeting.” Zelenskiy added that arranging any talks with Russia was becoming more difficult in light of what he said was evidence of Russian actions against civilians under occupation. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy reiterated that the heaviest fighting in Ukraine is occurring in the Donbas region. In his most recent late-night national address, he said: The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas. Bakhmut, Popasna, Severodonetsk - in this direction the occupiers have concentrated the greatest activity so far. They organised a massacre there and are trying to destroy everything living there. Literally. Nobody destroyed Donbas as much as the Russian army does now.” Russian forces are also fighting hard to not give up the occupied areas of the Kharkiv region, the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhia region and Donbas, Zelenskiy added. “They are going on the offensive in some areas. Reserves are being accumulated in some areas. Somewhere they are trying to reinforce their positions,” he said. The coming weeks of the war will be difficult. And we must be aware of that. Yet we have no alternative but to fight. Fight and win. Free our land and our people. Because the occupiers want to take away from us not just something, but everything we have. Including the right to life for Ukrainians.” Russia has increased the intensity of its operations in the Donbas as it seeks to encircle Severodonetsk, Lyschansk, and Rubizhne in order to place the whole of Luhansk oblast under Russian occupation, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. According to a recently published intelligence report, at present the northern and southern axes of Russia’s operation are separated by approximately 25km of Ukrainian-held territory. There has been strong Ukrainian resistance with forces occupying well dug-in defensive positions. Ukraine’s long-established Joint Force Operation likely retains effective command and control of this front. Russia has, however, achieved some localised successes, due in part to concentrating artillery units. Russia’s capture of the Severodonetsk pocket would see the whole of Luhansk oblast placed under Russian occupation. While currently Russia’s main effort, this operation is only one part of Russia’s campaign to seize the Donbas. If the Donbas front line moves further west, this will extend Russian lines of communication and likely see its forces face further logistic resupply difficulties.” Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, US defence secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Monday. Among the countries that announced new packages are Italy, Denmark, Greece, Norway and Poland. We’ve gained a sharper, shared sense of Ukraine’s priority requirements and the situation on the battlefield,” Austin told reporters. Many countries are donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles. Others came forward with new commitments for training.” Denmark agreed to provide a harpoon launcher and missiles to “help Ukraine defend its coast” and the Czech Republic also agreed to send “substantial support” to Kyiv including “a recent donation of attack helicopters, tanks and rocket systems”, he added. Other countries came forward “with new commitments for training Ukraine’s forces and sustaining its military systems”, Austin said but declined to say if the US will send Ukraine high-tech mobile rocket launchers, which it has requested. Significantly, Harpoon anti-ship missiles could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. Harpoons are cruise missiles that can skim the surface of the sea to target ships as far as 300km (187 miles) offshore, depending on the type. “The nature of the fight, as you’ve heard us describe a number of times is … really shaped by artillery in this phase,” Austin added. The Russia-appointed administration of Ukraine’s Kherson region will ask Moscow to set up a military base on its territory, Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency reports. Russia successfully seized Ukraine’s southern Kherson region in mid-March which is adjacent to Crimea, the peninsula which Moscow has controlled since 2014. It has since installed a new administration there and started introducing the Russian rouble as a currency with plans to integrate the region as part of Russian territory. There should be a Russian military base in the Kherson region,” Kirill Stremousov, the deputy head of what Russia calls the ‘civil-military regional administration’ of Kherson, told RIA. We will ask for this and this is what the whole population wants. This is essential and will be a guarantor of security for the region and its inhabitants.” Stremousov added: We do not plan to be a separate independent republic. Our main task is to be a subject within the Russian Federation.” Stremousov noted that any results from a referendum “will not be recognised by western countries anyway” and concluded that “holding it today is a waste of time”. “According to our plan for integration into the Russian Federation, we must complete the process of transition to all standards of Russian legislation by the end of the year, and only then we can decide on a referendum and our future status,” the deputy head of administration said. “The Russian language, along with Ukrainian, will become the state language in the Kherson region. The Russian language will become the main language for office work, communication and all issues of national importance. We do not prohibit the Ukrainian language and will not play any language stories in any way.” Outgoing Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte has sharply criticised Russian president Vladimir Putin for the killings of innocent civilians in Ukraine. “I kill criminals, I don’t kill children and the elderly,” Duterte said after acknowledging the leaders have been tagged as killers. Duterte, who openly calls Putin an idol and a friend, voiced his rebuke for the first time over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in remarks aired Tuesday and reported by the Associated Press. While stressing he was not condemning the Russian president, Duterte disagreed with Putin’s labelling of the invasion as a “special military operation,” and said it was really a full-scale war waged against “a sovereign nation.” “Many say that Putin and I are both killers. I’ve long told you Filipinos that I really kill. But I kill criminals, I don’t kill children and the elderly,” Duterte said in a televised weekly meeting with key Cabinet officials. “We’re in two different worlds.” Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia was working to replace goods imported from western countries, he said, and in future, would depend only on “reliable” countries not beholden to the west. If they [the west] want to offer something in terms of resuming relations, then we will seriously consider whether we will need it or not,” Lavrov said, according to a transcript on the foreign ministry’s website. Lavrov set down grievances with western countries that he said were determined to change the rules of international relations to Russia’s detriment. We must cease being dependent in any way on supplies of absolutely everything from the west for ensuring the development of critically important sectors for security, the economy or our homeland’s social sphere.” Lavrov said Moscow’s goal now is to further develop ties with China. Now that the west has taken a ‘dictator’s position’, our economic ties with China will grow even faster. In addition to direct revenue for the state budget, this is a chance to develop (Russia’s) far east and eastern Siberia.” China, he said, had information and communications technologies “that are in no way inferior to the west. A great deal here will ensure mutual benefits.” Lavrov said Russia would count on “only ourselves and on countries which have proved themselves reliable and do not ‘dance to some other piper’s music’. If western countries change their minds and propose some form of cooperation, we can then decide.” Speaking to Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency, Lavrov added: Now the centre of world development has shifted to Eurasia. At the moment, we have the most extensive network of partnerships in the Eurasian region. We must rely on them in the further development of our country, its transport, transit, and logistics capabilities. I am convinced that this is the right way.” “Our western partners have proved, and not for the first time, that they are incapable of negotiating,” he added. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while before my colleague martin Belam in London take the reins a little later in the day. Here are all the top lines so far: The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.” A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over the invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers were due to face war crimes trials, she said, and Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a Harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, said Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary. The new security packages included “critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”. Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. “Low-level” discussions were under way on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, said General Mark Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days”, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. Robert Habeck also told German broadcaster ZDF that the European Commission and the US were working on a proposal to cap global oil prices rather than pay “any price”. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain. The pictures released by Maxar Technologies seemingly back up claims from Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business there. The Seattle-based coffee company has 130 stores and nearly 2,000 employees in Russia. McDonalds is also pulling out," removing the “golden arches” from Moscow before leaving for good.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Putin’s invasion of Ukraine brings shame on Russia, G7 leaders say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/putins-actions-in-ukraine-bring-shame-on-russia-says-g7,2022-05-08T18:37:26Z,Statement to mark 77th anniversary of end of second world war condemns ‘an attack on feeding the world’,"Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine has brought shame on Russia and the sacrifices its people made to defeat Nazi Germany in the second world war, leaders of the G7 group of leading western economies have said in a statement marking the 77th anniversary of the end of the global conflict. The statement, made on Sunday after a video conference between the G7 leaders and the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, was intended as a rallying call by liberal democracies in advance of Russia’s 9 May Victory Day parade in Moscow. The G7 statement said: “Through its invasion of and actions in Ukraine since 2014, Russia has violated the international rules-based order, particularly the UN charter, conceived after the second world war to spare successive generations from the scourge of war. “President Putin and his regime now chose to invade Ukraine in an unprovoked war of aggression against a sovereign country. His actions bring shame on Russia and the historic sacrifices of its people.” The leaders also accused him of “an attack on feeding the world” if he did not comply with international law and end the blockade on Ukrainian food exports. The G7 said it had collectively provided Ukraine with $24bn (£19.5) for financial and material support since the war started. Separately, in a televised address to the German people, Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, vowed Germany would not be paralysed by fear nor allow Russia to dictate the terms of any peace deal in Ukraine. In the joint statement the G7 leaders said they would collectively end their dependence on Russian energy “in a timely and orderly way”, but no precise timetable was set, reflecting the continued divisions in Europe about the speed with which such a phaseout can be achieved. In a clarification of war aims, the G7 statement said: “Ukraine’s ultimate aim is to ensure full withdrawal of Russia’s military forces and equipment from the entire territory of Ukraine and to secure its ability to protect itself in the future.” Downing Street said that in his contribution to the G7 discussion, Boris Johnson urged his counterparts to supply the Ukrainians with “military equipment that allowed them to not just hold ground in Ukraine, but recapture it”. Johnson “agreed with G7 leaders that the world must intensify economic pressure on Putin in any way possible, and said the west must not allow the war to turn into a stalemate that only magnified suffering”, a Downing Street spokesperson said. Johnson also urged his G7 partners to “intensify their diplomatic lobbying of counterparts failing to apply pressure on President Putin’s war machine”, No 10 said. Talks between diplomats in Brussels continued on Sunday to try to secure EU wide unanimity on a timetable for a phaseout of Russian energy, but the discussions were described as hard going. Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic have been offered permission to continue importing Russian oil until the end of 2024, but they also want help securing new sources of oil and retooling their refineries. Budapest wants a five-year period to wean itself off Russian oil and says it will need a new pipeline connection with Croatia, which has access to the sea. The diplomatic activity came as the US first lady, Jill Biden, made a detour from her trip to Slovakia and Romania to visit refugees on an unannounced visit to Ukraine, where she met her Ukrainian counterpart, Olena Zelenska. On a busy day for VIP visits in Ukraine, the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, toured Irpin, a Kyiv suburb and scene of some of the worst early attacks by Russia. The president of the German Bundestag, Bärbel Bas, and the Croatian prime minister, Andrej Plenković, met Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Sunday. In the Kyiv metro, the Edge and Bono from U2, at the invitation of Zelenskiy, performed alongside a Ukrainian soldier. Bas is the most senior German politician to visit the capital. She took part in commemorative events on the anniversary of the end of the second world war, as well as discussing the vexed issue of German arms exports to Ukraine. It is expected that the German foreign minister, Annalea Baerbock, a surprise advocate of arms exports, will go to Ukraine shortly. Irpin’s mayor, Oleksandr Markushyn, posted pictures on an official social media channel with Trudeau, writing that the Canadian prime minister “came to Irpin to see with his own eyes all the horror that the Russian occupiers had done to our city”. Markushyn said Trudeau “saw – not military facilities – but burned and completely destroyed homes of Irpin residents, who until recently enjoyed life and had their own plans for the future”. On Monday Emmanuel Macron, the French president, will travel to Berlin for talks with Scholz and to make a major address.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian assault on eastern Ukraine threatens to encircle Sievierodonetsk,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/russian-assault-eastern-ukraine-sievierodonetsk-donbas,2022-05-25T12:50:08Z,Zelenskiy calls situation in Donbas ‘extremely difficult’ as Russia tries to carve up Ukrainian-held territory,"Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said delays in arrival of western arms to the frontline had left Kyiv “catastrophically short of heavy weapons”. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Haidai added that Russian forces were attempting to “completely destroy” the city of Sievierodonetsk in an attempt to conquer the Donbas region, near Russia’s border. “They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the Earth,” Haidai said on his Telegram channel. “At the moment, with the support of artillery, the Russian occupiers are attacking Sievierodonetsk,” Haidai added. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the situation in Donbas was “extremely difficult”, with the Russian army bringing its full force to bear. Footage from recent days from frontline areas, posted on social media, has depicted a constant barrage of artillery and rocket fire raining down on key roads and Ukrainian positions. Recent video footage posted by AFP photographer Aris Messinis in Donbas showed shells hitting close to a road in the country’s east and the constant sound of incoming artillery fire. After failing to seize Kyiv or Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, Russia is trying to take the rest of the separatist-claimed Donbas’s two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front. In the easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield as Russian forces have advanced from three directions to encircle them. Assessment of Russian operations by western analysts suggests that rather than encircle Ukrainian forces in one large and all-encompassing effort, Russia is attempting to carve up Ukrainian-held territory into several small encirclements to the same effect. The US-based thinktank the Institute for the Study of War said in its 24 May update that Russian troops “are instead attempting to secure smaller encirclements and focus on Sievierodonetsk”, adding that Ukrainian forces were also probably conducting a controlled withdrawal south-west of the town of Popasna to protect Ukrainian supply lines against Russian offensives. Russia appears to have deployed higher quality troops from a so-called operational manoeuvre group to spearhead the operation around Sievierdonestsk, with some reports suggesting that Russian aircraft were flying several hundred sorties a day in support of the attack. Russian forces also appear to be benefiting from better supply lines in the Luhansk region with Ukrainian officials appealing for more western heavy weapons – including multiple launch rocket systems – for their outgunned defenders. In the city of Sloviansk west of Donbas, many residents took advantage of what Ukraine said was a break in the Russian assault to leave. “My house was bombed, I have nothing,” said Vera Safronova, seated in a train carriage among the evacuees. Along with the eastern Donbas region, Moscow is also targeting southern Ukraine and has blockaded ships that would normally export Ukrainian grain and sunflower oil through the Black Sea, pushing up prices globally and threatening lives. Russia, which has blamed Ukraine and the west for the food crisis, said it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine but said western sanctions would need to be lifted in return. Three months into the invasion, Russia still has only limited gains to show for its worst military losses in decades, while much of Ukraine has suffered devastation as Moscow stepped up artillery strikes to compensate for its slow progress. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said it was deliberately advancing slowly in what it calls its “special operation” to avoid civilian casualties, comments Zelenskiy dismissed as “absolutely unreal”. “We will continue the special military operation until all the objectives have been achieved,” Shoigu told the Collective Security Treaty Organization, a Russian-led military alliance of former Soviet states. The secretary of Russia’s security council, Nikolai Patrushev, also said Moscow’s offensive would last as long as necessary. “We are not rushing to meet deadlines,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rishi Sunak can fight recession risks with a cost of living support package | Larry Elliott,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/08/rishi-sunak-can-fight-recession-risks-with-a-cost-of-living-support-package,2022-05-08T10:35:08Z,Pressure for summer mini-budget will increase as economic effects of Russia-Ukraine war take hold,"Less than three months after Russian troops moved across the border into Ukraine the economic implications of the war are gradually sinking in. There have been other conflicts since 1945 but it is hard to think of one that has had such a dramatic and sudden impact. The only real comparison is with the Yom Kippur war of 1973. Support for Ukraine has been widespread in the west, among governments and the public, but only now are the consequences of sanctions and embargos starting to be felt. This week, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England raised interest rates in the face of annual inflation rates heading towards 10%. The European Central Bank will follow suit in the months to come. The threat of recession is obvious. Central banks say they are powerless to prevent rising global energy prices from pushing up the cost of living but think they can prevent high inflation becoming embedded. The former chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont once said higher unemployment was a “price worth paying” to get inflation under control, and that sentiment lives on. Last year, central banks assumed inflationary pressure would be temporary. There would be bottlenecks as demand picked up as countries came out of lockdown and supply struggled to keep up, but any problems would soon go away. Analogies were drawn with the audience leaving a theatre at the end of a play: there is a crush at the exits but it doesn’t take long before everybody is out on the streets. Actually, things were a bit more complex than that, with more pent-up demand resulting from the lack of spending opportunities during the coronavirus pandemic than central banks thought and more impaired supply chains. The imbalance between demand and supply has since been exacerbated by two factors – the war in Ukraine and China’s zero-tolerance approach to Covid 19 – but it was already pushing up inflation in the second half of 2021. These global shocks are affecting countries in different ways. As the Bank’s governor, Andrew Bailey, pointed out this week, the US is facing what looks like a demand shock, with a tight labour market, strong consumer spending and less exposure to energy prices as a result of being a major gas producer. The euro area is suffering a supply shock because it has a weaker labour market than the US and is more exposed to the rise in energy prices. Britain has elements of both: it is suffering a supply shock from the rising cost of energy and food but, like the US, has low unemployment. Everywhere, though, the story is one of higher inflation, slower growth and hard choices for policymakers. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, has faced criticism for wanting to limit the damage to his country’s economy from the war. In truth, he is merely posing an obvious question: how much pain can governments impose on their populations before support begins to wane? That question is only to get more pertinent as the collateral damage mounts. For the moment, the impact of the war is being cushioned by the opening up of economies as the Omicron variant of Covid 19 becomes less of a threat. Unemployment will continue to fall in the US, the UK and the euro area for some months. The going gets tougher thereafter. The end of the cold war in the early 1990s allowed governments in the west to run down defence spending and reallocate the money elsewhere. Fewer tanks and warships meant more could be spent on health and education without taxes having to rise. If, as seems likely, the cold war is back, harder choices will need to be made, and at a time when ageing populations are intensifying pressures for higher spending. There are other long-term implications of the war. The EU is having to develop a new energy strategy on the hoof as it weans itself off Russian oil and gas. Long global supply chains look less attractive than they did pre-Covid, and self-sufficiency is back in vogue. Both factors threaten to lead to higher prices, at least in the short-term. Clearly, getting policy right in these circumstances is not easy and tricky decisions face central banks and finance ministries. Central banks will suffer a loss of credibility if they allow an inflationary spiral to take hold but monetary overkill that drives their economies deeper into recession won’t do much for their reputations either. The real onus, though, is on finance ministers because fiscal policy – tax and spending decisions – is more effective in the current circumstances than monetary policy. In the UK, Rishi Sunak, seems in no hurry to add to the limited support he provided in the spring statement, preferring to wait for the autumn budget to act. Pressure for a summer mini-budget is bound to increase, however, because by August a new energy price cap will be announced to come into force in October. This looks like adding a further £800 a year to the average household’s bill, taking it to about £2,800. Millions more will be driven into fuel poverty. It is not a question of if there is more help but how generous that support is and when it will be rolled out. It is unrealistic for governments to imagine that support for Ukraine will continue at its current elevated levels when dole queues start to lengthen and living standards really begin to be eroded. There is a quid pro quo here: if foreign policy is to remain hawkish towards Russia, then domestic policy has to turn more doveish to help those most affected by the economic consequences of the war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Questions over future of evacuated Azovstal fighters – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/17/russia-ukraine-war-bloodiest-battle-ends-as-ukrainian-fighters-evacuated-from-mariupol-steel-plant-live,2022-05-17T23:41:51Z,Duma appears to be trying to keep Azov battalion fighters out of prisoner swap deal; Ukraine blames Russia’s ‘stereotypical mindset’ for stop in talks,"Our live coverage of the Ukraine war is pausing for the time being, but you can find all of our reporting here. We will be back with a new blog in the coming hours. A little more on the stalled peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine, with some comments from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Reuters reports Lavrov said he believes no peace deal can be made if negotiators try to “transfer the dialogue” to focus on what the West had to say instead of the immediate situation in Ukraine. That rules out chances for progress in talks, he added. “We always say that we are ready for negotiations ... but we were given no other choice,” Lavrov said. Ukraine and Russia have held intermittent peace talks since the end of February 2022, just days after Russia invaded its neighbour, but there has been little communication between them in recent weeks. Here is a selection of images from Ukraine on day 83 of Russia’s invasion: ICC sends ‘largest ever’ investigative team to Ukraine The International Criminal Court on Tuesday has sent a 42-member team to Ukraine to probe alleged war crimes since the Russian invasion in what it called the largest such deployment in its history, AFP reports. The squad comprises investigators, forensic experts and support staff and will work with Ukrainian authorities, said Karim Khan, the chief prosecutor of the Hague-based ICC. “This represents the largest ever single field deployment by my office since its establishment,” ICC prosecutor Karim Khan said in a statement. The ICC was set up in 2002 to probe the world’s worst crimes. US considers move to block Russian debt payments The United States is considering blocking Russias ability to pay its US bondholders by allowing a key waiver to expire next week, a US administration official said on Tuesday, which could put Moscow closer to the brink of default, Reuters reports. Russia has so far managed to make its international bond payments despite Western sanctions, which have complicated the process of paying. The country has $40bn of international bonds and last month made a late U-turn by making overdue bond payments to avoid default. Russia has not defaulted on its external debt since the aftermath of its 1917 revolution and was rated investment grade up until its 24 February of Ukraine. Now Russia has a looming 25 May deadline when a US license allowing it to make payments is due to expire. US creates unit to document Russian ‘war crimes’ in Ukraine The US state department will create a new unit to research, document and publicise alleged war crimes by Russia in Ukraine. The Conflict Observatory will “capture, analyze, and make widely available evidence of Russia-perpetrated war crimes and other atrocities in Ukraine,” the department said. The Observatory will collect publicly and commercially available information, including what is seen on social media and commercial satellite imagery, for use in current and future civil and criminal legal processes. Nearly three months after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv says it has identified thousands of suspected war crimes cases. Most notorious have been the allegations murder of scores of civilians in Bucha, just outside Kyiv. The Observatory will create an online platform “to help refute Russia’s disinformation efforts and shine a light on abuses,” the department said. The fate of more than 260 Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed. Eight people have died and 12 wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. The regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched four missiles at around 5am local time on Tuesday. Two of the missiles hit buildings in the village, he said. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have stalled, according to both sides. Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said negotiations with Russia have been suspended, blaming Moscow’s “stereotypical mindset”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that virtually no peace talks are going on at the moment and blamed Ukraine for having “practically withdrawn” from the process. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, promised his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that French arms deliveries to Kyiv would intensify in the coming days, the Élysée said. Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” conversation with Macron where they discussed “the course of hostilities, the operation to rescue the military from Azovstal and the vision of the prospects of the negotiation process”. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Russian forces may have suffered “impressive losses” since their invasion of Ukraine. He told reporters: “If it is true that Russia has lost 15% of their troops since the beginning of the war, this is a world record of the losses of an army invading a country.” Borrell also said all EU member states will support Finland and Sweden in joining Nato. Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved a government proposal to join Nato, a day after Sweden confirmed its intention to join the alliance. Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, said he was sure both countries would overcome Turkish opposition to their historic membership bids. Niinistö and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, will meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday, the White House said. The leaders are expected to discuss Finland and Sweden’s Nato applications, European security and support for Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, it said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that Finland and Sweden joining Nato would probably make “not much difference”. The two Nordic countries “have been participating in Nato military exercises for many years,” Lavrov said. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said that by abandoning Russian energy supplies, Europe risked paying the most expensive energy prices in the world. Speaking at a meeting with domestic oil managers and government officials, Putin said it was impossible for some European countries to quickly ditch Russian oil. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy gave a surprise address to open the Cannes Film Festival in France. Over video, Zelensky said that “it’s necessary for cinema not to be silent”. In a rare diversion from the Kremlin’s official line, Russian TV aired an interview with military analyst Mikhail Khodarenok, who said Russia’s situation “will clearly get worse”. Russia has tried to hide the scale of its losses and setbacks in Ukraine, aggressively censoring and prosecuting any who question the Kremlin’s claims that all is going according to plan. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Lauren Aratani, Maanvi Singh In yesterday’s nightly address, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that the military and intelligence officers had begun the operation to rescue Ukrainian troops from Mariupol, but the the work needs “delicacy and time”. Meanwhile, he said, “we also maintain maximum diplomatic activity in other areas in the interests of Ukraine”. Zelenskiy said that in the mean time, Ukrainian troops are “repelling constant attacks in those areas where Russia is still trying to advance”, naming Severodonetsk and other cities in Donbas as main targets. “We do everything to protect our land and our people,” he said. Here’s the latest on Mariupol: Correction: This post was amended to reflect that Zelenskiy’s comments were from yesterday night, local time in Ukraine. In a rare diversion from the Kremlin’s official line, Russian TV aired an interview with Mikhail Khodarenok, a military analyst and retired colonel, during which he said that Russia’s situation “will clearly get worse” as Ukraine receives military assistance from the West. “Ultimate victory on the battlefield is determined by the high morale of troops who are spilling blood for the ideas they are ready to fight for,” he said, according to the BBC. “The biggest problem with [Russia’s] military and political situation...is that we are in total political isolation and the whole world is against us, even if we don’t want to admit it. We need to resolve this situation.” Russia has tried to hide the scale of its losses and setbacks in Ukraine, aggressively censoring and prosecuting any who question the Kremlin’s claims that all is going according to plan. But the realities have leaked through occasionally, angering the families of Russian soldiers in Ukraine, as the Guardian’s Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer report: One of Ukraine’s largest farming groups has called for an urgent solution to unblock the country’s Black Sea ports as exports of grain, sunflower and rapeseed are being held up by the Russian naval blockade, driving inflation and shortages around the world. G7 ministers have held urgent talks about trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, potentially fed with an army of 10,000 trucks making a five-day trip from Ukraine. John Rich, the chairman of MHP, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said: “If we had a UN agreement in place it would solve an enormous amount of issues.” But he said that without the war ending such a deal was unlikely, piling pressure on prices for grain and seeds used for cooking oil and ethanol around the world into next year. “We are now in a vicious cycle,” Rich said. “Normally what happens is that farmers cure high prices as [when prices go up] farmers produce more and prices collapse. This time it could be different,” Rich said pointing to a combination of climate change, the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, as well as fertiliser shortages which are hitting production around the world. He said the world could be looking at a “cascade of export bans”, following India’s block on the export of wheat and Indonesia’s block on palm oil exports, raising the prospect that “the whole concept of globalisation in food production is dead”. Exports from Ukraine, which produces as much as half the world’s sunflower seeds, a tenth of wheat and up to a fifth of barley and rapeseed, have been severely interrupted by the closure of Ukraine’s ports following Russia’s invasion. Only about 1m tonnes of grain and seed were exported in April compared with more than 5m tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds a month in a typical year. Before the war, about 80% of Ukraine’s grain and oilseeds were exported via the Black Sea but that route is now cut off, creating a bottleneck as farmers prepare to harvest the summer crops. Efforts are being made to increase the pace of exports, by increasing the use of trucks and improving rail capacity and links, which are hampered by differing track gauges in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. However, Rich said road and rail could replace little more than a quarter of the capacity that once flowed through Ukraine’s ports and would take time to develop.

The videos – released by the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic and Russia’s defence ministry – show people being carried on stretchers. The Guardian has been unable to verify the date or conditions under which this footage was shot The Economist has a great interactive on how powerful Vladimir Putin’s grasp on the media in Russia is, essentially controlling a huge propaganda machine. The story goes through what a typical Russian citizen is reading and watching as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. Here’s an excerpt: As Mr Putin’s regime shifts from a relatively open authoritarianism towards a more closed dictatorship, its propaganda is changing, too. Television hosts and guests present the “special military operation” as part of a grander conflict in defence of Russia. State media have long intoned about the West’s supposed intention to undermine Russia and Mr Putin’s efforts to protect the motherland. But where propaganda once sought mostly to breed passivity, cast doubt on reality and discourage political participation, it increasingly seeks to mobilise popular support for Mr Putin’s war, by convincing people that Russia is under attack and victory is the only way out. “The old rules of authoritarian life are breaking down, active participation is being demanded,” says Greg Yudin, a sociologist. Dramatic video shows a community center in Derhachi, near Kharkiv, that has been puvlarized by Russian missiles. The community center was handing out humanitarian aid to local residents. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy just gave a surprise address to open the Cannes Film Festival in France. Over video, Zelensky said that “it’s necessary for cinema not to be silent”, according to the Hollywood Reporter. Zelenskiy cited several movies, including Charlie Chaplin’s The Great Dictator and said that such movies were “horrific documentaries and newsreels”. But, ironically, “the most brutal dictators of the 20th century loved cinema”. “I’m sure that the dictator will lose,” Zelesnkiy said at the end of the address. “Glory to Ukraine.” NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg will meet with ambassadors from Finnish and Sweden tomorrow, according to a NATO press release. Stoltenberg will meet with Klaus Korhonen and Axel Wernhoff, the Finnish and Swedish ambassadors to NATO. Earlier today, Swedish prime minister Magdalena Andersson said that the two countries planned to formally submit applications to join NATO on Wednesday. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Léonie Chao-Fong. Bloomberg is reporting that the US government is preparing to block Russia from being able to pay off debt held by US bondholders, a move that would lead Russia closer to default on its debt. In early April, the US government banned Russia from using money held in US banks as a way to financially squeeze the Kremlin. The last time the Russian government defaulted was in 1917 during the Bolshevik Revolution. Defaulting will make it harder for the Russian government to borrow money in the future, potentially creating a dire financial situation in the country. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The fate of more than 260 Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed. Eight people have died and 12 wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service. The regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched four missiles at around 5am local time on Tuesday. Two of the missiles hit buildings in the village, he said. Peace talks between Russia and Ukraine have stalled, according to both sides. Ukrainian negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said negotiations with Russia have been suspended, blaming Moscow’s “stereotypical mindset”. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that virtually no peace talks are going on at the moment and blamed Ukraine for having “practically withdrawn” from the process. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, promised his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that French arms deliveries to Kyiv would intensify in the coming days, the Élysée said. Zelenskiy said he had a “long and meaningful” conversation with Macron where they discussed “the course of hostilities, the operation to rescue the military from Azovstal and the vision of the prospects of the negotiation process”.

That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Lauren Aratani. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you for reading. France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, promised his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that French arms deliveries to Kyiv would intensify in the coming days, the Élysée said. In a phone call with Zelenskiy held earlier today, Macron said France was ready to respond to additional demands for help from Ukraine, the French presidential office said in a statement. Macron confirmed that arms deliveries by France will “continue and increase in intensity in the days and weeks to come, as will the delivery of humanitarian aid,” the statement said. Macron also told Zelenskiy that Ukraine’s application to join the EU would be “examined” during a European Council session in June. During the conversation, which lasted for an hour and 10 minutes, the leaders also discussed the evacuations of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol as well as “the challenge of food security and possible ways to allow exports of Ukrainian grains, which a large part of the world depends on for its food”. Zelenskiy earlier tweeted that he had a “long and meaningful” conversation with Macron. US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has spoken with the wife of basketball star, Brittney Griner, who has been detained in Russia since February, according to a US state department official. Griner, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, was arrested at a Moscow airport allegedly in possession of vape cartridges that contained cannabis oil. If found guilty, she faces up to 10 years in prison. The US has said the 31-year-old was wrongfully detained and has assigned diplomats to work for her release. Blinken told Cherelle Griner on Saturday that her wife’s release is a top priority for the Biden administration and that the US is working day and night on the case, the official said. On Friday, Griner’s lawyer, Alexander Boikov, said her pre-trial detention in Russia has been extended by one month. Seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers have left the Azovstal steel works in the port city of Mariupol and arrived at a former penal colony in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka near Donetsk, Reuters reports. The Ukrainian fighters, many of them members of the Azov Battalion, will be questioned by the Russian investigative committee, according to Russia’s state-owned news agency Tass. The questioning will be done as part of the Russian investigation into what Moscow calls “criminal cases concerning Ukrainian regime crimes”, Tass added. Sweden and Finland will formally submit simultaneous requests to join Nato on Wednesday, the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, has said, in a seismic shift in Europe’s security architecture after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “Finland and Sweden have agreed to go through this entire process hand in hand, and we will tomorrow file the application together,” Andersson told a joint news conference with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, in Stockholm. “Membership of Nato strengthens security in Sweden but also in the Baltic Sea region,” Andersson said. The fact that we are applying together with Finland means that we can contribute to security in northern Europe. The announcement came as the White House said Niinistö, and Andersson would meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday to discuss their bids to join the US-led mutual defence alliance and European security more broadly. Finland, which shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, has remained neutral or non-aligned since the end of the second world war, while Sweden has stayed out of military alliances for more than two centuries. Both had long seen Nato membership as an unnecessary provocation of Russia. Andersson said the simultaneous applications reflected the brutal impact of “Russia’s illegal war” on Ukraine and the Nordic neighbours’ common history, traditions, values and culture. “In recent months, it has also become clear that Sweden’s and Finland’s security are closely linked,” she said. Niinistö said Russia’s onslaught on Ukraine had “changed everything”, adding that Finnish and Swedish Nato membership meant the Nordic region would now be “a bastion not just of democracy, welfare and human rights – but also of security”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he held a “long and meaningful” phone call with his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, to discuss the issue of fuel supplies to Ukraine and defence support from France. Zelenskiy tweeted that he told Macron about “the course of hostilities, the operation to rescue the military from Azovstal and the vision of the prospects of the negotiation process”. The two leaders also spoke about the “preparation of the sixth package of sanctions, possible ways to export Ukrainian agricultural products”, Zelenskiy said. They also held a “substantive discussion of our application for the status of a candidate for EU membership”, he added. It is almost 7.30pm in Kyiv.

Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The EU’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said Russian forces may have suffered “impressive losses” since their invasion of Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, Borrell said: I wouldn’t dare to make an hypothesis about how long Russia can resist... If it is true that Russia has lost 15% of their troops since the beginning of the war, this is a world record of the losses of an army invading a country. He added that the European Union “will not let” Ukraine run out of military equipment, Reuters reports. The International Criminal Court has sent a team of investigators and forensic experts to Ukraine to probe alleged war crimes in what it has called the “largest-ever” deployment in its history. The ICC team will “advance our investigations into crimes falling into the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court and provide support to Ukrainian national authorities”, said Karim Khan, the ICC’s chief prosecutor. Investigators will chase up leads and collect witness testimony “relevant to military attacks”, Khan said in a statement. They would also work with Ukrainian authorities to “strengthen chain of custody with respect to hard evidence,” he said. Khan continued: Now more than ever we need to show the law in action. It is essential that we demonstrate to survivors and the families of victims that international law is relevant to their experience...in order to bring them some measure of solace through the process of justice. Khan announced an investigation into alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity just four days after Russian troops invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory, Shaun Walker and Andrew Roth report. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said they could be tried or even executed. MPs in Russia’s State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are “terrorists”. Russia called the Azovstal operation a mass surrender, while the Ukrainian army said the soldiers defending the steel plant had “performed their combat task” and that the main goal was now to save their lives. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address. For weeks, hundreds of troops have been holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks, as Russian forces took control of the rest of the city after turning much of it into an uninhabitable wasteland. Many of those stuck at Azovstal had serious injuries, with limited medical care and dwindling supplies. In the last few weeks, civilians who had also taken cover in the plant were rescued after a deal was brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow them to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Ukraine had been pushing for a deal that would also allow the fighters to retreat to Ukrainian-controlled areas, or for their evacuation to a neutral country. However, with that not forthcoming, Ukrainian officials announced in the early hours of Tuesday that the defence of the plant was in effect over. “This was the only option,” said the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, on Tuesday. At least seven buses carrying surrendered Ukrainian fighters left the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, escorted by pro-Russian armed forces, Reuters reports. Some of the Ukrainian fighters being transported did not appear to be wounded, according to a witness. Russia’s prosecutor general has asked the supreme court to recognise Ukraine’s Azov regiment as a “terrorist organisation”, Interfax news agency reported, citing the Russian justice ministry’s website. Russia’s supreme court is scheduled to hear the case on 26 May, Interfax reports. The Russian state Duma appears to be moving toward trying to prevent Ukrainian soldiers from the Azov battalion being included in any prisoner swap. The Azov Regiment, a one-time nationalist militia integrated into Ukraine’s National Guard, has been alleged by Moscow to be the main perpetrator of anti-Russian nationalism from which Russia has claimed it needs to protect Ukraine’s Russian-speakers from. Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the State Duma, said its members were “Nazi criminals” who should not be included in prisoner exchanges. “They are war criminals and we must do everything to bring them to justice,” he said. Reuters reports the Duma website said he had asked the defence and security committees to prepare an instruction to that effect. At the same time, the Telegram channel of the RIA news agency is carrying this short news snap, citing Russia’s justice ministry: Supreme court on 26 May to consider case on recognising Ukrainian Azov battalion as a terrorist organisation and banning its activities in Russia. With its urban areas sprawling along the coastline of the Sea of Azov in the shape of a comma, the siege of Mariupol came to define one of the most brutal episodes in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and viewed as one of the Kremlin’s key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. The capture of Mariupol loomed large in the Kremlin’s imagination for propaganda purposes too: as the home base of the Azov brigade, which at its 2014 inception, when the war in Donbas began, included far-right volunteers, some with neo-Nazi affiliations. (In recent years the brigade has been fully integrated into the Ukrainian military). It was the sheer levels of violence inflicted on the city and on its civilian population day after day, however, that has kept Mariupol in the headlines. The few who have been able to enter the city – including the International Committee for the Red Cross – have described conditions in the city as “apocalyptic”.

ns is especially high, will not be able to do this for a long time, to ditch our oil. Speaking at a televised meeting with domestic oil managers and government officials, Putin also said that western sanctions and a possible embargo on Russian oil had resulted in an increase in global oil prices. He also said that western sanctions had stoked inflation across Europe itself. At the same time, the Polish president Andrzej Duda told a joint media conference with his Hungarian counterpart Katalin Novák that Hungary would struggle to diversify its energy supply. “Please remember that it will be hard for the Hungarians to diversify if European recovery funds remain blocked,” Duda said, adding that he hoped a sixth package of EU sanctions on Russia could be agreed on. Finland’s parliament has overwhelmingly approved a proposal to apply for membership in the Nato alliance. The proposal was passed with 188 votes in favour and eight against. Finland is expected to sign a formal application and file it to Nato headquarters in the coming days, along with Sweden, where its government announced a similar bid yesterday. It comes as the White House announced that the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdelena Andersson will meet with the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday to discuss their Nato applications. Ukraine’s top presidential adviser and negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said negotiations with Russia on resolving the conflict have been suspended, blaming Moscow’s “stereotypical mindset”. Since the two delegations met in Istanbul in late March, there have been “no significant changes, no progress”, he said. Podolyak told reporters: Objectively speaking, the negotiation process is suspended. Why? There are several reasons. Russia does not demonstrate the key – the understanding of today’s processes in the world and (Russia’s) extremely negative role. Russia does not understand that the war is “no longer going on according to the rules, their plans, and schedule”, he said, while at the same time the “resistance of Ukraine, the professional resistance just grows, that’s why there’s no way Russia achieves its goals”. He said the political elite in Russia are afraid of telling the truth and were choosing to “continue negotiations as an element of their propaganda only for domestic use”. Podolyak added: In my opinion, it’s a strategic goal of Russians: All or nothing. He said the Ukrainian delegation does not consider the issue “to withdraw or not to withdraw” from the negotiation process as only expediency and specificity matter at the current stage, adding: If there is specificity, political negotiations will continue. Podolyak’s remarks to the media come after Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said that virtually no peace talks are going on at the moment. Russia’s Interfax news agency reported that Rudenko told journalists in Nizhny Novgorod: No, the negotiations are not continuing. Ukraine has practically withdrawn from the negotiating process. Russia’s defence ministry said 265 Ukrainian fighters had surrendered at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol. More than 50 were heavily wounded, the ministry said, adding that those in need of medical care were transferred to a hospital in the town of Novoazovsk, east of Mariupol. Russian authorities have released images of what it claims are wounded Ukrainian servicemen who left the steel plant and who are now in Russian custody. Eight people have died and 12 wounded after Russia launched a missile strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s state emergency service, Reuters reports. The regional governor, Viacheslav Chaus, said Russia launched four missiles at around 5am local time. Two of the missiles hit buildings in the village, he said. In a video posted on Facebook, Chaus said: In the morning, the enemy fired missiles at the village of Desna. […] According to preliminary reports, we have those killed and many wounded. It has not been able to independently verify these claims. Here are some lines from Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, during his regular briefing where he said it would be “outright theft” for G7 countries and EU to seize Russia’s frozen reserves and spend them on behalf of Ukraine. It comes after Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, said he was open to the idea of seizing Russian state assets to finance the reconstruction of Ukraine. Proposals to this effect were already being discussed among the G7 and in the EU, Lindner added. Peskov said no one had told Russia of such an initiative, which he said would be “illegal, blatant and of course requiring an appropriate response … It would be, in fact, outright theft”. The Kremlin spokesperson also told reporters that Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol would be treated “in accordance with international standards”. All EU member states will support Finland and Sweden in joining Nato, the bloc’s foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said. EU representatives will discuss the intentions of both Nordic countries to join the alliance, for which they will receive “strong support”, Borrell told reporters before a meeting of the EU foreign affairs council, adding: They will receive a strong support I’m sure from all member states, because it increases our unity and it makes us stronger. He added that he “hopes” Nato will overcome Turkey’s objections to Sweden and Finland’s bid to join the alliance: I am sure the council will support extremely … the membership of Sweden and Finland to Nato. I know that Turkey has put some objections. I hope Nato will be able to overcome them. Meanwhile, Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, said his country and Sweden will be able to reach an agreement with Turkey over its objectives. In an address to Sweden’s parliament, Niinistö said: Statements from Turkey have very quickly changed and become harder during the last few days. But I am sure that, with the help of constructive discussions, we will solve the situation. Growing numbers of refugees are being made homeless, and in many cases destitute, following relationship breakdowns with their Homes for Ukraine hosts in the UK, community organisations have warned. Some predict the system could crash entirely amid reports of Ukrainian refugees being asked to leave the homes of their sponsors with as little as one day’s notice, leaving them with no option but to be referred to local authorities as homeless, or if they can afford to, attempt to seek last-minute rented accommodation. Community leaders said it was happening among typically well-meaning hosts who may have failed to anticipate the enormity of the commitment until refugees arrived in their homes, adding to the stress and trauma of the refugees. Other factors cited include costs, personality and cultural clashes, hosts not setting house rules, misunderstandings and communication issues. Iryna Terlecky, a board member of the Association of Ukrainians in Great Britain (AUGB), said: “Our community is seeing these cases frequently and our perception is that they’re increasing.” They also report similar issues among those who arrived on the Ukraine family scheme – either due to space issues or relationship breakdowns. “We are finding that sponsorship relationships are breaking down – in spite of the very clear desire of people to help,” Terlecky said. A 43-year-old Ukrainian woman told the Guardian she was left homeless, terrified and not knowing where to turn after being asked to leave by her Homes for Ukraine hosts after little more than a week. Following Russia’s invasion she fled her 22nd-floor flat in Kyiv for Spain but she found it difficult to find work. She met her UK hosts, a couple from Exeter, on Facebook who arranged her flights and documentation. At first, she said, they all got on well and she felt “loved and cared for”. But their dynamic shifted dramatically when she went to visit a man she had met online. Her hosts have accused her of lying. “It’s a terrible feeling,” she said, speaking from emergency council accommodation in a hotel. “You feel really happy, loved and cared for and then you feel like you’ve been thrown from a high-rise building to the ground.” Read Miranda Bryant’s full article: Homes for Ukraine: refugees being left homeless, UK community groups warn More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said late on Monday that 53 heavily wounded soldiers were evacuated to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk and that more than 200 others were transported through a corridor to Olenivka. An “exchange procedure” will take place to bring evacuees home, she said. It was unclear how many soldiers remained in the steelworks or the exact number who left, but Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We hope to save the lives of our boys. I want to underline: Ukraine needs its Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle,” he said in a video statement. Ukraine deputy PM Iryna Vereshchuk this morning said of the wounded servicemen: “After their condition stabilises, we will exchange them for Russian prisoners of war. We are working on the next stages of the humanitarian operation.” Russia-backed separatists claimed this morning that 256 Ukrainian servicemen who had been in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant “have surrendered” and that 51 were wounded. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Finland and Sweden joining Nato would probably make “not much difference” as the two countries had long participated in the alliance’s military drills. Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko has said virtually no peace talks are going on at the moment, accusing Ukraine of withdrawing from the process. Lviv’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has said overnight a missile hit the Yavoriv regional branch of the Lviv railway, and infrastructure was damaged. Kozytskyi also claims Ukraine’s air defence shot down three cruise missiles last night. The governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, has claimed that Russian forces suppressed fire from Ukraine on the Russian village of Alekseevka. Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is due to appeal against a nine-year prison sentence he was handed in March on charges that he and his allies say are politically motivated Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted that he has held talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. US treasury secretary Janet Yellen called for US allies to step up financial support for Ukraine on Tuesday, saying that funds announced so far would not be sufficient for the country’s short-term needs as it battles a Russian invasion. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to Léonie Chao-Fong. Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko has said virtually no peace talks are going on at the moment, accusing Ukraine of withdrawing from the process. The Russian Interfax news agency reports that Rudenko told journalists in Nizhny Novgorod “No, the negotiations are not continuing. Ukraine has practically withdrawn from the negotiating process.” US treasury secretary Janet Yellen called for US allies to step up financial support for Ukraine on Tuesday, saying that funds announced so far would not be sufficient for the country’s short-term needs as it battles a Russian invasion. “Ukraine’s financing needs are significant,” Yellen said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Brussels Economic Forum, adding that the country’s government continued to function, due to the ingenuity and bravery of its officials. “In the months until tax collection can resume at pace, Ukraine needs budget funding to pay soldiers, employees and pensioners, as well as to operate an economy that meets its citizens’ basic needs,” Reuters reports Yellen said. “In short order, it will need to turn to repairing and restoring critical utilities and services.” While Ukraine would eventually need “massive support” for reconstruction and recovery on the scale of the post-second world war Marshall Plan for Europe, the country would have to take this “one step at a time.” “What is clear is that the bilateral and multilateral support announced so far will not be sufficient to meet Ukraine’s basic needs,” Yellen said. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has posted that he has held talks with German chancellor Olaf Scholz. Zelenskiy said: Held productive talks with Olaf Scholz. Discussed the situation on the frontline, further pressure on Russia, sanctions increase, the prospects of peace. Appreciate German support, including defensive one. We count on further German assistance on Ukraine’s path to full membership in the EU. On Telegram, Ukraine deputy PM Iryna Vereshchuk has posted that the process of getting Ukrainian forces out of Azovstal plant in Mariupol. She writes: Azovstal: humanitarian operation continues. In the interests of saving lives, 52 of our severely wounded servicemen were evacuated yesterday. After their condition stabilises, we will exchange them for Russian prisoners of war. We are working on the next stages of the humanitarian operation. God willing, everything will be fine. Earlier Reuters carried a line that Russia-backed separatists had claimed this morning that 256 Ukrainian servicemen who had been in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant “have surrendered” and that 51 were wounded. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has said that Finland and Sweden joining Nato would probably make “not much difference” as the two countries had long participated in the alliance’s military drills. “Finland and Sweden, as well as other neutral countries, have been participating in Nato military exercises for many years,” Lavrov said, Reuters reports. “NATO takes their territory into account when planning military advances to the East. So in this sense there is probably not much difference. Let’s see how their territory is used in practice in the North Atlantic alliance.” The governor of Russia’s Kursk region, Roman Starovoit, has said on Telegram that Russian forces suppressed fire from Ukraine on the Russian village of Alekseevka. The village is just over the border of Ukraine’s north-eastern Sumy region. Starovoit said three private houses were damaged as well as a school building. The governor said assistance would be provided to the residents of the shelled village. You may have seen the report from my colleague Daniel Boffey over the weekend about Igor Pedin, the 61-year-old who took a 140-mile journey from the besieged port city of Mariupol to the relative safety of the city of Zaporizhzhia. He expressed concerns about the health of the dog who made the journey with him, telling the Guardian: “She is lame on the front right leg and she doesn’t let me see what’s wrong with her leg. She always nips me when I want to look at her paw … Zhu-Zhu now reacts very badly to sounds. When she hears sharp sounds, she constantly shudders and jumps aside. The Guardian has been inundated with emails from people who wanted to help out Igor Pedin and Zhu-Zhu, and a crowdfunder has been set up to help them both here. You can read more about Pedin’s journey and his fears for his dog Zhu-Zhu here: Ukrainian who walked 140 miles to safety fears for his canine companion Here are some more of the latest images that have been sent to us from Ukraine and beyond over the newswires. Lviv’s mayor, Andriy Sadovyi, has just posted some additional information about that attack on the railway in the west of Ukraine. He said on Telegram: In one of the villages of Yavoriv district, the wreckage of the rocket partially damaged the railway infrastructure. Windows flew in the surrounding houses. And all this in a 20km zone to the border with the European Union. This was indeed one of the largest attacks on the Lviv region in terms of the number of missiles. It is difficult to predict what will happen next. So go to the shelter! He also implored citizens not to give away crucial information, posting: Do not film missile flights or air defence operations. Such videos are needed by Moscow. Don’t be like the Russians, please. Lviv’s governor, Maksym Kozytskyi, has posted to Telegram that overnight a missile hit the Yavoriv regional branch of the Lviv railway, and infrastructure was damaged. Kozytskyi also claims that Ukraine air defence shot down three cruise missiles last night. The claims have not been independently verified. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, the governor of Sumy in the north-east of Ukraine, has posted to Telegram that Okhtyrka was struck by Russian missiles overnight. He said: Five Russian missiles landed on civilian targets and caused a lot of damage. Warehouses caught fire. The shockwave damaged the front door of the two-storey building, and people were trapped inside. Many private houses were affected. The windows in the church were broken. The “Fairy Tale” Kindergarten also suffered. This is the same one that was bombed by the racists in the first days of the war, when people died here. At least five people have been injured in today’s attack on the city. The claims have not been independently verified. Russia has repeatedly insisted its attacks only target the military and military infrastructure. This is Martin Belam taking on the live blog, you can message me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is due to appeal against a nine-year prison sentence he was handed in March on charges that he and his allies say are politically motivated, AFP reports. The news agency writes: His hearing on Tuesday comes as Russian authorities seek to silence remaining government critics and Moscow pushes on with its military campaign in neighbouring Ukraine, with thousands killed and 10 million displaced. A vocal critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin, Navalny in late March had his jail time extended to nine years after he was found guilty of embezzlement and contempt of court. He is already serving two-and-a-half years in a prison 100 kilometres east of Moscow for violating parole on old fraud charges. On Tuesday, he will appeal against the extension of his jail term, joining the hearing at a Moscow court via video link from his prison colony. If his new sentence comes into force, the 45-year-old opposition politician will be transferred to a strict-regime penal colony, which will place him in much harsher conditions. The new sentence will replace the old one – that he was handed in February last year – meaning Navalny will remain behind bars for another eight years. As part of the new charges, investigators accused Navalny of stealing for personal use several million dollars’ worth of donations that were given to his political organisations. The evacuation of Ukrainian fighters from Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant, their last remaining redoubt in the city, began on Monday. Here are some images from that evacuation: A village in Russia’s western province of Kursk bordering Ukraine came under Ukrainian fire on Tuesday, regional governor Roman Starovoit said, according to Reuters, but there were no injuries, although three houses and a school were hit. Russian border guards returned fire to quell the shooting from large-calibre weapons on the border village of Alekseyevka, Starovoit wrote on the messaging app Telegram. More on the theme of Russian disenchantment with the war from the Guardian’s own Moscow correspondents Andrew Roth and Pjotr Sauer. They report that as more and more information has leaked out about the scale of Russia’s losses in Ukraine, it has angered the families of soldiers and discouraged even previous supporters of the invasion. Here’s an extract from their report: “I look at my government totally different since the war started,” said Tatyana Efremenko,39, whose son Nikita Efremenko was a conscript on the Moskva missile cruiser when it was sunk in a Ukrainian missile strike one month ago. She is still searching for her son. “There are some very harsh things I would like to say about our leadership, but maybe best if I don’t because they would put me in prison for it.” In Russian-controlled east Ukraine, wives of fighters have complained on camera that their husbands were left behind as Russian soldiers retreated across the border near Kharkiv. “They aren’t deserters, just those who managed to get away with their lives,” one woman yelled at a local official. Kyiv has said that it has the remains of thousands of Russian soldiers, but Moscow won’t accept them because that would force it to admit the high death toll in the war. As evidence of the Bilohorivka rout became clear over the last week, even some pro-Russian cheerleaders appeared to be losing faith in the wisdom of the country’s military leadership. “Until we know the name of the ‘military genius’ who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn’t answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army,” wrote Vladlen Tatarzky, the pseudonym used by a Russian blogger and former soldier who has more than 300,000 subscribers on Telegram. He has generally supported the war. “How can one not remember comrade Stalin here, who despite the difficult military situation was not afraid to take difficult personnel decisions? If this isn’t done, then no mobilisation will save us.” Read on here: The scale of the damage left behind by Russian troops north of Kyiv illustrates Russian willingness to use artillery on inhabited areas, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update, adding that Moscow is likely to rely more on artillery in the Donbas in coming weeks. In the Chernihiv region north of Kyiv, approximately 3,500 buildings are estimated to have been destroyed or damaged during Russia’s abandoned advance towards the Ukrainian capital. 80% of the damage has been caused to residential buildings. The scale of this damage indicates Russia’s preparedness to use artillery against inhabited areas, with minimal regard to discrimination or proportionality. Russia has likely resorted to an increasing reliance on indiscriminate artillery bombardment due to a limited target acquisition capability, and an unwillingness to risk flying combat aircraft routinely beyond its own frontlines. In the coming weeks, Russia is likely to continue to rely heavily on massed artillery strikes as it attempts to regain momentum in its advance in the Donbas. Russia is conducting its main combat efforts in the Donetsk region, Ukraine’s general staff has said in its 6am update, claiming that Ukrainian forces had repulsed 11 attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk over the past 24 hours, destroying equipment including five tanks, one Tor anti-aircraft missile system, six artillery systems, and 12 armoured combat vehicles. It also said Russian aircraft had “destroyed civilian and military infrastructure in the Eastern Operational Zone and industrial facilities deep in Ukraine” without giving any more details. In Kharkiv, where Ukrainian forces have reportedly driven back Russian forces to the Russian border, the “enemy’s main efforts are focused on maintaining their positions and preventing the advance of our troops.” The general staff also said it was compiling a separate report on the “total losses of the enemy” which would be published soon. It has been very difficult to verify the scale of Russian losses in the war. Moscow last released casualty data in late March, admitting that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3,825 wounded in the first month of the war. The government has not released any more information on casualties in the last month and a half, except to say that they were “significant”. Western estimates have been 10 or even 20 times as high, with some suggesting that Russia has lost more than 30,000 soldiers since the beginning of the war. A surprisingly candid assessment from a Russian analyst on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, with subtitles provided by the BBC’s Francis Scarr – fascinating viewing if you have five minutes to watch it. Mikhail Khodaryonok argues that Russian reports of demoralisation among Ukrainian troops are just individual cases and not indicative of a general mood. In fact, he says, Ukrainians are highly motivated and ready to die for their country, which he says is a “component of an army’s high combat readiness, one of the most important components.” He also warns against “sabre-rattling with missiles in Finland’s direction ... after all the main deficiency of our military-political position is that, in a way, we are in full geopolitical isolation and that, however much we would hate to admit this, virtually the entire world is against us.” A bit more from the ISW assessment, which says there is growing friction between Russian occupation administrations and pro-Russian collaborators in occupied areas of Ukraine, while inside Russia military bloggers are increasingly in-line with western assessments of Russian military failures. Russian forces in Zaporizhia, are having “serious conflicts” with collaborators due to “interpersonal power conflicts,” in the Zaporizhia region, the US-based think tank cites the region’s military administrations as saying. A well-known collaborator in Zaporizhia accused the Russian-installed governor of the area of stealing his 10,000 ruble compensation. Advisor to the Mayor of Mariupol Petro Andryshchenko additionally claimed that relatives of those mobilized into the forces of the Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) are holding a mass protest against mobilization in Donetsk City. While ISW cannot independently verify these claims, such discontent amongst occupation elements suggests a general lack of planning by Russian authorities in occupied areas, now compounded by increasingly evident Russian losses. The ISW meanwhile predicted that the “continued disenchantment of pro-Russian milbloggers with the Russian war effort may fuel dissatisfaction in Russia itself, especially if Moscow continues to press recruitment and conscription efforts that send poorly-trained cannon-fodder to the front lines.” One such blogger, Igor Strelkov, claimed that the Russian offensive to take Donbas has ultimately failed and that “not a single large settlement “has been liberated. Strelkov even noted that the capture of Rubizhne [a city in Luhansk] is relatively insignificant because it happened before the new offensive in Donbas had begun. Strelkov stated that Russian forces are unlikely to liberate Donbas by the summer and that Ukrainian troops will hold their positions around Donetsk City. Strelkov notably claimed that Russian failures thus far have not surprised him because the intent of Russian command has been so evident throughout the operation that Ukrainian troops are aware of exactly how to best respond and warns that Russian troops are fighting to the point of exhaustion under “rules proposed by the enemy.” The Russian withdrawal from around Kharkiv is different from previous Russian withdrawals from around Kyiv and other cities, when they pulled back to Russian territory, in that they are trying to retain a position in Ukraine, the Institute for the Study of War think tank writes in its latest assessment of the conflict. The Russian grouping around Kharkiv City is notably trying to hold the border and prevent Ukrainian troops from advancing further north. Russian troops may seek to retain positions in Ukraine and continue artillery strikes on Ukrainian positions in order to prevent Ukrainian forces from getting into tube or rocket-artillery range of the outskirts of Belgorod, a major city in Russia and a key hub of the Russian military effort. The Russians might alternatively hope to conduct a counter-counter-offensive to push back south toward Kharkiv, although such an effort is highly unlikely to succeed. More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, said late on Monday that 53 heavily wounded soldiers were evacuated to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk and that more than 200 others were transported through a corridor to Olenivka. An “exchange procedure will take place” to bring evacuees home, she said. It was unclear how many soldiers remained in the steel plant, but Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We hope to save the lives of our boys”. “I want to underline: Ukraine needs its Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle,” he said in a video statement. The evacuation is likely to mark the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. For Ukrainians, the Azovstal plant has become a symbol of resistance, with hundreds of troops continuing to fight on there even after the rest of the city had fallen to Russian forces. Six hundred troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. The general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said that the soldiers defending the steel plant had fulfilled their combat mission. “The supreme military command ordered the commanders of the units stationed at Azovstal to save the lives of the personnel,” the general staff said in a statement on its Facebook account. “Efforts to rescue defenders who remain on the territory of Azovstal continue.” Read on here: Hello, this is Helen Livingstone, bringing you the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Here’s a recap of the latest: The evacuation of wounded Ukrainian troops from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol is under way, president Volodomyr Zelenskiy confirmed, with more than 260 fighters transported out of the plant. The troops have fulfilled their combat mission, the general staff of the armed forces said. Ukraine’s deputy defense minister has said an “exchange procedure will take place” to bring evacuees home. Ukraine’s Joint Forces Task Force said on Monday that 20 civilians, including a child, were killed in Russian shelling in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Western military sources say that Vladimir Putin is involved in the war in Ukraine “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”. The Russian leader is reportedly so personally involved he is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas. Ukrainian officials claimed that troops counter-attacking against Russian forces in the country’s north-east had pushed them back from the city of Kharkiv and advanced as far as the border with Russia. Russian forces have shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. After Sweden and Finland yesterday confirmed plans to join Nato, Sweden is seeking to quell Turkish opposition by sending diplomats to the country. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has said Turkey will not approve the bids, and that delegations from the countries should not bother coming. Vladimir Putin said Russia had “no problems” with Finland and Sweden. “And so in this sense there is no immediate threat to Russia from an expansion to include these countries,” Putin said. The comments appeared to mark a major shift in rhetoric, after years of casting Nato enlargement as a direct threat to Russia’s security. However he did say that the expansion of military infrastructure on their territory would demand a reaction from Moscow. Hungary has been accused of “holding the EU hostage” over its refusal to agree an oil embargo against Russia, as the bloc struggles to reach consensus on its latest sanctions aimed at eroding the Kremlin’s ability to wage war. American fast-food giant McDonald’s will exit the Russian market and sell its business in the increasingly isolated country, the company said on Monday. Meanwhile," the Moscow city government is to take over a factory belonging to the French carmaker Renault and use it to revive the Soviet-era Moskvitch in Russia’s first major nationalization of a foreign company during its war in Ukraine.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Paranoid dictator’: Russian journalists fill pro-Kremlin site with anti-war articles,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/09/russian-journalists-pro-kremlin-site-lenta-anti-war-articles,2022-05-09T13:14:12Z,Articles published on Lenta.ru on Victory Day accuse Putin of waging ‘bloodiest war of 21st century’,"Two Russian journalists working for a popular pro-Kremlin website filled it with anti-war articles on Monday morning in a rare act of dissent as the country celebrated the Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany. The articles on Lenta.ru called President Vladimir Putin a “pitiful paranoid dictator” and accused him of waging “the bloodiest war of the 21st century”. “We had to do it today. We wanted to remind everyone what our grandfathers really fought for on this beautiful Victory Day – for peace,” said 30-year-old Egor Polyakov, one of the two journalists. During his annual speech in front of 11,000 soldiers in the Kremlin on Monday morning, Putin sought to justify his invasion of Ukraine, tying the current fighting to the Soviet victory in the second world war. “This is not what Victory Day is about,” Polyakov told the Guardian in an interview. “Ordinary people are dying, peaceful women and children are dying in Ukraine. Given the rhetoric that we have seen, this isn’t going to stop. We couldn’t accept this any longer. This was the only right thing we could do.” Polyakov, who works as a business reporter at Lenta, said he and his colleague Alexandra Miroshnikova published more than 40 articles critical of the Kremlin and its actions in Ukraine. The articles have since been taken down, but can be accessed through a web archive tool. Lenta, one of the largest sites in the country with more than 200 million monthly visitors, has been part of the relentless propaganda machine used to justify Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Lenta is owned by Rambler, a media group that was bought in 2020 by Sberbank, Russia’s largest bank, which is state-owned and under US and UK sanctions. Titles on the articles written and published by Polyakov and Miroshnikova on Monday morning included “Vladimir Putin lied about Russia’s plans in Ukraine”, “The Russian army turned out to be an army of thieves and looters” and “Russia abandons the dead bodies of its troops in Ukraine.” Polyakov said each article was sourced from “information available online”, which he said he was usually not allowed to use given the outlet’s “editorial position” and strict censorship rules that in effect criminalise independent reporting. Polyakov and Miroshkina also published a personal letter on the website, which urged readers: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be silent! Fight back! You are not alone, there are many of us! The future is ours!” It is the first major act of protest seen in Russian state media since Marina Ovsyannikova, an editor at Channel One, broke on to the set of the nightly news in mid-March shouting: “Stop the war. No to war.” Pointing to recent laws introduced by Russia aimed at stifling anti-war dissent, Polyakov said he was now “worried” for his safety. Russia has passed a number of laws making the spread of “fake” information about the Russian army an offence punishable with fines or jail terms of up to 15 years. Russian authorities have already charged 46 people under such laws, with 14 of them now behind bars. “Of course I am afraid,” Polyakov said. “I am not ashamed to admit that. But I knew what I was doing, what the consequences could be.” In a separate development, the Rutube video platform was taken down by pro-Ukrainian hackers on Sunday night, while local television menus were hacked, with programme descriptions on smart TVs replaced by a message reading: “The blood of thousands of Ukrainians and hundreds of murdered children is on your hands. TV and the authorities are lying. No to war.” State outlets have frequently been targeted by pro-Ukrainian hackers since the start of the war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘You shake at the smallest of noises’: Russian soldier tells of life as a PoW,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/russian-soldier-pow-ukraine,2022-05-26T04:00:03Z,"Anton, released by Ukraine in a prisoner exchange, says he is only now registering the toll captivity took on mind and body","Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm. “It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian. Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea. Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory. Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians. Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities. One of Anton’s family members further confirmed to the Guardian that he was captured in Ukraine and then exchanged. The Guardian was not able to verify all the details of his story. Anton, who comes from a small, remote city in Siberia, said he signed a contract to join the military last December, shortly after graduating from vocational school. In hindsight, he said, he should “have done everything” to avoid the army. Anton’s unit was first transferred during the last days of December to the Russian-annexed Crimean peninsula, where he was told he was taking part in a “one-week” training course. By that point, he claimed he had received practically no military training that would adequately prepare him for a full-scale war. As weeks went by in Crimea, Anton said some members of his unit started to worry they would be sent to war, a prospect he still considered to be completely “absurd”. “Many of the young guys couldn’t even imagine that we would go to war. They told us at the very last moment about this, the night before the invasion,” he said. “Ultimately, it is really not fair how the Russian authorities treated me. I was sent to Ukraine completely unprepared.” Anton’s account, which depicts a military unit that was kept in the dark about the invasion, echoes a number of other Russian soldiers who have similarly said that they did know they were going to war until they crossed into Ukraine. Military experts have argued that the decision to not tell a large number of its troops about the invasion is one explanation for Moscow’s halting military campaign. On 25 February, the day after Russian troops entered Ukraine, Anton’s unit was ordered to cross into the country from Crimea. He said they were driven in armoured vehicles to the outskirts of Mykolaiv, which was under heavy attack from Russian forces in the early days of the war. As they continued on foot, part of the unit split from the main group and was ambushed by Ukrainian forces on 2 March, less than a week after entering the country. Anton said he was hit by a Ukrainian bullet while being captured, fracturing a bone in his hand. Soon after, Ukrainian forces put a bag on his head as he was transferred to a prison cell, the location of which he said he still does not know. At first, life in captivity was dominated by fear. “You shake at the smallest of noises. Every day you hope that this won’t be your last and you will not be killed,” Anton recalled. He said that he was not physically assaulted during his time in captivity but alleged that Ukrainian guards would mentally torment him and other Russian soldiers. “We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.” Anton added that while some guards looked like “they wanted to hurt you”, the majority remained calm and “would not let their animal instinct set in”. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating prisoner exchanges, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Under the Geneva conventions, the detention of PoWs after capture should not be seen as a form of punishment but as a means to prevent further participation in a conflict. But it was the daily boredom that soon emerged as the biggest challenge, Anton said. “If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television. “Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity. At one point, he was asked to record an interview about his capture with a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. Ukrainian officials have given journalists and vloggers access to interview their Russian PoWs. Such videos have been watched by hundreds of thousands of people on YouTube, but they have also faced criticism for violating the Geneva conventions. “In such a situation, as a prisoner, you understand there isn’t really a choice to say no. You agree despite them saying that you could refuse,” Anton said. Eventually, in early April, Anton was told that he was going to be exchanged for a Ukrainian soldier. While Russia and Ukraine have engaged in several prisoner swaps, both countries have released almost no details on the mechanisms behind the exchanges. On 4 April, Ukraine said that it held about 600 Russian military prisoners of war. Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian PoWs in Russia. That number has since grown significantly after at least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory when the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces last week. Ukraine has said that the Azovstal fighters would be involved in a prisoner swap, but some Russian officials have said they could be tried or even executed. According to Anton, he was part of a one-for-one swap involving 17 other Russian soldiers, which took place near the Ukrainian city of Melitopol. As soon as he was back in Russia, he was intensely questioned by the security services about his time in Ukraine. “They wanted to know if they could still trust me. It was standard procedure,” he said. But it was only days after he was discharged from a Russian hospital that he felt the full toll that his time in captivity had inflicted on his mind and body. “During my captivity, I blocked most of my emotions. I just tried not to think about my life,” he said. “But now, I have terrible dreams, I can barely sleep. I have gained a lot of weight,” he said. Anton said the authorities had given him about £2,000 as compensation for his injuries. According to Russian military law, service people do not receive any special compensation for being held as a PoW, and Anton was expected to return to service once he had recovered from the injuries. But after his experience in Ukraine, Anton is now looking for ways to quit the military for good. “I just want to go back home, man, that is it. All I want is to go home.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russian forces close to encircling Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/27/russian-forces-sievierodonetsk-eastern-ukraine-donbas,2022-05-27T12:15:35Z,"Situation in Donbas ‘even worse than people say it is’, says Ukraine’s foreign minister, as Kremlin makes further gains","The besieged Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk appears to be almost completely surrounded by attacking Russian forces, as the Kremlin continued to make incremental gains in its offensive in the Donbas region, backed by withering shell fire. “The Russians are pounding residential neighbourhoods relentlessly,” regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, wrote in a Telegram post on Friday. “The residents of Sievierodonetsk have forgotten when was the last time there was silence in the city for at least half an hour.” As the cities of Kharkiv to the north and Dnipro to the south also came under attack, analysts said the main Russian effort appeared still to be focused to the east, while Russian attacks elsewhere appeared to be aimed at consolidating their positions and tying down Ukrainian defenders who could otherwise be redeployed. Underlining the state of the fighting in Donbas, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson, who has cast himself as one of Ukraine’s most vocal cheerleaders, said Russia was making slow but “palpable progress”, as the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, accused the Kremlin of carrying out a “genocide” in the country’s east. Ukraine’s foreign minister also offered a bleak assessment. “The military situation in eastern Ukraine is even worse than people say it is and the country needs heavy weapons now to effectively fight Russia,” Dmytro Kuleba said. His comments came as the US and its allies indicated they would provide Ukraine with increasingly sophisticated weapons, including the multiple-launch rocket systems Kyiv for which has been appealing. On Friday, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said in Prague that it was appropriate to support Ukraine with tanks and planes if necessary. Amid the increasingly gloomy news from the campaign in the east, where Ukrainian defenders have been forced to retreat from some positions, Zelenskiy said on Friday that Ukraine was not eager to talk to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, but that it had to face the reality that this would probably be necessary to end the war. “There are things to discuss with the Russian leader. I’m not telling you that to me our people are eager to talk to him, but we have to face the realities of what we are living through,” Zelenskiy said in an address to an Indonesian thinktank. “What do we want from this meeting? … We want our lives back … We want to reclaim the life of a sovereign country within its own territory,” he said, adding that Russia did not appear to be ready yet for serious peace talks. In reply, the Kremlin said on Friday it blamed Ukraine for the fact that peace talks between the two countries were frozen, saying it was unclear what Kyiv wanted. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said in a call with reporters: “The Ukrainian leadership constantly makes contradictory statements. This does not allow us to fully understand what the Ukrainian side wants.” The situation in Sievierodonetsk appeared particularly desperate, with Russian troops reported in some parts of the city. Its mayor said Russian forces were in the Myr hotel on Thursday, on the city’s outskirts, and that 1,500 people had died in the fighting, while between 12,000 and 13,000 were trapped. Russia appeared to have gained full control of the strategic town of Lyman, with the governor of the Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, saying there was heavy fighting around the city after Ukrainian troops withdrew to a new line of defence. Pro-Russia separatists in the Donetsk region said they had “liberated and taken full control of 220 settlements, including Krasny Liman”, using an old name for Lyman. According to some reports, Ukraine has been increasingly forced to plug the gaps among its defenders in Donbas with volunteers, highlighting the increasing stress on its forces in the region. Oleh Synehubov, the regional governor of Kharkiv, which lies to the north of Donbas, said nine civilians had been killed in Russian shelling on Thursday. A five-month-old child and her father were among the dead, while her mother was gravely wounded, he said on social media channels. An Agence France-Presse reporter in the city said the northern residential district of Pavlove Pole was hit and plumes of smoke rose from the area. The journalist saw several people wounded near a shuttered shopping centre, while an elderly man with injuries to his arm and leg was carried away by medics. Commentators believe that Russia’s gains in the three months of war have been far more paltry than Putin originally hoped for, although Moscow has gained control over a handful of cities in southern Ukraine, such as Kherson and Mariupol. That has been cited as the explanation for the intensity of the Russian effort to take the entirety of Donbas, in what could be painted as a major victory for Putin. The Kremlin is seeking to tighten its grip over the parts of Ukraine it occupies, including fast-tracking citizenship for residents of areas under Russian control. The occupying authorities in Mariupol, which was taken over by invading forces this month after a devastating siege that left thousands dead and reduced the city to rubble, have cancelled school holidays to prepare students to switch to a Russian curriculum, according to Kyiv. Whether Russian forces can advance beyond Donbas and the areas in the south they control is more questionable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia may scrap age limits for soldiers to bolster Ukraine invasion force,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/russia-may-scrap-age-limits-for-soldiers-to-bolster-ukraine-invasion-force,2022-05-20T15:48:21Z,Legislation would allow recruitment of older professionals as military faces infantry shortage,"Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Two members of the ruling United Russia party who introduced the law said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. “For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45,” it said. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. The lawmakers added that the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Russia initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces – 150,000 men – into the war in February, according to western officials. In the 82 days since, it has “suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed,” British military intelligence claimed last week. The Russian military has also faced issues of low morale among its troops, as reports have emerged that hundreds of troops are unwilling to fight in what Russia calls its “special military operation”. “Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted – they won’t be able to keep this up for a long period,” said Rob Lee, a military analyst. Despite widespread speculation and warnings by western intelligence, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has so far opted against ordering a large-scale military draft and formally declaring war on Ukraine, possibly fearing the repercussions such measures would have at home. Instead, the Russian authorities have quietly stepped up their efforts to recruit new contract soldiers. An investigation by the BBC’s Russian service showed that Russia’s defence ministry filled employment websites with vacancies, offering people with no combat experience opportunities to join the army on lucrative short-term contracts. Some large government-run companies have received letters urging them to sign up their staff for the army. The Guardian has also previously reported on how authorities in the pro-Russian Donbas region have organised an aggressive mobilisation campaign, forcing many men to go into hiding to avoid being sent to the frontline. Separately on Friday, Putin posthumously awarded the former rebel warlord Arseny Pavlov, also known as “Motorola”, with the Order of Courage. Motorola, a former veteran of the second Chechen war, was one of the first Russians who crossed into Ukraine to join the pro-Russian rebel movement in 2014, where he led the Sparta battalion, known as one of the more ruthless and ill-disciplined of the militia formations. Motorola has previously boasted of killing 15 Ukrainian soldiers. He died in murky circumstances in 2016 from a powerful bomb apparently planted in his apartment block’s lift. Russia has always denied its role in the Donbas, where war has been raging since 2014, despite evidence collected by journalists and NGO’s that Russia’s military was deployed in the region.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Denmark votes overwhelmingly to join EU’s common defence policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/denmark-votes-on-joining-eus-common-defence-policy,2022-06-01T22:14:02Z,Government’s proposal to ditch opt-out backed by 66.9% to 33.1% in referendum following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe’s security landscape. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining the common security and defence policy (CSDP) and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack. “Tonight Denmark has sent a very important signal. To our allies in Europe and Nato, and to Putin,” she told cheering supporters on Wednesday evening after the result was published. “We’re showing that when Putin invades a free country and threatens stability in Europe, we others pull together. “Denmark now can partake in the European cooperation on defence and security. And for that I’m very, very happy.” Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, and pledged to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. “Nato will of course remain our most important tool, but the EU gives us another in securing our defence in the east,” the ruling Social Democrats’ defence spokesperson, Mogens Jensen, said. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament, had urged voters to drop the opt-out. “The world is changing, and not in a good way. We need to stand together and strengthen the cooperation that strengthens our security,” said Jakob Ellemann-Jensen, head of the opposition Liberal party. Participation in the EU’s defence policy will allow Denmark, a founding Nato member, to take part in joint EU military operations, such as those in Bosnia, Mali and Somalia, and will allow Danish officials to stay in the room when EU colleagues discuss defence issues. EU leaders Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel welcomed the result. Denmark’s decision was a “strong message of commitment to our common security”, Von der Leyen tweeted, saying Denmark and the European Union would benefit. “This decision will benefit Europe and make both the EU and the Danish people safer and stronger,” Michel wrote on Twitter. It would be seen largely as a symbolic win in Brussels, experts said. “The political significance will outweigh the military contribution,” said Kristian Soby Kristensen, a senior researcher at Copenhagen University’s Centre for Military Studies. Those opposed to abandoning the opt-out argued that the EU’s defence cooperation is hampered by excessive bureaucracy and inefficient decision-making, and that a joint European defence would come at the expense of Nato.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Putin involved in war ‘at level of colonel or brigadier’, say western sources",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/putin-involved-russia-ukraine-war-western-sources,2022-05-16T20:00:38Z,"President helping determine movement of Russian soldiers, say sources, as head of UK armed forces says Ukraine is winning","Vladimir Putin has become so personally involved in the Ukraine war that he is making operational and tactical decisions “at the level of a colonel or brigadier”, according to western military sources. The Russian president is helping determine the movement of forces in the Donbas, they added, where last week the invaders suffered a bloody defeat as they tried on multiple occasions to cross a strategic river in the east of Ukraine. The sources added that Putin is still working closely with Gen Valery Gerasimov, the commander of the Russian armed forces, in contrast to claims made by Ukraine last week that the military chief had been sidelined. “We think Putin and Gerasimov are involved in tactical decision making at a level we would normally expect to be taken by a colonel or a brigadier,” the military source said, referring to the ongoing battle in the east of Ukraine. Moscow’s armies have so far failed to achieve a breakthrough in the Donbas, where they have been mounting an offensive for a month that has failed several times to encircle the smaller Ukrainian forces. No further detail to back up the statement was provided, although it was implied the assessment about Putin’s close personal involvement was based on intelligence that had been received. Colonels in the US army and brigadiers in the British army typically command a brigade, units made up of a handful of battalions – the latter of which is equivalent to the smallest operating unit in the Russian army. Russia’s military operates in a more top down fashion compared to western counterparts, with instructions typically sent to generals in the field. But Moscow’s faltering invasion has meant that it has been forced to send generals closer to the frontline, where up to 12 have been killed, according to the Ukrainian armed forces. Ben Barry, a former brigadier in the British army, and a land warfare expert at the International Institute of Strategic Studies, said: “A head of government should have better things to do than make military decisions. They should be setting the political strategy rather than getting bogged down in day to day activity”. Last week’s failed attempt to cross the Siverskyi Donets river at Bilohorivka led to the destruction of more than 70 Russian vehicles, and the loss of at least one batallion’s worth of equipment, according to estimates based on aerial photography of the battle site. The defeat was so serious it led some Russian military bloggers to comment “on the incompetence of the Russian military to their hundreds of thousands of followers”, according to the Institute for the Study of War, a rare sign of internal dissent. In the past 24 hours, Russian forces shelled frontline positions in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas area as fighting becomes increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces after more than 11 weeks of war. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region, said on Monday that Russian strikes had hit a hospital in the city over the weekend, killing two and injuring nine, including a child – and several other locations had been targeted. Ukrainian forces repelled 17 attacks on Sunday, he added, and destroyed 11 Russian armoured vehicles. The Russians are gradually mounting an assault on Severodonetsk, an industrial city that had a population of 100,000 before the war, as the effort to complete a wider encirclement of Ukraine’s defending forces in the Donbas appears to have failed. Ukrainian forces also continued to push Russian forces back from Kharkiv, the country’s second biggest city, with Volodomyr Zelenskiy congratulating soldiers who erected a new border post on Russia’s border north of the city. “I’m very grateful to you, on behalf of all Ukrainians, on my behalf and on behalf of my family,” he said in a video message. “I’m very grateful to all the fighters like you.” Russia’s withdrawal is a fighting retreat, however, with the outlying northern villages around Kharkiv being peppered with shelling on Monday, with one person confirmed killed in Tsyrkuny, 17 miles from the city centre and four injured in the districts of Shevchenkivskyi and Saltivka. Ukrainian officials said that Russian forces were concentrating on “maintaining positions and preventing the advance of our troops toward the border”. Britain’s chief of defence staff, Adm Sir Tony Radakin, said he believed that Ukraine was now winning the war because Putin had wanted to “subjugate the whole of Ukraine” and “impose his own rule on that country” and had failed. Giving a speech in to a parliamentary audience in Westminster, the head of the UK armed forces said Ukraine was winning because it had fought off “an existential threat” and that “its nation is going to survive,” he added. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed “Russian forces have likely abandoned the objective of completing a large-scale encirclement of Ukrainian units from Donetsk City to Izium” in favour of capturing the remainder of the Luhansk region, of which Severodonetsk is part. A second smaller-scale encirclement of Severodonetsk also failed last week after Russian forces were defeated with heavy losses in a series of unsuccessful attempts to cross the Siverskyi Donets River at Bilohorivka. The river is increasingly becoming a dividing line between the two sides in the Donbas – the name given collectively to the Donetsk and Luhansk regions – and around Kharkiv to the north. Haidai said battles were taking place on Sunday to the north and south of Severodonetsk, which is one of the few locations held by Ukraine on the east side of the river. Analysts believe there may be a long struggle for the city. Konrad Muzyka, the founder of Rochan Consulting, which specialises in open source intelligence, said he believed the capture of Severodonetsk was weeks away. “Moscow … does not have the appropriate manpower and equipment levels to take the city swiftly,” he said in a weekly review of the fighting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Fighting focuses on Donbas, but Putin has not given up on Kharkiv – or Kyiv",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/29/ukraine-donbas-donetsk-luhansk-fighting-putin-kharkiv-kyiv,2022-05-29T07:00:01Z,The outcome of Russia’s attacks on the Donetsk and Luhansk areas will determine the fate of the rest of Ukraine,"After three months of full-scale war against Ukraine, in which ground troops invaded from several directions and missiles hit targets across the country, right up to the western border with Poland, the focus of the current phase of the conflict is back on the region where Russia has been fighting Ukraine for the past eight years: Donbas. Military analyst Michael Kofman wrote on Twitter last week: “The overall military balance in this war still trends in Ukraine’s favour, given manpower availability and access to extensive Western military support … But the local balance in the Donbas during this phase is a different story.” How fully and how quickly Vladimir Putin attains his objectives in Donbas may dictate how and whether other parts of Ukraine come back into play. The level of losses sustained will also play a role. Donbas Russia has abandoned attempts to encircle all Ukrainian forces in Donbas for the more modest goal of creating “cauldrons” – smaller encirclements cutting Ukrainians off from supplies and reinforcements. Last week, the focus was on the city of Sievierodonetsk, where local governor Serhiy Haidai said Russia had committed 10,000 soldiers and an extra 2,500 pieces of equipment to attacking the city. There are reports that the Russians already control a hotel on the outskirts of the city, after many days of ruthless bombardments. If Russia takes Sievierodonetsk, it will control the entire Luhansk region, and can increase its focus on parts of Donetsk it still does not control. “I don’t think the Russian offensive looks stalled, and while sluggish, there is no good way to predict when it will culminate,” wrote Kofman. Occupied territories There is no longer any doubt that Russia plans to fully annex parts of Ukraine, as it did with Crimea in 2014. Then, Moscow declined to do the same with the areas it controlled in east Ukraine, preferring instead to prop up separatist administrations there. Now, there is talk of rapid annexation of the parts of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia provinces that Russia took in the first days of the invasion. Unlike Mariupol, which Russia conquered after bombing it to rubble – and possibly other cities in Donbas that Russia may soon capture – these territories were largely taken with no fighting, so Russia has been able to focus on mopping up dissent and trying to take full control. The areas have seen an increased crackdown on pro-Ukrainian sentiment, as well as reports that Russia is introducing the rouble and Moscow time zone, announcements that teachers will be retrained in the Russian curriculum, and a series of sinister videos of locals announcing on camera that they had been through “a course of denazification” and no longer support Ukraine. Formal annexation of this territory could have huge consequences for the prospect of a peace deal. Ukraine will not accept the loss of these areas, but if it launches a counterattack, Russia could claim Ukraine was attacking Russian territory. Kyiv Life in the Ukrainian capital feels more normal by the week. The occasional air raid siren and men with guns on the streets are reminders of the war, but cafe terraces are busy, the opera has reopened and the curfew has been pushed back to 11pm. Since the Russians withdrew at the beginning of April, there has been no artillery threat, and no repeat of the booms from the suburbs that characterised the first weeks of the war. However, Russian-language news outlet Meduza last week quoted Kremlin-linked sources claiming that Putin had not yet given up on Kyiv and may launch another assault once the battle for Donbas is over. Kharkiv As with Kyiv, the Russians attempted to storm the country’s second city in the early days of the war and, as in the capital, they faced unexpectedly strong resistance, were stalled on the outskirts and then pushed back into positions surrounding the city. In recent weeks, Ukrainian forces have pushed the Russians back further but, unlike with Kyiv, the invaders are still within striking distance of the city. Last Thursday, areas within the city limits were shelled for the first time in two weeks and nine civilians died, according to local authorities. Military commanders say there is no sign of a new advance on Kharkiv, but the Russians are digging firmly into the positions they still hold, with no plans to retreat all the way to the border as they did elsewhere. “They are planning something,” said one commander based outside the city last week. “We may only find out what it is when it happens.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Snake Island does job of Moskva as Russia maintains grip on Black Sea,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/snake-island-does-job-of-moskva-as-russia-maintains-grip-on-black-sea,2022-05-24T18:54:41Z,Russia determined to hang on to its ‘unsinkable destroyer’ as Ukraine tries to win vital landmass back,"Fished out of the water, smashed asunder, is a Ukrainian TB2 drone, retrieved in the last couple of days off the coast of Romania and almost certainly a legacy of a bold attempt to retake Snake Island earlier in the month. The previously inconsequential low-lying 17-hectare (42-acre) rock, nearly 30 miles from the coasts of Ukraine and Romania, has become of growing strategic importance as Russia seeks to maintain its blockade of Ukraine’s remaining coastline. For all the videos of TB2 drones destroying Russian air defence systems, helicopters and landing craft this month, Ukraine has failed in its attempt to retake the island, memorably lost in the first days of the war when its garrison told the attacking Russian warship to “go fuck yourself”. Over the weekend a Togolese-flagged vessel passing near Snake Island was warned by the Russians to “leave the territorial waters of Russia, otherwise weapons will be used”, according to the Ukrainian navy. It amounted to “illegally appropriating Ukrainian territory”, the navy added. Russia’s navy has dominated the Black Sea since the war began, not least because Ukraine had no real maritime force to speak of. It had lost three-quarters or more of its navy during Russia’s seizure of Crimea in 2014 and its only remaining frigate was deliberately scuttled days after the war started to prevent its capture. However, Russia lost its flagship missile cruiser, the Moskva, in the middle of April to a Neptune cruise missile strike from Ukraine’s mainland. The ship had provided air and sea defence capability to the remainder of Russia’s Black Sea fleet, consisting of 20 or more warships and submarines. The Moskva had helped capture Snake Island, and without it the Russian fleet was pushed back further from Ukraine’s coast (Neptune missiles have a range of up to 200 miles), bringing the island back into play. Russia’s determination to hang on to the rock shows it is, in effect, an alternative to the sunken ship. “Think of it as an unsinkable destroyer,” said Andy Netherwood, an air defence expert. “If you place a radar and surface-to-air missile systems there, it allows you to dominate the airspace in the northern Black Sea, including the strategically important approach to Odesa.” Russia has used its dominance of the Black Sea to launch Kalibr cruise missile attacks on Ukrainian targets, including from submarines. The missiles can have a range of 1,200 miles, able in theory to strike virtually anywhere in Ukraine. But if anything it is the economic aspect that has come to the fore. “In a conflict of attrition and erosion, the ability to maintain an economic blockade can become significant. World war one comes to mind,” said Dr Sidharth Kaushal, a naval power expert with the Rusi thinktank, referring to the long British naval blockade of Germany that is widely believed to have helped bring about the Central powers’ eventual collapse towards the end of 1918. Ukraine, however, is a net exporter of food, particularly grain and sunflower oil. It previously moved 70% of its exports by sea, including 99% of its grain deliveries to countries including Egypt, Ethiopia, Lebanon and Yemen. Although some grain is now moving by land, it will not be enough. Discussions have turned to the idea of creating a protective naval convoy for merchant shipping bound for Ukraine, as proposed by Lithuania this week. But while the UK and others are sympathetic, it would require broad international support, including, Royal Navy sources suggested on Tuesday, from China. It would also require the involvement of Turkey, which closed the straits to all warships – except those returning to their home port – at the end of February, a situation welcomed by Ukraine at the time because it prevented more Russian warships from entering the Black Sea. Opening the straits would allow limited access for Nato warships, for up to 21 days at a time under the 1936 Montreux convention, but also for Russia – meaning any convoy solution may have to be agreed with Moscow. It would also require a de-mining of the Ukrainian coast, somewhat hastily defended when the war broke out. Amid such complications, attention remains focused on military solutions. Lloyd Austin, the US defence secretary, said on Monday that Denmark would send to Ukraine a Harpoon cruise missile system, with a similar operational range to the Neptune – the first declared deployment of such a naval system. That will help keep the Russian warships away from Ukraine’s coast, although Moscow’s Kilo-class submarines remain able to roam far more freely. Despite the attempts to take back Snake Island and the growing international calls to reopen the Black Sea, Russia’s grip on the strategic body of water remains firm. • This article was amended on 25 May 2022.

Ukraine forces prepare for possible attack on Belarusian border,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/ukraine-forces-prepare-for-possible-attack-on-belarusian-border,2022-05-22T06:00:41Z,Unit of young and old volunteer fighters guard network of trenches built since February invasion,"Ukrainian forces have built a new line of defences along the country’s previously unfortified northern border with Belarus amid signs of another attack. Russian forces invaded Ukraine through the Belarusian border in February when they tried to capture the capital, Kyiv. On 10 May, Belarus’s army chief, Viktor Gulevich, announced the deployment of Belarusian special forces and equipment in response to what he described as a “southern threat” from Ukraine and Nato. Belarus has been conducting military drills on its border with Ukraine since early May. The Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko, has been Russia’s closest ally in its war in Ukraine. On Tuesday, Lukashenko urged the Russian-led military alliance, the Collective Security Treaty Organisation, which met in Moscow, to remain united on Ukraine and accused the west of prolonging the conflict. The Guardian was given access to Ukraine’s border positions on the condition that it did not disclose the exact locations or the surnames of the Ukrainians serving. In the forests along the Belarusian border, a Ukrainian territorial defence unit made up of fighters between the ages of 19 and the mid-60s, is manning a network of trenches and positions constructed since the February invasion. Before February, much of Ukraine’s border with Belarus consisted of small kiosk-like checkpoints which Russian tanks broke through with ease. Two days after the invasion, Ukraine closed all its border crossings with Belarus and Russia. In their analysis of the threat from Belarus, the UK’s Ministry of Defence said last week that the presence of Belarusian forces on the border would probably prevent Ukraine from deploying support operations on its Donbas front. Armed with AK47s and a few dozen men per position, the fighters hope the Belarusian border will not be used by invading forces again. “We’ll be in the frying pan,” joked Vova, a man who volunteered to fight in the Donbas in 2014 and was in the Soviet army. Vova signed up to fight alongside his brother, Ihor, and his brother’s son, Maksym, on the second day of the war. “They took the first 500 men in the queue that day, but there were over 800 of us,” said Ihor, sat between his brother and son at the makeshift barracks near the border. “I’ve got hypertension, he’s got hypertension, he’s on insulin,” said Ihor, pointing around the room at the middle-aged and pension-aged men. “And then the other part of the unit is younger guys like Maksym.” Ihor and Maksym were working on a construction site in Kyiv on the morning of the invasion. They rushed back to the Zhytomyr region, where their family live, to sign up. Territorial defence units in Ukraine are made up of people who fight in the same region as where they live. The men and a few women in the unit said some of them knew each other from before the war. In almost every other case, there is only a few degrees of separation. “In some cases, it was like, ‘Oh, your grandmother knows my grandfather, maybe we’re brothers’,” said Ihor, who added that fighting among people from his own region gave him a great sense of duty and motivation.

The miles-long narrow roads that lead down from the border are surrounded by thick forests which cover the deep, swampy ground. “No one has ever managed to hold this territory for that reason,” said Ihor, the unit’s military press secretary, speaking about battles around the northern border during the second world war.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why are Sweden and Finland not yet in Nato and does the alliance want them?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/12/why-are-sweden-and-finland-not-yet-in-nato-and-does-the-alliance-want-them,2022-05-12T11:54:44Z,Analysis: the two countries are considering applying to join after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine,"Finland and Sweden could apply for membership of the 30-nation Nato alliance within days, ending decades of military non-alignment in a historic shift triggered by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here is a brief look at the background and implications of their decisions. What is Nato? The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation is a defensive military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries including the US, UK and France to counter the threat of postwar Soviet Russian expansion in Europe. Its common security guarantee is based on article 5 of the treaty, which states that an attack on one member is an attack on all and commits members to defend each other in the event of armed aggression. Why are Finland and Sweden not already members? Both considered that joining the alliance would represent an unnecessary provocation of Moscow, and so have long pursued policies of neutrality, and then non-alignment, to avoid antagonising a major regional power. Finland’s concerns have been largely practical: it shares an 810-mile (1,300km) border with Russia, declared independence in 1917 after more than a century of rule by Moscow, and its army twice fought off Soviet forces during the second world war before ceding about 10% of its territory. A 1948 agreement of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance with Russia isolated Finland militarily from western Europe, though the breakup of the Soviet Union and EU membership have since allowed it to step out of Russia’s shadow. Sweden’s opposition to Nato membership has been more ideological. Its postwar foreign policy has focused on multilateral dialogue and nuclear disarmament and it has long seen itself as a mediator on the international stage, running down its military after the end of the cold war. It has reintroduced conscription and boosted defence spending since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, but many on the Swedish left remain suspicious of the US-led Nato’s agenda and argue that Nato membership will only increase regional tensions. Why are they considering joining now? Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, and her Swedish counterpart, Magdalena Andersson, said last month that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine had “changed Europe’s whole security landscape” and “dramatically shaped mindsets” in the Nordic region. Essentially, many Finns and Swedes increasingly feel that joining Nato will help keep them safe when they face a plainly belligerent and unpredictable Russian leader. Polls show public support for Nato membership has trebled to about 75% in Finland and surged to about 60% in Sweden. Nato membership would mean that for the first time Finland and Sweden would have security guarantees from nuclear states. Would Nato welcome them? Both countries switched from formal neutrality to military non-alignment in 1995 when they joined the EU. They are already Nato partners, taking part in exercises and exchanging intelligence with the alliance. Finland already meets Nato’s defence spending target of 2% of GDP, while Sweden is on course to do so. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, has said they would be welcomed “with open arms” if they do apply and that the accession process would be quick, although formal ratification by all the alliance’s members could take several months. From the military perspective, the addition of Finland’s and Sweden’s armed forces would represent a major boost to Nato’s assets in northern Europe, filling a hole in the alliance’s defences by doubling the length of its border with Russia and improving security and stability in the Baltic region. What does Russia have to say? Russia has repeatedly warned Finland and Sweden against joining Nato, saying the “serious military and political consequences” of such a move would oblige it to take “retaliatory steps” to “restore military balance” by strengthening its defences in the Baltic, including by deploying nuclear weapons. Vladimir Putin sees Nato not as a defensive alliance but as a threat to Russia’s security. He blames Nato for blocking his takeover of Ukraine and has demanded Nato troops be withdrawn from eastern Europe. It is unclear how he would respond if he considers the alliance’s expansion in northern Europe an existential danger. What happens next? Finland’s president, prime minister and senior cabinet ministers will meet on Sunday to make a formal decision on submitting an application. A positive decision would then be presented to parliament for approval early next week. Sweden’s ruling Social Democrats have been split on the issue and are holding an internal consultation, with a decision also due on Sunday. The party is widely expected to back membership, giving an overwhelming majority of MPs in favour. Swedish media have said a final government decision will be made on Monday, with a formal application for membership to be submitted shortly afterwards. Many analysts believe the two countries will apply simultaneously.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Nato ‘doing literally nothing’ to stop Russia, says Kyiv – as it happened ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/25/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russians-trying-to-destroy-donbas-says-zelenskiy-as-fighting-intensifies-live,2022-05-26T00:18:29Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Nato of “doing literally nothing” in the face of Russia’s invasion of his country. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kuleba praised the EU for its “revolutionary” decisions to back Kyiv but said the Nato military alliance had been “completely sidelined”. Ukraine has again pleaded for more weapons, including multiple launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower. “We need the help of our partners - above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” president Zelenskiy said in his national address. Kuleba added his country “badly” needs multiple launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower. Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. “Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace,” he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych added: “No one is going to trade a gram of our sovereignty or a millimetre of our territory. Our children are dying, soldiers are being blown apart by shells, and they tell us to sacrifice territory. Get lost. It’s never going to happen.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s plan to simplify the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied regions violates international law. The ministry’s statement came after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree simplifying the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia region. Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Police in Lysychansk are collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Some 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added, Reuters reports. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.” A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.” Here are some of the latest images to come out Ukraine today. Zelenskiy has rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. Symptomatic editorials began to appear in some Western media stating that Ukraine must allegedly accept so-called difficult compromises by giving up territory in exchange for peace,” he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Zelenskiy said pressure from those “stuck” in previous centuries are living in a time “when the interests of nations were indeed often traded for attempts to appease the appetites of dictators”. Earlier in the day, in an expletive-filled tirade, presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych said some European nations clearly wanted Ukraine to make concessions to Putin. No one is going to trade a gram of our sovereignty or a millimetre of our territory,” he said in video remarks posted online. Our children are dying, soldiers are being blown apart by shells, and they tell us to sacrifice territory. Get lost. It’s never going to happen.” Ukraine continues to plead for more weapons, including multiple launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower. “We need the help of our partners - above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” president Zelensky said in his daily address to the nation. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba added his country “badly” needs multiple launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower. Russia overwhelms Ukraine in a number of heavy weapons, but the biggest imbalance is with MLRS, mobile batteries of long-range rockets, he said. Kuleba said he had come to Davos at a “very difficult moment on the frontline” as fighting rages in the eastern Donbas region. “The battle for Donbas is very much like the battles of the Second World War,” he told journalists. “Some villages and towns, they do not exist anymore,” he said. “They were all turned into rubble by Russian artillery fire, by Russian multiple launch rocket systems. It’s devastating.” Zelensky also told a traditional ‘Ukraine Breakfast’ event on the sidelines of the WEF: “Unity is about weapons. My question is, is there this unity in practice? I can’t see it. Our huge advantage over Russia would be when we are truly united.” Here is a particularly poignant quote made by Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas during a speech in Stockholm earlier today, warning against making any concessions for Russia. It is much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him. All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.” “I warned about premature calls for a ceasefire and peace. We cannot give anything to the aggressor that it didn’t have before – or the aggression will sooner or later return. No sign Russia has changed its calculus. I don’t believe in goodwill by an outright aggressor and a cold-blooded war criminal. We must avoid a bad peace. A badly negotiated peace for Ukraine would mean a bad peace for us all.” Drone footage has illustrated the damage of a missile attack on a train facility in Pokrovsk, in the Donetsk region. Taken on Wednesday, the video shows the aftermath of the strike, which wrecked buildings and infrastructure. It comes as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have increased their assault on two key towns in the Donbas region.

Her remarks came as Finnish and Swedish delegations began talks with Ankara today, which Andersson said would provide an opportunity to clear up what she said was “confusion” circulating about Swedish support for different groups. The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops, Reuters reports. In a video address, Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy, commenting on the new Russian enlistment rules, said: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight. It will still take time to crush this will.” Police in Lysychansk are collecting bodies of people killed in order to bury them in mass graves, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said. Some 150 people have been buried in a mass grave in one Lysychansk district, he added, Reuters reports. Oleksiy Arestovych, an adviser to Ukraine’s president, said Russia’s “army is having some tactical success which is threatening to become an operational success in the direction of Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk”. An increasing number of former global leaders are pushing for an International Anti-Corruption Court, a decade-old idea that has resurfaced more recently in response to the invasion. A declaration signed by 42 former prime ministers and presidents from around the world and more than 250 figures from 75 countries, signified mounting anger over financial sources of the conflict, the Washington Post reports: “Corruption among public officials isn’t just a financial problem; it also undermines democracy and the rule of law in a country and exacerbates inequality among its people,” Dutch minister of foreign affairs Wopke Hoekstra said at a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in April. But Hoekstra also emphasized that the Netherlands, which houses the International Criminal Court in The Hague, could only establish an anti-corruption court with the support of many other nations – a level of support that is far from assured.” American leaders have not signed on, and the US is considered a hotbed of international corruption. It is now nearly midnight in Kyiv. I am Gabrielle Canon, here to take you through the latest updates. Prince Charles spent time in Romania at a Ukrainian refugee center, BBC reports, visiting civilians who have fled the violence. The visit in Bucharest is the first from a senior royal in the region. Romania has welcomed nearly a million Ukrainians, and tens of thousands continue to cross into the country. Roughly 6 million people have left Ukraine since the start of the invasion. Prince Charles, who has been vocal about the war calling it a “brutal aggression,” met with families at the center that also provided resources for refugees as they navigate through transitions into a new country. A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertilizer exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported. Since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine on 24 February, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of western sanctions imposed on Russia over the war have disrupted its fertilizer and grain exports. The conflict is fueling a global food crisis with prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertilizer soaring. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies, while Russia is also a key global fertilizer exporter and Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil. Nebenzia said: Formally, fertilizers and grain are not under sanctions, but there are logistical, transport, insurance, bank transfer problems [created by western sanctions that] prevent us from exporting freely. “We are prepared to export fertilizers and grain from our ports to the world market ... I think that should be negotiated with the Ukrainians, not with Russians.” However, western officials say any deal on access to Ukrainian ports would need Russian agreement, citing what they say is a Russian blockade and a need for security guarantees. UN secretary-general António Guterres, who visited Moscow and Kyiv last month, is in “intense contact” with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the United States and the European Union in a bid to broker what he calls a “package deal” to resume both Ukrainian food exports and Russian food and fertilizer exports. Nebenzia said that top UN trade and development official Rebecca Grynspan was due to discuss Russian exports during a visit to Moscow in the coming days. She is coordinator of the UN Global Crisis Response Group on Food, Energy and Finance that aims to combat global economic shocks from the Ukraine war. Nebenzia also said he believed UN aid chief Martin Griffiths was due to visit Moscow sometime in early June. UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric declined to comment. Russian forces are advancing in the Luhansk part of the Donbas and it’s grim for many places in that province. Fighting has reached the ‘outskirts’ of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk, AKA Sievierodonetsk, in the region, which had a pre-war population of 100,000, according to AFP. Here are some of the latest news images coming out of a funeral held in Kyiv after Ukrainian troops were lost in the Donbas. The Ukrainian flag on a casket. The Associated Press and the PBS series “Frontline” have independently verified that Russia has destroyed or damaged at least 56 Ukrainian schools in a manner that indicates a possible war crime, the Associated Press reports. The Ukrainian government says Russia has shelled more than 1,000 schools, destroying 95. The accounting likely represents just a fraction of potential war crimes committed during the conflict and the list is updated daily. A geography teacher, Elena Kudrik, lay dead on the floor of School 50 in the eastern Ukrainian town of Gorlovka. Amid the wreckage surrounding her were books and papers, smeared in blood. In the corner, another lifeless body of Elena Ivanova, the assistant headmaster slumped over in an office chair, a gaping wound torn into her side. “It’s a tragedy for us ... It’s a tragedy for the children,” said school director Sergey But, standing outside the brick building shortly after the attack. A few kilometers away, at the Sonechko pre-school in the city of Okhtyrka, a cluster bomb destroyed a kindergarten, killing a child. Outside the entrance, two more bodies lay in pools of blood. Despite the widespread damage and destruction to educational infrastructure, war crimes experts say proving an attacking military’s intent to target individual schools is difficult. Russian officials deny targeting civilian structures, and local media reports in Russian-held Gorlovka alleged Ukrainian forces trying to recapture the area were to blame for the blast that killed the two teachers there. But the effects of the destruction are indisputable. Unicef communications director Toby Fricker, who is currently in Ukraine, agreed. “School is often the heart of the community in many places, and that is so central to everyday life.” As the war grinds on, millions of kids are continuing to go to school online. The international aid group Save the Children said it is working with the government to establish remote learning programs for students at 50 schools. Unicef is also trying to help with online instruction. “Educating every child is essential to preventing grave violations of their rights,” the group said in a statement to the AP. Turkey threatens to stall Nato process if Nordic nations fail to act. Turkey on Wednesday said the Nato accession process for Sweden and Finland would not move forward unless they addressed Ankara’s security concerns, in talks with delegations from both Nordic states, Agence France-Presse writes. We conveyed our message in very clear terms that the process will not move forward unless Turkey’s security concerns are addressed through concrete steps and within a certain timetable,” presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin told reporters after meeting Swedish and Finnish representatives in the capital Ankara. Nato member Turkey has opposed the applications of Sweden and neighbouring Finland over what it considers leniency toward Kurdish militant groups. Stockholm and Helsinki submitted their bids to join the US-led defense alliance last week, reversing decades of military non-alignment, after political and public support for membership soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. But Turkey is throwing a spanner in the works as any membership must be unanimously approved by all Nato members. Ankara accuses Stockholm in particular of providing safe haven for the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK), listed as a terror group by Turkey and its western allies. They told us they understand Turkey’s security concerns, but we’ll see what steps they will take,” Kalin said, adding that dialogue would continue. Sweden has imposed embargoes on arms sales to Turkey since 2019 over Ankara’s military offensive in Syria. Kalin said on Wednesday he was seeing a “positive” attitude on the removal of sanctions in the defense industry. We don’t think it is appropriate for allies to impose sanctions on each other, that would weaken the alliance and make enemies happy,” he added. It is 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Nato of “doing literally nothing” in the face of Russia’s invasion of his country. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kuleba praised the EU for its “revolutionary” decisions to back Kyiv but said the Nato military alliance had been “completely sidelined”.

It comes as Ukrainian officials said Russian forces have increased their assault on two key towns in the Donbas region. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, accused Nato of “doing literally nothing” in the face of Russia’s invasion of his country. Kuleba praised the EU for its “revolutionary” decisions to back Kyiv but said the Nato military alliance had been “completely sidelined”. Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Kuleba said: Nato as an alliance, as an institution, is completely sidelined and doing literally nothing. I’m sorry to say it. He said that at the beginning of Russia’s war in Ukraine, “there was a public sentiment that Nato was the strong force and the EU was only capable of expressing various different levels of concern”, adding: But war is always a test that takes the masks off. Kuleba praised Brussels for its “revolutionary, groundbreaking decisions, which even they themselves did not expect to make”, and accepted that some Nato allies “are helping us”. He also dismissed Moscow’s claim that it was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for ships carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. He told the audience at Davos: You could not find a better example of a blackmail in international relations. If anyone is buying it, I think there is a problem with that person, and we shouldn’t waste too much time trying to understand why that person is making that point. Germany’s chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said victory for Ukraine “does not seem to be an option” and that Berlin is “waiting for Putin to say his war goals are reached”. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has been pictured meeting soldiers wounded during the conflict in Ukraine. Wearing a white medical coat, Putin spoke with soldiers at Moscow’s Mandryka military hospital in the first such visit since he sent troops into Ukraine. After meeting the wounded men, Putin said at a televised meeting with government officials: These are people who are risking their health and lives for the sake of the people and children of Donbas, for the sake of Russia. They are all heroes. Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s plan to simplify the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied regions violates international law. The ministry said the initiative to make it easier for Ukrainians living in the southern Ukrainian regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson to receive Russian citizenship was further evidence of the Kremlin’s “criminal” war goals. In a statement, it said: The illegal issuing of passports … is a flagrant violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as norms and principles of international humanitarian law. Here’s a quick recap of the key events from today: Sergiy Gaidai, governor of the eastern region of Lugansk, said Sievierodonetsk was being hammered by air strikes, rockets, artillery and mortars. Russian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine and attacking key cities, particularly the industrial city of Sievierodonetsk in a bid to solidify control over the province and move further into Ukraine. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree simplifying the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze said the decree “turns occupation into annexation” and accused Russian forces of “first destroying, then stealing our territories and people”. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine.

Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. A Russian-backed official in the occupied Ukrainian port of Mariupol said the first ship to leave since Russian forces captured the city would leave in the next few days. The official said the ship would take about 3,000 tonnes of metals to Rostov-on-Don in Russia, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. It has not been possible to verify this information. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.” Sweden is “obviously” not funding or arming terrorist organisations, its prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a hotbed for terrorist groups.

Hello everyone, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong still with you to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. A Russian-backed official in the occupied Ukrainian port of Mariupol said the first ship to leave since Russian forces captured the city would leave in the next few days. The official said the ship would take about 3,000 tonnes of metals to Rostov-on-Don in Russia, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Earlier, Russia’s defence ministry said that Mariupol’s port was “operating normally”. It has not been possible to verify this information. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. They say five are Russian soldiers, one is a Russian mercenary with the Wagner Group and the final two are Belarusian mercenaries. The Guardian has previously reported on the alleged involvement of the soldiers named by prosecutors on Tuesday regarding the systematic torture and murder of civilians in Ukraine including the head of Motyzhyn council, her husband and son. There have been reports of Wagner fighters on the ground in Ukraine, but these are the first charges against allegedly serving mercenaries, and the first non-Russians charged. Established in 2014 to support pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine, Wagner is allegedly funded by Yevgeny Prigozhin, a powerful businessman who is closely linked to Vladimir Putin and has faced western sanctions. Russia has used paid fighters to bolster its forces since the start of the war. It was estimated to have deployed between 10,000 and 20,000 mercenaries from Syria, Libya and elsewhere, including Wagner Group fighters, in its offensive in Ukraine’s Donbas region, a European official said last month. A survivor had previously described to the Guardian how Russian soldiers who were perpetrating a sadistic killing spree lasting days in the village had described Ukraine as a “fairytale” compared with Syria.

300 Wagner mercenaries who participated in a February 2018 offensive in the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor. They cited the open-source research group InformNapalm. Another man, Alexander Alexandrovich Stupnitsky,32, a native of Orsha in Belarus, was identified as a liaison officer for the assault platoon of the Wagner Group’s 1st reconnaissance and assault company. The third man identified as a Wagner member, Sergey Sergeevich Sazonov,33, was born in Kaliningrad and is allegedly the driver of the Wagner Group command vehicle.

Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, has accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world” by saying it is ready to unblock Black Sea ports in return for the lifting of sanctions. Kuleba tweeted that anyone considering accepting Russia’s “game” should “first visit the graves of killed Ukrainian children and talk to their parents”. Ukrainian MP Anastasia Radina has been at the World Economic Forum in Davos, and has spoken to Reuters. She told reporters western countries such as Germany must overcome reluctance to supply Ukraine with modern weapons as Kyiv risks running out of stocks. She said: We have only one choice, and this is to receive modern Nato-style weaponry because we cannot win the war with the Soviet style weaponry that we have. What [the Russians] are doing is waiting for us to run out of weapons or (the) collective west to be less united and more preoccupied with their own problems. Ukraine needs longer range arms after mainly receiving anti-aircraft and anti-tank weapons at the start of the war, Radina said, adding that Kyiv has also asked for ground-based air defence systems to protect Ukrainian cities from attacks. The German government has been considering supplying a surface-to-air defence system built by Diehl to Ukraine, according to a security source, but a deal has not yet been announced. Radina said a system like this could help protect not only Kyiv, but also other cities like Kharkiv, Zaporizhya, Mykolaiv and Odesa: “These are cities that need proper air defence systems even more than Kyiv”. The German government must understand that Ukraine is running out of time, the lawmaker said, adding: Discussion about tanks is just humiliating. This poses a question with whom Germany really sides. It is time Germany proves in action with whom it stands. And proving in action means: stop supplying Russia with money to basically be able to buy weapons and kill Ukrainian civilians and help Ukraine with proper ammunition. Peter Beaumont rounds up the latest developments for us: Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said delays in arrival of western arms to the frontline had left Kyiv “catastrophically short of heavy weapons”. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Haidai added that Russian forces were attempting to “completely destroy” the city of Sievierodonetsk in an attempt to conquer the Donbas region, near Russia’s border. “They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the Earth,” Haidai said on his Telegram channel. After failing to seize Kyiv or Ukraine’s second city, Kharkiv, Russia is trying to take the rest of the separatist-claimed Donbas’s two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front. In the easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskyi Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield as Russian forces have advanced from three directions to encircle them. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report here: Russian assault on eastern Ukraine threatens to encircle Sievierodonetsk Britain’s defence secretary Ben Wallace has called on Russia to let Ukraine export its grain to help countries where grain scarcity could trigger hunger. Russia must “do the right thing”, Wallace told reporters in Madrid where he met with his counterpart Margarita Robles. Reuters reports he rejected the idea to lift sanctions against Russia in return for grain release, but welcomed suggestions that other Black Sea nations might escort Ukraine grain shipments. Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”, Reuters reports. Last week, Italy’s foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio, gave the broad outlines of the plan and said he had discussed it with the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, during a visit to New York. The plan would involve international groups such as the UN, EU and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe to act as facilitators to organise localised ceasefires initially, Di Maio told a news conference in Italy last Friday. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing today: You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other. On Tuesday, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Moscow had not yet seen the Italian peace plan but that it hoped to receive it through diplomatic channels. Zakaharova added: If they hope that the Russian Federation will seize on any Western plan, then they haven’t understood much. Sweden is “obviously” not funding or arming terrorist organisations, its prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said, in response to Turkish claims that it is a hotbed for terrorist groups. Andersson told a Stockholm press conference: We don’t send money to terrorist organisations, obviously, nor any weapons. Her remarks came as Finnish and Swedish delegations began talks with Ankara today, which Andersson said would provide an opportunity to clear up what she said was “confusion” circulating about Swedish support for different groups. She said: We will naturally go through and discuss the list and sort out a number of things that have been unclear in reporting in the media and statements from other places. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, has opposed the Nato membership applications of Sweden and Finland and insisted he will not approve their bids. On Monday, Turkey published a list of five demands for Sweden, including calls for an end to funding and supplying arms to Kurdish groups in Syria. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has signed a decree simplifying the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions. The decree extends a scheme available since 2019 to residents of areas controlled by Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine’s Donetsk and Luhansk regions to acquire Russian citizenship and passports. Applicants are not required to have lived in Russia, do not need to provide evidence of sufficient funds or pass a Russian language test. The southern region of Kherson is under the full control of Russian troops, while the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia is partially controlled by Moscow. Moscow has said both regions could become part of Russia. Ukrainian MP Ivanna Klympush-Tsintsadze said the decree “turns occupation into annexation” and accused Russian forces of “first destroying, then stealing our territories and people”. The occupiers in Kherson and parts of Zaporizhzhia have introduced the rouble as the official currency. Slovakia’s prime minster, Eduard Heger, has warned that “if Ukraine fails, Slovakia is next” during a panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos. From Sky News’ Paul Kelso: Heger went on to criticise EU countries for relying too heavily on Russian energy and urged leaders to “stop compromising” their principles when dealing with Russia. Heger said: We basically traded our values for cheap gas and oil for too long. Compromising with Putin caused a war in Ukraine. An aggressive war, people are dying. Ukraine’s Kalush Orchestra, which won this year’s Eurovision song contest, is auctioning off its trophy to raise funds for the Ukrainian army, the group said. The group’s frontman, Oleh Psiuk, has also offered to sell his signature pink bucket hat, the group announced on Instagram. Last week, Kalush Orchestra said they intended to auction off the Eurovision trophy and donate the money raised through auction to a charity for the support of Ukraine and its armed forces. In a previous announcement, the group said: We plan to put our statuette up for auction and donate all the money to a charity fund that helps the Armed Forces and Ukraine. We are still to select one. See, many people are already donating from abroad, and perhaps many more would like to donate. And this, in our opinion, will be the thing that motivates them. We think it will be beneficial for Ukraine. Former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder has said on his LinkedIn profile that he declined Gazprom’s offer to join its supervisory board, seemingly contradicting the Russian gas company’s announcement that he had been officially nominated for the post. “I passed on the nomination for Gazprom’s supervisory board some time ago,” the post said. I also communicated this to the company. I am therefore surprised by today’s report making claims to the contrary. On Tuesday, Gazprom had announced Schröder had been officially nominated for a post on the committee, following up an earlier report from February, before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In an interview with the New York Times last month, Schröder had failed to give a clear answer on whether he was planning to take the job. Since then, the Social Democrat politician has faced growing pressure in Germany, where the coalition government voted to strip him of some post-office benefits including his office. Last Friday, Russian oil company Rosneft announced Schröder was to quit its supervisory board. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. The Russian state Duma approved a law today removing the upper age limit for contractual service in the country’s military, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. The law was introduced last week by members of the ruling United Russia party, who said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. A note accompanying the proposed law read: For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45. The lawmakers added that the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Hello everyone. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong here again here to bring you all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag – you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Lithuania will transfer 20 M113 armoured personnel carriers as well as military trucks and de-mining vehicles to Ukraine, its defence ministry said. The vehicles are worth a total of €15.5m (£13.2m), the ministry said, Reuters reports. Lithuanian defence minister, Arvydas Anusauskas, said in a statement: The coordinated help from us and the allies is the deciding factor for the Ukrainian victory. Lithuania, which borders the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad as well as a huge stretch of Belarus, is among the European countries most vulnerable to Russian aggression. Previously, Lithuania has provided military support to Ukraine worth €100m, the statement added. Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions, the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. “We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,” Rudenko was quoted as saying, according to Reuters. “And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage, which it does every day.” The Kyiv Independent reports Russian bombing in Kramatorsk, Donetsk (eastern Ukraine): Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has been speaking via video link at a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum: Unity is about weapons. My question is, is there this unity in practice? I can’t see it. Our huge advantage over Russia would be when we are truly united. In particular, he criticised Europe: We are on the European continent and we need the support of a united Europe. He added: Is there this unity regarding the accession of Finland and Sweden to Nato? No, no. So, is there a strong joint west? No. The £4.25bn takeover of Chelsea football club has been completed after Roman Abramovich agreed to the UK government’s terms for the sale, ending a tumultuous period that raised fears over the club’s existence in the wake of the Ukraine war. A new era at Stamford Bridge can officially begin after a bid led by Todd Boehly, a part-owner of baseball’s LA Dodgers, was given permission to go through. The government issued the licence after it said it was “now satisfied that the full proceeds of the sale will not benefit Roman Abramovich or any other sanctioned individual”. Abramovich was hit with sanctions after the Russian invasion. The sale will follow a two-step process under which £2.5bn will go into an escrow account until the government is satisfied the funds will go to a charity for victims of the war in Ukraine. Boehly’s group has committed to invest a further £1.75bn in the club. Crucially, Abramovich has agreed to legally binding guarantees allowing his £1.6bn loan to Chelsea to go into a frozen account under government control. The government has sought assurances that the charity will be independent of Abramovich. Mike Penrose, a former Unicef UK executive director, has been asked to run the foundation. “Late last night the UK government reached a position where we could issue a licence that permits the sale of Chelsea football club,” a government statement said. “Following the sanctioning of Roman Abramovich, the government has worked hard to ensure Chelsea football club has been able to continue to play football. But we have always been clear that the long-term future of the club could only be secured under a new owner.” Igor Volobuyev spent two decades working in the heart of the Russian business establishment, first for Gazprom and then for its affiliate Gazprombank, where until February this year he was vice-president. Then Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine in late February, and Volobuyev decided he could no longer stand living in Russia. He packed a small rucksack of possessions and a stack of cash, and flew out of the country on 2 March, pretending he was going on holiday. A few days later, he crossed from Poland into Ukraine, where he spent his childhood years. Now, he spends his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service. “I want to go to the place where I can defend my homeland with a weapon, I’m trying every day,” he said, in an interview in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. “I am never going back to Russia.” Hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have fled the country since Putin launched the war, and many intellectuals, journalists and activists have voiced their opposition to the conflict. However, among the political and business elites, defections have been extremely rare. Despite reports of widespread dismay over the invasion of Ukraine, only a tiny handful of people have spoken publicly to condemn the war. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv in western Ukraine, has posted his latest update for the region. He reports that overnight there were two air raid warnings, including one sparked “as the enemy launched missiles from the Black Sea”, but he says “the threats did not materialise. Everything is calm in Lviv region.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has spoken again at the World Economic Forum in Davos this morning. Reuters reports he told an audience that he was only willing to talk directly to Vladimir Putin and not via intermediators. He added that if the Russian president “understands reality” there was the possibility of finding a diplomatic way out of the conflict. The Ukrainian president said Moscow should withdraw its troops back to the lines in place before Russia began its invasion on 24 February. “That might be a first step towards talks,” he said, adding that Russia has been playing for time in its talks with Ukraine. Yesterday a close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, said any peace would have to recognise that “final” decisions had already been made about the future of the breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, and that any peace deal that suggested Russia should pull out of Crimea would be treated as a threat of war. Russia’s RIA Novosti is carrying some quotes from Rodion Miroshnik, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic’s ambassador to Russia. He said their forces, alongside the Russian army and fighters from the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, have broken through Ukrainian defences in the Luhansk region. He posted on Telegram: Ukrainian defence is crumbling. An active assault on Zolote is underway. The peacekeeping forces are advancing towards Maloryazantsevo, Volcheyarovka. What part of the Ukrainian military formations left these settlements, and what part remained, is not yet known exactly, but the trend is clearly visible. I’ll hand over now to my colleague Martin Belam in London. Nike has reportedly decided not to renew a franchising agreement with Inventive Retail Group, a company that operates 37 Nike-branded retail stores in Russia. The company temporarily closed all of its own stores in Russia in March, and has halted web sales in the country. More from AFP: In the village of Yakovlivka, 55-year-old Ukrainian soldier Andriy hid in a ditch as shells fired by encroaching Russians whistled past. “Our guys have stopped firing back,” he whispered after glancing up and down the road. “We do not want to provoke them, because then the Russians will start shooting at us even harder.” Russian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine and attacking key cities, particularly the industrial city of Severodonetsk, the AFP has reported. Sergiy Gaidai, governor of the eastern region of Lugansk, said Sievierodonetsk was being hammered by air strikes, rockets, artillery and mortars in a bid to solidify control over the province and move further into Ukraine. “The situation is very difficult and unfortunately it is only getting worse,” Gaidai said, describing what he termed a “full-scale offensive in all directions” in a video on Telegram. “The Russian army has decided to completely destroy Sievierodonetsk. They are simply erasing Sievierodonetsk from the face of the earth,” he said. Thousands of troops were sent to capture Lugansk region, Gaidai said, adding that the bombardment of Sievierodonetsk was so intense it was too late for its 15,000 civilians to leave. In Moscow, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu made it clear Russia was settling in for a long war. In an age of social media and satellite television, the singular wartime news bulletin evokes images of families tuning in to the radio during the second world war. But in Ukraine, the state-backed broadcast has remerged, albeit with a 21st-century spin. Shortly after Russia invaded, the country’s main TV channels started broadcasting the same content 24 hours a day, nicknamed the United News telemarathon. Each channel has a daily slot on the broadcast, which is shown simultaneously on all the channels. United News was initially aired by five channels owned by various Ukrainian oligarchs as well as the publicly owned channels. It has since been signed into law and now includes all Ukrainian channels that used to show news. The head of Ukraine’s parliamentary broadcasting committee said he believed the arrangement should continue until the war ends. While some say there are critical strategic justifications for the telemarathon, others argue that it amounts to a monopoly of the information space by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s team and could be exploited for political purposes. “The telemarathon is the information war equivalent of our anti-aircraft systems and I think it’s the most optimal option for Ukraine right now,” said Svitlana Ostapa, the deputy head of Detector Media, a media monitoring organisation that tracks propaganda, disinformation and political interference in Ukraine. “It helps protect Ukrainians from Russian fakes and prevents panic among the population. In 2014, Russian propagandists and their allies released a barrage of disinformation about the Maidan revolution, Crimea and events in eastern Ukraine that experts said worked to destabilise the country. There are also more practical reasons for the channels working together. “Most of the journalists left Kyiv and the channels simply could not cope individually,” Ostapa said. “The top ministers and officials do not have the time to comment to more than half a dozen channels, and this format means they are communicating with the population once a day and not being seen to favour one channel.” Read more: Brazil has turned to natural fertilisers over concerns that the war in Ukraine will disrupt crucial fertiliser imports, AFP has reported. The agricultural superpower is the world’s fourth-biggest consumer of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium based fertilisers and imports 80% of its supply, 25% of which comes from Russia. From AFP: That is causing farmers in the South American giant to turn to alternatives, including remineralizers, or “agrominerals” - pulverized, nutrient-rich rocks that are spread on fields before planting. Brazil, which authorized remineralizers for agricultural use in 2013, is the world leader in the technique, which is also used in the United States, Canada, India and France, among others. “Brazil is a tropical country, and the rains tend to wash away soil nutrients. Rock powder rebuilds the soil and renews it,” says Marcio Remedio, mineral resources director at the Brazilian Geological Service. The technique also “allows plants’ roots to develop better and capture the nutrients they need to grow,” says Suzi Huff Theodoro, a geologist at the University of Brasilia. “We have rocks with the right profile in various parts of the country, and the cost is significantly cheaper” than chemical fertilisers, she told AFP. Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered a video address on Tuesday to mark the three month anniversary of the invasion of Ukraine, and said the country’s ability to resist Russia had been a surprise and a source of inspiration to the rest of the world. We must always remember that we have survived these three months thanks to tens and thousands of feats of those who have defended the state. And at the cost of tens of thousands of lives of Ukrainian men and women killed by the occupiers. Zelenskiy then mocked the claim by Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu that Russia was deliberately slowing down its offensive in Ukraine to allow civilians time to evacuate. He said: Well after three months of searching for an explanation why they failed to break Ukraine in three days, they came up with nothing better than to say they had allegedly planned to do so. He then spoke of the worsening situation in the Donbas region, and called for foreign governments to continue to provide military support in the form of weapons and equipment, saying that was “the best investment in maintaining stability in the world.” Our reporter Isobel Koshiw in Kyiv has some more information on the Ukrainian soldiers who were captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant. The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the steel works surrendered on Friday. Koshiw writes: Denys Prokopenko, commander of the Azov battalion, was able to briefly call his wife, Kateryna, who said she had also been told that the prisoners had not been subjected to violence. It was not immediately clear if Prokopenko had been able to speak freely during the conversation. “He said he was ‘OK’ and asked how I was,” Kateryna Prokopenko told the Guardian on Tuesday. “I’ve heard from other sources that the conditions are more or less satisfactory.” At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. The Azov battalion has played a central role in Russia’s justification for its invasion, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. Officials in Kyiv have suggested they could be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials have called for them to face trial or even execution on “terrorism” charges. The Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, has declared a state of emergency due to the war in neighbouring Ukraine. Orban, who was returned to power for a fourth consecutive term in April, announced in a Facebook video that his government would assume emergency powers in order to be able to respond more quickly to the challenges created by the war. It will allow the Hungarian government to approve measures by decree. Orban said: The world is on the brink of an economic crisis. The first measures will be announced on Wednesday, he said. Ukraine has already started using long-range cannons it received from France government officials have said. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, promised to send a shipment of the Ceaser cannons, which are described as “the trump card of the French artillery”, at the start of the month. Ukrainian infrastructure minister Volodymyr Omelyan shared the update from the Ukrinian army’s commander-in-chief, Valery Zaluzhny, on Tuesday night. He said the long-range weapons had been rolled out after artillerymen had received two or three hours of training. As we’ve reported, Russian forces are currently attempting to seize Donbas’ two provinces, Donetsk and Luhansk, and trap Ukrainian forces in a pocket on the main eastern front. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said that Moscow was seeking to destroy the industrial Donbas region. More from Reuters: Russian forces took control of three towns in the Donetsk region including Svitlodarsk, regional governor Pavlo Kyrylenko told an affiliate of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. “The situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. All the remaining strength of the Russian army is now concentrated on this region,” Zelenskiy said in a late Tuesday address. “The occupiers want to destroy everything there.” Russia’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment out-of-hours. The easternmost part of the Ukrainian-held Donbas pocket, the city of Sievierodonetsk on the east bank of the Siverskiy Donets River and its twin Lysychansk, on the west bank, have become a pivotal battlefield. Russian forces were advancing from three directions to encircle them. “The enemy has focused its efforts on carrying out an offensive in order to encircle Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk,” said Serhiy Gaidai, governor of Luhansk province, where the two cities are among the last territory held by Ukraine. Ukraine’s military said it had repelled nine Russian attacks on Tuesday in the Donbas where Moscow’s troops had killed at least 14 civilians, using aircraft, rocket launchers, artillery, tanks, mortars and missiles. Reuters could not immediately verify the information. Hello and welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Calla Wahlquist and I’ll be taking you through developments for the next few hours. This is how things currently stand: Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned that Moscow was seeking to destroy the industrial Donbas region amid intense fighting in the eastern region. The Ukrainian president said in his nightly address on Tuesday that “the situation in Donbas is extremely difficult. All the remaining strength of the Russian army is now concentrated on this region”. Russian forces have taken control of three Donetsk towns including Svitlodarsk, according to the regional governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, with the key city of Sievierodonestsk surrounded on three sides. The governor of Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region said the situation there “is only getting worse” as Russian troops advance. “It is getting worse with every day and even with every hour,” said governor Sergiy Gaidai. “They are simply eliminating Sievierodonestsk from the earth.” The bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building. Ukrainian soldiers captured by Russian forces after the three-month siege of the Azovstal steel plant are being held in “satisfactory” conditions, according to the unit commander’s wife, amid uncertainty over the fate of the prisoners. At least 1,000 Ukrainian fighters, including members of the Azov battalion, were transferred to Russian-held territory last week after the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol was taken by Russian forces. Ukraine is gathering the bodies of dead Russian soldiers found in formerly occupied towns in the hope of exchanging them for prisoners of war or for Ukrainian bodies. In Kharkiv, 60 bodies were retrieved and stacked in a refrigerated rail carriage, Reuters reports. Ukrainian prosecutors have launched a war crimes investigation in Kharkiv’s Gorky Park which was hit by about 50 shells in three months of war. “Hitting civilian targets, civilian infrastructure, trying to kill civilians and destroy cultural heritage, are considered war crimes. An error can happen once or twice, but there are 56 hits recorded. It’s not an accident. They were targeting the park,” Ukrainian prosecutor Roman Petrenko said. A new survey has found that 82% of Ukrainians believe that their country should not sign away any of its territories as part of a peace deal with Russia under any circumstances Turkish officials will meet with Swedish and Finnish delegations in Ankara on Wednesday to discuss the Nato bids by the two Nordic countries. Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said his country and Sweden would send delegations to the Turkish capital to try to resolve its opposition to their applications for membership in the military alliance. A Russian court has rejected an appeal from opposition leader Alexei Navalny against a nine-year prison sentence he is serving for large-scale fraud and contempt of court, charges which he denies. Navalny lambasted President Vladimir Putin during court hearing, casting him as a madman who had started a “stupid war” in Ukraine based on lies. Russia’s foreign ministry has announced a ban on 154 members of the British parliament’s House of Lords on entering the country, in a tit-for-tat move for sanctions against Russian officials over Ukraine. It accused them of having “used their authority to whip up anti-Russian hysteria in the UK”. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine threatens to be the “beginning of the third world war” that could spell the end of civilisation," the veteran philanthropist and former financier George Soros has warned from the World Economic Forum in Davos that autocratic regimes were in the ascendant and the global economy was heading for a depression.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK to send long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine despite Russian threats,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/uk-to-send-long-range-rocket-artillery-to-ukraine-despite-russian-threats,2022-06-05T23:01:18Z,M270 launch systems have 50-mile range and can target Russian artillery that has been attacking cities in eastern Ukraine,"Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, despite a threat on Sunday from Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, to bomb fresh targets if similar weapons from the US were delivered to Kyiv. The UK will send a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 50 miles away, in the hope they can disrupt the concentrated Russian artillery that has been pounding cities in eastern Ukraine. Ben Wallace, the UK defence secretary, argued the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. The move risks further provoking an already irritated Kremlin. Before the British announcement, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would retaliate further if the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” said the Russian leader, who has been closely involved with operational military decisions throughout the three months-plus of the war. He did not specify what those targets were. In the small hours of Sunday morning, Russian cruise missiles struck a railway depot in the eastern Dniprovsky suburb of Kyiv. Ukraine said the strike hit a rail car repair works; Moscow said it had destroyed tanks sent by eastern European countries to Ukraine. It was the first time anywhere in the capital has been hit for over five weeks. One person was hospitalised, and a plume of smoke rose and was visible from high points in the capital. Five cruise missiles were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. Kyiv was last hit on 28 April. Russia’s ministry of defence claimed it was targeting an arsenal of T-72 tanks that had been delivered from eastern European countries, suggesting it now wants to target the supply of western arms. But Ukrainian officials said the statement was false. Oleksandr Kamyshin, the chairman of the board of Ukrainian Railways, said: “There are no such tanks at the plant, as well as no military equipment. There are only cars that we repair. These carriages we need for export – these are, in particular, grain carriages.” The UK, in conjunction with the US and other western nations, began the war by promising only to supply “defensive weaponry” to help Ukraine repel the Russian invasion. But as Russia has made gains in the east and the south of the country, western countries have gradually sent more lethal arms. London said it had been cooperating closely with Washington. The British announcement comes a few days after the US said it would send four similar truck-mounted Himars systems. The US and UK systems are intended to be complementary. The ranges of both are far greater than any land weapons Ukraine currently has. Like the US, the UK has sought assurances from Kyiv that the M270s would not be used to strike targets within Russia. A British defence source said the weapons will be used “to defend Ukraine, in Ukraine”. They added: “We have confidence that the weapons will be used appropriately.” Britain did not say how many M270s it was sending, although the number is small and will be comparable to the US decision to send four Himars. Ukrainian troops will be trained on how to use the launchers in the UK, the MoD added, and Kyiv’s forces will be supplied with the appropriate rockets “at scale”. However, Putin said he believed the west’s goal was to prolong the war in Ukraine, which has now gone on for over three months, after the Russian president launched an unprovoked invasion on 24 February. “All this fuss around additional deliveries of weapons, in my opinion, has only one goal: to drag out the armed conflict as much as possible,” Putin added. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company, Energoatom, also warned on Sunday that a Russian cruise missile had come dangerously close to the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. It said the missile “flew critically low” over the site and that Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak”. Elsewhere, Britain’s Ministry of Defence said that Ukrainian forces had counterattacked in Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained” but offered no assessment of whether the effort was pushing the invaders back. On Saturday, Serhiy Haidai, the Ukrainian governor of Luhansk province, said his country’s forces had regained about 20% of the city in Donbas, which had been under days of attack from concentrated Russian shelling and airstrikes. Haidai repeated that claim on Sunday, adding that eight Russians had been taken prisoner and that the occupiers had “lost a huge number of personnel”. A humanitarian headquarters in neighbouring Lysychansk had been struck with 30 shells overnight, the governor said. Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”, said the Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, overnight. The research group, which closely monitors the fighting, said that Russia “may still be able to capture Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk” and that it appeared that “Ukrainian defences remain strong in this pivotal theatre”. Britain’s Ministry of Defence said Russia was relying on “poorly equipped and trained” separatist forces from Luhansk to conduct the clearance of the city, a tactic it said had been previously employed by Moscow’s forces in Syria. “This approach likely indicates a desire to limit casualties suffered by regular Russian forces,” it added. One Ukrainian presidential adviser urged European nations to respond with “more sanctions, more weapons” to the strike on Kyiv – and appeared to criticise the French president, Emmanuel Macron, who had said in an interview on Friday that Russia must not be humiliated in Ukraine so that a diplomatic solution could eventually be found. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of the president’s office, tweeted: “While someone asks not to humiliate Russia, the Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today’s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal – kill as many Ukrainians as possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Some UK public swimming pools forced to close over national chlorine shortage,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/some-uk-public-swimming-pools-forced-to-close-over-national-chlorine-shortage,2022-05-13T16:06:24Z,Factors from Brexit to lower production in China to war in Ukraine fuel limited supplies of pool chemicals,"A shortage of chlorine is forcing some public swimming pools to close, with operators blaming factors ranging from a production fall in China to Brexit and the war in Ukraine. Saxon Pool in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, has been closed to general swimmers since 6 May, with the operator and Central Bedfordshire council cancelling almost all sessions, apart from swimming lessons and a swimathon event. Users were informed via email: “Unfortunately, due to a nationwide issue, SLL have been unable to secure orders of pool chemicals from Europe which is essential to operate the pool fully.” According to its website, most users will be unable to swim until more chemicals arrive. The council said deliveries were expected next week. Runnymede Leisure Centre in Benfleet had to close its pool one weekend in April after running out of Melclorite, a type of chlorine, which came from Japan and was supplied by Brenntag, a German company which has flagged global supply issues, including the war in Ukraine. At the University of East Anglia, the pool closed for five days, with managers citing “severely depleted” levels of chlorine gas in the UK. It reopened on 10 May after a delivery, announcing the good news to users by tweeting: “Swimming is back.” Industry experts have pointed to a variety of reasons for the supply disruptions. “Some pool chemical companies are experiencing supply chain difficulties,” said Chris Hayes, managing director for the UK’s Swimming Pool and Allied Trades Association. “These can be attributed to a number of issues, including a temporarily reduced supply in the UK, a backlog coming from China’s supply chain caused by Covid, a significant fire in a US chemical plant in late 2020 and worldwide transportation issues. We are aware that some public pools have needed to close temporarily, and chemical suppliers will be working with these leisure facilities to look at other appropriate pool chemicals that can be used.” The Pool Water Treatment Advisory Group (PWTAG), a UK-based independent membership organisation, said there was a national shortage of calcium hypochlorite, a solid form of chlorine. This has driven up prices by between 50% and 60%. Janice Calvert, the group’s chair, said manufacturing in China had declined, particularly in the run-up to the winter Olympics, because Beijing has been tightening up on environmental pollution and closing down factories that were non-compliant. She added there was a problem shipping chemicals from China to the UK, with the only route now being via Antwerp. Moreover, INEOS, the main manufacturer of sodium hypochlorite (a liquid form of chloride) in the UK, shut down its plant for May and part of June. As a result of Brexit, chlorine manufacturers have to obtain separate regulatory approval for their products in the UK as well as the EU, at an initial cost of £100,000 per product, but approvals only last 10 years, in a relatively small market. This has led some suppliers to buy from others that have approval, which means there are only two main suppliers left in the UK, said PWTAG. The Chemical Business Association said: “The horrific situation in Ukraine has wrought further havoc on an already heavily disrupted chemical supply chain caused by factors such as Covid, Brexit or driver shortages.” • This article was amended on 17 May 2022. An earlier version said that Runnymede Leisure Centre had reportedly obtained Melclorite from manufacturers in Ukraine; it came from Japan and was supplied by Brenntag, a German company which has flagged global supply issues, including the war in Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What does EU’s partial oil ban mean for Russia and rest of Europe?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/31/what-does-eu-partial-oil-ban-mean-for-russia-and-rest-of-europe,2022-05-31T09:47:18Z,"Ban on seaborne oil aims to cut off funds for Kremlin war machine, but some warn it could help Moscow in short term","What has been agreed? After nearly a month of wrangling, the European Union has agreed to a partial ban on Russian oil, with the aim of cutting off funding to the Kremlin’s war machine. According to the European Council president, Charles Michel, three-quarters of Russian oil imports will be immediately affected, rising to 90% by the end of the year. What countries have been exempted and why? The EU is banning seaborne oil immediately, which covers about two-thirds of Russian imports to the EU. Oil transported through the critical Druzhba (“friendship”) pipeline will be exempt from the ban, a key concession to Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil. The EU is confident most Russian oil flows will cease by the end of the year, because Germany and Poland, countries on the northern branch of Druzhba, have promised to forgo its supplies. Countries on the southern branch of the Soviet-era pipeline – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – will benefit from the temporary exemption. When will the EU move to a complete oil embargo? That is not clear. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president who has been driving sanctions policy, promised the EU would discuss how to close the loophole “as soon as possible”. Hungary is seeking EU cash to retool its oil refineries that can only take Russian crude. Croatia also needs time to boost supplies to its northern neighbour through the Adria pipeline. EU leaders have avoided giving details on the end date of the exemption for central Europe. How will the embargo affect Russia’s war machine? The EU is paying Russia about €1bn (£850m) a day for oil and gas, an invaluable source of hard currency for the Kremlin in funding its war against Ukraine. A sharp cut in those financial flows deepens Russia’s economic problems in the long term. Some economists have warned, however, that it could have the perverse effect of helping Moscow in the short term, as Russia benefits from high prices. The EU’s lengthy discussions have also given Russia time to find alternative buyers. What will the impact be on consumers and businesses in Europe? Motorists and businesses will see higher prices at the pumps, as the embargo feeds into higher oil prices. Governments will find it even harder to manage the already soaring cost of living. After the announcement of the EU oil embargo, the price of a barrel of Brent crude hit $124.10 (£98.59), its highest level since March, although it dropped back a little in later trading. Oil prices have already risen more than 55% this year and are at their highest levels since 2008. Does the EU have more sanctions cards to play? Before the EU had even agreed on the oil embargo, some countries were already considering further sanctions against Russia’s biggest export: gas. Before the war, Russia supplied 40% of EU gas but EU leaders have promised to gradually phase this out. However, Ukraine’s most outspoken allies in the EU, Poland and the Baltic states, think the EU should now put an end date on Russian gas. That step is far from assured and will be even harder than talks on the unfinished oil embargo.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘Giving hope’: UK universities twin with struggling Ukraine counterparts,https://www.theguardian.com/education/2022/may/14/giving-hope-uk-universities-twin-with-struggling-ukraine-counterparts,2022-05-14T06:30:02Z,"From sourcing window glass to sharing online lectures, British institutions are helping war-torn campuses to survive","When Prof Gavin Brown, pro vice-chancellor at Liverpool University, first made contact with academics at Sumy State University (SSU) in north-eastern Ukraine a few weeks ago, he did not expect to come off the call and start ordering new windows. One of SSU’s main buildings had been destroyed in a Russian bomb attack. Among the university’s many immediate needs, it had to replace 110 windows – but managers could not source glass in war-torn Ukraine. Brown told them to send him the measurements. Liverpool is one of 44 British universities that have signed up in recent weeks to “twin” with a struggling Ukrainian university. UK academics say the weekly Zoom meetings, slotted in around air raid sirens, with female staff who have fled calling in from across Europe, are “humbling” and “emotional”. The idea is to make sure that when the war with Russia ends, Ukraine’s universities will still exist, so their staff and students can help rebuild the battered country. Fortunately, Liverpool University happens to have its own building company with connections to glass manufacturers, and Brown has heard that supplies like this are making it across Ukraine. “This is about understanding what these universities need and offering real, practical help,” he says. The challenges do not stop here. “Many female staff have left and are trying to do what work they can from a distance. Many male staff are fighting,” Brown says. Universities at the sharp end of the invasion in eastern Ukraine believe all their female students have fled the region, with many leaving the country. But the universities do not want to lose them. Liverpool plans to share online teaching materials to keep SSU students engaged. The university may also take in some of the staff, helping them to put lectures and lab experiments online for their colleagues at home. Brown emphasises his university will be a temporary base and when the time is right, the staff will return. “It is clearly a fear of the Ukrainian universities that there will be a brain drain,” he says. Liverpool, unlike some western universities, has deliberately not offered scholarships to fleeing Ukrainian students who may want to transfer. Brown says that if recipients decide not to go back this would do significant harm. “The whole point of what we are doing is to try to support Sumy students to continue to study with their own university,” he says. “They will be critical in helping with the rebuilding of Ukraine.” Kyiv National University of Technologies and Design has told its new twin, Sheffield Hallam University, that the main help needed is with motivating their displaced students to study again. James Richardson, director of global development and partnerships at Sheffield Hallam, says this is no small task as students fleeing the war will have more immediate priorities than resuming their course. And, crucially, the university does not know where most of them are. “We understand pretty much all of their female staff have left Kyiv or have left Ukraine altogether. This has resulted in them having no functional administration,” he says. In Kyiv, air raid sirens go off every day and night. Richardson’s main contact at the Ukrainian university has to schedule meetings around when he is next on patrol. “I know staff who are still there are cold,” Richardson says. “The first call we had, they said it was -3C at night and they are in unheated cellars. From outside we might think things are quieter in Kyiv, but they feel very much under attack.” The two universities have many overlapping courses, and Sheffield Hallam wants to share resources such as online lectures, recorded during the pandemic. Many of the Ukrainian students speak English, so language will not be a significant barrier. “The biggest challenge is going to be connecting with the students to tell them about it,” he says. Richardson hopes to bring staff and students at both universities together on virtual projects in the autumn. However, he says: “Right now they aren’t really functioning so it will be hard to offer much other than our support. But we are in this for the long term, planning for next year and a long way beyond.” Their last Zoom call, which 12 Ukrainian academics joined from across Ukraine and Europe, was “emotional”. Richardson says: “I think it meant a lot to them to know there is another institution that is simply there for them.” “This is about giving them hope,” he adds. “It is a reminder that they are fighting for something important. Universities are a huge part of their social and cultural fabric, as well as their economic future.” Charles Cormack, founder of Cormack Consultancy Group, which is running the twinning scheme alongside the vice-chancellors’ group Universities UK, says what UK universities are doing is listening to what their Ukrainian colleagues need. “At the meetings I’ve been involved in you just don’t hear the word ‘no’.” York University has twinned with Karazin Kharkiv National University, one of Ukraine’s most prestigious institutions, whose buildings are in ruins from shelling. Prof Saul Tendler, deputy vice-chancellor at York, says one of the Ukrainian university’s many worries is protecting its libraries and archive collections. “They tell us they are in damp basements now and that’s not great,” he says. “If they can get them out of the country, we will hold them in our repositories.” Like other universities, York is exploring offering summer schools for Ukrainian students, either in the city or virtually. Karazin also wants York to run summer sessions for its staff on moving teaching online, likely to be necessary for some time given the condition of the university’s buildings. However, even communicating can be a challenge. Tendler says: “They are enduring unbelievable suffering, spending large parts of their lives in bomb shelters.” Karazin’s leaders have said the collaboration must be “one good deed at a time”, because of the stresses they are under. As Tendler says: “You’d love to be able to wrap your arms around them and do lots of things very fast, but actually right now they can’t cope with that.” Glasgow University has been asked by its twin, the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, to provide up to 100 places for female students across a range of disciplines to study at Glasgow for the first semester next year. The Scottish university plans to waive all fees and is exploring what accommodation and extra financial support it can offer. Rachel Sandison, deputy vice-chancellor for external engagement, says her conversations with Ukrainian colleagues are “humbling” and “heartbreaking”, but she takes solace from knowing they are doing some good. Richardson, at Sheffield Hallam, says: “When this is all over, if there were no Ukrainian universities because buildings have been destroyed and staff and students have just left, it would take generations to rebuild.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Putin warns that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/05/russia-ukraine-war-latest-explosions-shake-kyiv-macron-rebuked-for-saying-russia-cant-be-humiliated-live,2022-06-06T00:25:11Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand as of 3.30am. Russia struck Ukraine’s capital Kyiv with missiles early on Sunday for the first time in more than a month. A railway depot was hit in the eastern suburb of Dniprovsky. Five cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea were launched from Tu-95 bombers, one of which was intercepted, Ukraine’s air force said, in an attack that represented a change of approach on the part of Russian forces. A Russian cruise missile “flew critically low” over the Pivdennoukrainsk nuclear power plant, in the south of the country, at about 5.30am, apparently heading for Kyiv. Ukraine’s nuclear energy company Energoatom said Russian forces “still do not understand that even the smallest fragment of a missile that can hit a working power unit can cause a nuclear catastrophe and radiation leak” in a statement on Sunday. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that Moscow will hit new targets if the west supplies Ukraine with long-range missiles. “We will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting,” Putin told Rossiya state television, without specifying what those targets were. The comments were made in response to a pledge from the US went through with the delivery of Himars rocket artillery that the White House promised last week. Ukrainian forces have counterattacked and retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk in the east of the country, officials said. “It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back,” Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai told Ukrainian television. “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” The Institute for the Study of War, a US thinktank, also said Ukrainian forces were “successfully slowing down Russian operations” in Donbas and were making “effective local counterattacks in Sievierodonetsk”. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions as well as the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia on Sunday. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to local media reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday. “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Britain is to supply long-range rocket artillery to Ukraine, including a handful of tracked M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which can hit targets up to 80km (50 miles) away. UK defence secretary Ben Wallace said the decision to ship the rocket launchers was justified because “as Russia’s tactics change, so must our support to Ukraine”. Spain is also to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including Finland and Sweden whom aspire to join the military alliance. “It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. Spain is to supply Ukraine with anti-aircraft missiles and Leopard battle tanks in a step up of its military support to the country, according to government sources cited by newspaper El Pais. Spain will also provide essential training to the Ukrainian military in how to use the tanks, according to the reports as cited by Reuters. Training would take place in Latvia, where the Spanish army has deployed 500 soldiers within the framework of Nato’s Enhanced Advanced Presence operation. A second phase of training could take place in Spain, according to the sources cited by El Pais. The paper said Spain’s defence ministry is finalising a delivery to Kyiv of low-level Shorad Aspide anti-aircraft missiles, which the Spanish army has replaced with a more advanced system. Spain has so far supplied ammunition, individual protection equipment and light weapons. Russia’s sanctions against Gazprom Germania and its subsidiaries could cost German taxpayers and gas users an extra €5bn ($5.4bn) a year to pay for replacement gas, the Welt am Sonntag weekly reported, citing industry representatives. In May, Russia decided to stop supplying Gazprom Germania, which had been the German subsidiary of Gazprom, after Berlin put the company under trustee management due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Since then, the Bundesnetzagentur energy regulator, acting as trustee, has had to buy replacement gas on the market to fulfil supply contracts with German municipal utilities and regional suppliers. Welt am Sonntag reported that Economy Minister Robert Habeck estimates an extra 10m cubic meters per day are required, which would currently cost about €3.5bn a year. Further costs arise from the filling of the Rehden natural gas storage facility which Habeck ordered on Wednesday, it said. The paper also said the additional costs would be passed on to energy suppliers and end customers in the form of a gas levy from October. Nato kicked off nearly a two-week US-led naval exercise on the Baltic Sea on Sunday with more than 7,000 sailors, airmen and marines from 16 nations, including two aspiring to join the military alliance, Finland and Sweden. The annual BALTOPS naval exercise, initiated in 1972, is not held in response to any specific threat. But the military alliance said that “with both Sweden and Finland participating, Nato is seizing the chance in an unpredictable world to enhance its joint force resilience and strength” together with two Nordic aspirant nations, according to a report from the Associated Press. Finland and Sweden decided to apply to join Nato in May as a direct result of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, despite repeated warnings from Moscow against joining the western military alliance. Ahead of the naval drill, which involved 45 vessels and 75 aircraft, the top US military official said in Sweden the host of the BALTOPS 22 exercise that it was particularly important for Nato to show support to the governments in Helsinki and Stockholm. It is important for us, the United States, and the other Nato countries to show solidarity with both Finland and Sweden in this exercise,” US Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Saturday during a news conference aboard the large amphibious warship USS Kearsarge, which was moored in central Stockholm. Milley said from Moscow’s perspective, Finland and Sweden joining Nato will be “very problematic” and leave Russia in a difficult military position as the Baltic Sea’s coastline would be almost completely encircled by Nato members, except for Russia’s Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and the Russian city of St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas. The United States has never before moved such a large warship as the 843-foot USS Kearsarge in the Swedish capital, where it sailed through narrow passages in the Stockholm archipelago, Milley said. As Nato’s close partners, Finland and Sweden have participated in the naval drill since the mid-1990s. Vice Adm. Gene Black, commander Naval Striking and Support Forces Nato and US Sixth Fleet, added: In past iterations of BALTOPS we’ve talked about meeting the challenges of tomorrow. Those challenges are upon us - in the here and now.” BALTOPS 22 is scheduled to end in the German port of Kiel on June 17. Participating nations include Belgium, Bulgaria, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. These countries will exercise a myriad of capabilities demonstrating the inherent flexibility of maritime forces. Exercise scenarios include amphibious operations, gunnery, anti-submarine, air defence, mine clearance operations, explosive ordnance disposal, unmanned underwater vehicles, and medical response, according to an official statement. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov’s visit to Serbia has been cancelled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace to his aircraft, according to reports. A senior foreign ministry source told the Interfax news agency that Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro had closed their airspace to the plane that would have carried Moscow’s top diplomat to Belgrade on Monday “Our diplomacy has yet to master teleportation,” the source said. Serbia, which has close cultural ties with Russia, has fended off pressure to take sides over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and has not joined western sanctions against Moscow. Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic agreed last month that Russia would continue supplying natural gas to Serbia, while other countries have been cut off for refusing to pay for Russian gas in roubles. Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić will address the nation on Monday night regarding the cancellation of Lavrov’s visit to Belgrade, according to local media reports. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited his troops on Ukraine’s eastern frontlines on Sunday to understand the position of Ukrainian defenders as Russia’s assault on Donbas continues. According to a release from his office, Zelenskiy visited command posts and frontline positions of Ukrainian troops in the area of Bakhmut in the Donetsk region and Lysychansk in the Luhansk region. “The president heard information on the operational situation in these parts of the front, as well as a report on the logistics of Ukrainian defenders,” the statement read. Earlier in the day, Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the southeastern region of Zaporizhzhia. Oleksandr Starukh, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region told Zelenskiy that some 60% of the region’s territory is under Russian occupation, with more than 2,700 infrastructure objects either damaged or destroyed. Humanitarian hubs have been set up in the Zaporizhzhia region to shelter residents of the temporarily occupied territories and settlements where hostilities continue. “Over the last 15 days the largest number of people have come from the Kherson region. They also come from Mariupol,” Starukh said. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since 28 April. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” he said. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. A Russian general, Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov, was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Samantha Lock, in Australia. Thank you. A Ukrainian lawmaker, Yevhen Yakovenko, was detained at the Moldovan border at the request of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, Moldova’s border police said on Sunday. Reuters reports: Yakovenko was placed in a pretrial detention centre, a press service representative of the border police said. Viorel Tentiu, the head of Interpol in Moldova, said in a statement that Yakovenko was put on the list following accusations from Belarus of bribery and corruption. A search of public records for wanted persons on the Interpol website for Yakovenko’s name did not produce any results on Sunday night. Ukraine and Belarus officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Yakovenko was elected to the Ukrainian parliament, the Verkhovna Rada, from the Donetsk region, according to information on the parliament’s website. Fears have grown recently that Moldova could be drawn in to the conflict in neighbouring Ukraine, after pro-Russian separatists in a breakaway region reported a number of attacks and explosions there, which they blamed on Kyiv. Moldova, a country of around 2.6 million people wedged between Ukraine and Romania, has taken a decisive pro-Western political turn since President Maia Sandu took office at the end of 2020, defeating a Moscow-aligned incumbent. The country has an ethnic Romanian majority but a large and influential Russian-speaking minority, and close economic ties to Moscow. Russia has announced that it destroyed tanks supplied by eastern European countries in airstrikes on Kyiv. “High-precision, long-range missiles fired by the Russian Aerospace Forces on the outskirts of Kyiv destroyed T-72 tanks supplied by eastern European countries and other armoured vehicles that were in hangars,” Russian defence ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said. On Sunday, Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said that Kyiv had been targeted by “several explosions in Darnytsky and Dniprovsky districts of city”, the first such strikes on the capital since April 28. Several cruise missiles were fired towards Kyiv by Russian TU-95 planes from the Caspian Sea, one of which was destroyed, said the Ukrainian air force. Volodymyr Zelenskiy visited frontline troops in the south-eastern region of Zaporizhzhia, his office said on Sunday, a week after a similar trip to the north-eastern Kharkiv region. Reuters reports: “I want to thank you for your great work, for your service, for protecting all of us, our state,” the statement quoted the Ukrainian president as saying, adding that he held a minute of silence for fallen troops. Zelenskiy’s office later said the president also visited a medical facility in the region and spoke with people forced to leave their homes, including from Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands after being under siege for weeks. He promised action to ensure that all displaced people would be properly rehoused. “We will truly help you tackle this issue,” the president’s office quoted him as saying. Vladimir Putin said today that Moscow would strike at new targets if the west supplied Ukraine with long-range missiles, hours after several explosions rocked the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv. The Russian leader said long-range missile supplies being sent to Ukraine meant that “we will draw the appropriate conclusions and use our arms ... to strike targets we haven’t hit before”. He did not specify which targets he meant. Images have emerged from the Russian missile attack this morning that struck a facility working on railway cars used for grain transport. A Russian general was killed in eastern Ukraine, a Russian state media journalist said on Sunday, adding to the string of high-ranking military casualties sustained by Moscow. Reuters reports: The report, published on the Telegram messaging app by state television reporter Alexander Sladkov, did not say precisely when and where Maj Gen Roman Kutuzov was killed. There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister has reaffirmed the country’s need for continous military assistance from western countries in order to overcome Moscow’s military campaign. “We have already entered into a protracted war and we will need constant support,” Ganna Malyar told local media on Sunday. “The west must understand that its help cannot be a one-time thing, but something that continues until our victory,” she said. Earlier this week, the US announced that long-range weapons were being sent to Ukraine as part of a $700m (£560m) package that includes air-surveillance radar, additional Javelin short-range anti-tank rockets, artillery ammunition and helicopters. Russia has said the new military deliveries put Washington at risk of being directly involved in the conflict with Moscow. An adviser to the mayor of Mariupol has said that the shortage of drinking water has reached a critical level. Petro Andrushenko said people had to register to get drinking water and could only get it every two days. Basic infrastructure and services like water, gas and electricity are yet to be restored to the city after the prolonged siege from Russian forces as they tried to take it over. According to CNN, Andrushenko said: “The amount of water was small before, but now it has decreased altogether. It is necessary to register in the queue ... In the future, the temperature will rise, the water level will fall, and the water will be less.” He said that water being provided is “very conditional drinking water”, which needs boiling. He added that he feared illnesses could break out in the south-eastern city because of the amount of rubbish and dead bodies buried in shallow graves. “We expect cholera [or] any viral epidemic related to the gastrointestinal tract. As a result of unsanitary conditions, this can happen. The worst thing is that such a basic thing as dysentery in the current conditions and with the dysfunctional medical system, lack of drugs, lack of laboratories and everything we are used to, lack of vaccines in Mariupol ... Even dysentery can kill tens of thousands.” Away from the conflict, but linked to the invasion, Ukraine are due to kick off against Wales shortly for the right to play at this year’s men’s football World Cup in Qatar. Their recent playoff game against Scotland, which was won by Ukraine was originally due to take place in March, but was delayed by the war. My colleague Will Unwin will be bringing you live updates with kick-off a few minutes away. Earlier today, in his weekly address from St Peter’s Square at the Vatican, Pope Francis called for “real negotiations” to end the “increasingly dangerous” war. “I renew my appeal to the leaders of nations: please do not lead humanity to destruction,” the 85-year-old said. US congress member Victoria Spartz has been on a two-day visit to Chernihiv, northern Ukraine, being pictured with the governor of the region, Viacheslav Chaus. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the US started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the Russian state Tass news agency reported on Sunday. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over an important nuclear power plant. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, said Bruno Le Maire, the finance minister. Ukrainian police on Sunday shared video showing the aftermath of Russian shelling in the city of Lysychansk, in the Luhansk region. The video shows damaged administrative buildings, residential buildings and roads. Police said the headquarters for distributing humanitarian aid had been burned to the ground. They said more than 40 people had been living permanently in the building but no information on casualties was provided. Luke Harding and Isobel Koshiw in Bakhmut have the following dispatch from Ukraine: In eastern Ukraine there was intense fighting on Sunday all across the Donbas frontline. Ukrainian forces deployed their existing Smersh multiple launcher rocket system near the city of Bakhmut. Sepia streaks were visible in the sky as rockers were fired at Russian army positions. Another - or possibly the same - Smersh system was seen on Sunday morning on the road between Slavyansk and Bakhmut. Ukrainian army sources admitted their Smersh MLRS were older than the modernised version used by Russia, and had a range of just 40kms. There was no evidence this weekend that the advanced MLRS promised by the Biden administration had reached the eastern theatre. Armoured personnel carriers, ammunition trucks and ambulances could be seen on the roads, as well as battered civilian vehicles painted in military green. There was also a spectacular 220mm 2S7 heavy artillery piece, nicknamed Godzilla. It was mounted on a long lorry.Doctors in Bakhmut’s military hospital said the battle for the Donbas had become a grinding artillery war, seven weeks after Vladimir Putin abandoned his attempt to seize Kyiv. Most of the soldiers brought in for treatment were suffering from shrapnel wounds, they said, with relatively few bullet injuries. Outgoing artillery could be heard near continuously, as well as the odd burst of unexplained gunfire. Most of the city’s 100,000 residents have fled. The city is 10km from the frontline. Denis Babenko, a pastor turned soldier, now evacuating civilians, said morale on the Ukrainian side was high. “We have soul but we don’t have the arms. They have the arms but no spirit or motivation. To win this war we need more heavy weapons.” Ukraine’s gas transit system operator has said the volume of Russian gas nominations at Sudzha transit point has totalled 40.08 mcm for 6 June. More soon... Columns of smoke rise over Kyiv after airstrikes early on Sunday. Missiles hit eastern areas of the Ukrainian capital and injured at least one person, according to the city’s mayor, Vitaly Klitschko. Russia’s defence ministry said the strikes had targeted tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of the city. Ed Vulliamy has written a column about why he is supporting Ukraine in this year’s Fifa World Cup, despite his Welsh heritage. On Sunday evening, every football fan in the world – apart from the Welsh – will be joined by many others who do not even care for the game in rooting for the national team of battered and besieged but resilient Ukraine as they face Wales for a place in the World Cup in Qatar later this year. Watching here in St Davids, Pembrokeshire, even I, with a substantial quotient of Welsh DNA, will be wearing my official Ukraine yellow football shirt with “Malinovskyi 8” on the back. You can read the article here: Dan Sabbagh reports from Kyiv that Russia launched airstrikes into Kyiv for the first time in five weeks on Sunday, claiming it had destroyed western-supplied tanks – while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, warned more targets would be struck if weapons deliveries continued. Perhaps signalling the new approach, Putin told Rossiya state television that Russia would hit fresh targets in Ukraine if the US delivered the longer-range rockets that it had promised to Kyiv last week. If such missiles were supplied, “we will strike at those targets which we have not yet been hitting”, said Putin, who is believed to be closely involved in military decision-making. The Russian leader did not specify what would be struck, although logistics points would be amongst the most logical targets. Russia has been irritated by the US decision to supply Ukraine with Himars truck mounted multiple-launch rocket systems, with missiles that have a range of about 20 to 40 miles, greater than anything in Kyiv’s armoury. You can read more of the reporting below: Russia’s strike on Kyiv, Ukraine’s capital, has been the first attack in over a month on the city. Ukrainian officials have said that a counterattack in the east had retaken half of the city of Sievierodonetsk. Reuters reports: Dark smoke could be seen from many miles away after the attack on two outlying districts of Kyiv. Moscow said it had hit a repair shop housing tanks sent from eastern Europe. Ukraine said Russia had carried out the strike using long-range air-launched missiles fired from heavy bombers as far away as the Caspian Sea – a weapon far more valuable than the tanks Russia claimed to have hit. At least one person was hospitalised but there were no immediate reports of deaths from the strike - a sudden reminder of war in a capital where normal life has largely returned since Russian forces were driven from its outskirts in March. “The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal - kill as many as possible,” Ukrainian presidential adviser Mikhailo Podolyak wrote in a tweet. Ukraine’s nuclear power operator said a Russian cruise missile had flown “critically low” over the country’s second largest nuclear power plant. The attack was the first big strike on Kyiv since late April, when a missile killed a journalist. Recent weeks have seen Russia focus its destructive might mainly on frontlines in the east and south, although Moscow occasionally strikes elsewhere in what it calls a campaign to degrade Ukraine’s military infrastructure and block Western arms shipments. Matthew Cantor has spoken to Lee Zion, a journalist in Minnesota who plans to fly to Europe to help Ukrainians “in any way he can”. Lee Zion is preparing to head to Ukraine this summer. “I have gotten all my shots. I have started putting personal possessions into storage, giving other things away. I’ve adopted out two cats,” he said. “And minor things – I’m trying to learn the language. I can at least communicate some basic needs. Like ‘me want cookie,’” he said. For four years, Zion has worked seven days a week at a small-town Minnesota newspaper. But now, disgusted by the Russian invasion of Ukraine, he plans to fly to Europe and help the Ukrainians in any way he can.

Nato’s reluctance to seize the initiative, rather than passively reacting to Russian actions, is unfathomable, too. Proposals for a no-fly zone and safe havens in western Ukraine are repeatedly rejected as too risky. So dare to try something else! Nato has the muscle and means. It could do much more to stop the systematic killing of civilians and push Russia back, as previously argued here. Left to fight alone, Zelenskiy pleads for heavy weapons but his pleas still often go unmet or responses are delayed. “We need to get serious about supplying [Ukraine’s] army so that it can do what the world is asking it to do: fight a world superpower alone on the battlefield,” says US Gen Philip Breedlove, formerly Nato commander in Europe. He’s right. You can read more here: Russian strikes destroyed tanks and other armoured vehicles on the outskirts of Kyiv that had been provided to Ukraine by European countries, Russia’s defence ministry said on Sunday. The ministry’s statement came after the Ukrainian capital experienced by several explosions early on Sunday. Ukraine’s air force and the Kyiv mayor have said Russian Tu-95 strategic bombers launched missiles at Kyiv from the Caspian Sea early on Sunday and two of the Ukrainian capital’s eastern districts were rocked by explosions in an attack that targeted railway infrastructure in Kyiv. The mayor, Vitaly Klitschko said at least one person was taken to hospital; no deaths were immediately reported. Reuters reports: Dark smoke rose into the sky above the Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts where the explosions rang out. The missiles were the first to hit the capital since late April when a Radio Liberty producer was killed when a Russian missile hit the building she lived in. According to preliminary data, Russia launched missiles from Tu-95 aircraft from the Caspian Sea,” the Ukrainian air forces said in a statement. Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak called on the west to impose more sanctions on Russia to punish it for the strikes and to supply more weapons to Ukraine. The Kremlin resorts to new insidious attacks. Today*s missile strikes at Kyiv have only one goal: kill as many as possible,” he wrote. The mayor of the historic town of Brovary some 12 miles (12km) from Kyiv’s centre, urged people to remain inside their houses as there had been reports of the smell of soot coming from the smoke. President Vladimir Putin said Russia would strike new targets if the United States started supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles, the TASS news agency reported on Sunday.

utin did not name the targets Russia planned to pursue if western countries began supplying Ukraine with longer-range missiles. He said the “fuss” around western weapon supplies to Ukraine was designed to drag out the conflict. Ukraine has been seeking Multiple Rocket Launch Systems (MLRS) such as the M270 and M142 HIMARS to strike troops and weapons stockpiles at the Russian forces’ rear. France is in talks with the United Arab Emirates to replace Russian oil purchases, which will stop after the imposition of a European Union ban on Russian crude following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Sunday. “There are discussions with the United Arab Emirates. We have to find an alternative to Russian oil,” Le Maire told Europe 1 radio. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator Energoatom said a Russian cruise missile flew “critically low” on Sunday morning over a major nuclear power plant. Reuters, although they could not immediately verify the claim, reports: “It’s probable that was the missile that was fired in the direction of Kyiv,” the operator of the Pivdennoukrainska plant, also called the South Ukraine Nuclear Plant, said in a post on the Telegram messaging app. Early on Sunday, several explosions rocked Kyiv. Pivdennoukrainska is Ukraine’s second largest nuclear plant located near in the Mykolaiv region, about 350 km (220 miles) south of Kyiv. As of this morning, 262 children have been killed and 467 injured, according to the latest figures from Verkhovna Rada, the Ukrainian parliament. Those figures are not final, the parliament said on Telegram: Work is underway to establish them in places of active hostilities, in the temporarily occupied and liberated territories. The true number is likely significantly higher. In parts of Ukraine that are occupied or under active attack by Russia, local authorities have said it is impossible to clear bodies from the street, or count the numbers of citizens killed or injured. The parliament said 1938 schools or educational facilities had been damaged by bombing, and 182 were completely destroyed. Control of Sievierodonetsk is split in half between Ukrainian and Russian forces, Serhiy Gaidai, governor or the Luhansk region where the eastern city is located, said on Sunday. Reuters reports that Gaidai said on Ukrainian television: It had been a difficult situation, the Russians controlled 70% of the city, but over the past two days they have been pushed back.” “The city is now, more or less, divided in half.” Reuters could not immediately verify Gaidai’s claims. If you’d like a fuller report on fight for territory in Sievierodonetsk, here’s a report from our Ukraine-based correspondents: For a little more context on these strikes in Kyiv, they come after a period of relative calm in the city, after Moscow turned its military focus to the east and south. Politico’s Ukraine-based correspondent Christopher Miller said “It was eerily silent this morn, save for the birds. Then came the explosions in the distance.” He called it “the first attack on Kyiv in weeks”. An update on the explosions that shook Kyiv in the early hours of this morning - Mayor Vitali Klitschko has said that so far there have been no deaths reported. The mayor said on Telegram on Sunday morning: Friends! Regarding the morning explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital. There are currently no casualties from missile strikes on infrastructure. One victim was hospitalized. Services are still working in the affected areas This morning, Kyiv Regional Military Administration said that as well as the missiles that hit, one “enemy missile was shot down over Obukhiv district by air defense forces”. It asked residents to remain in shelters during air raids. Britain’s Ministry of Defence says Ukraine has counterattacked in the contested city of Sievierodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, “blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower”. The intelligence report backs up claims by Ukrainian officials on Saturday that their forces had recaptured parts of the city. The MoD said on Sunday morning: Over the last 24 hours, Ukrainian forces have counterattacked in the contested city of Sieverodonetsk in eastern Ukraine, likely blunting the operational momentum Russian forces previously gained through concentrating combat units and firepower. Several explosions shook the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Sunday, mayor Vitali Klitschko said. “Several explosions in Darnytskyi and Dniprovskyi districts of the capital,” Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app. “Services are already working on site. More detailed information - later.” A Reuters witness saw smoke in the city after the explosions. Air raid sirens had gone off earlier across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region Hello and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up, or just dropping in to find the latest information, here’s a summary of the main points of the past few hours. Powerful explosions were heard early on Sunday in Kyiv, a Reuters witness said. Smoke was seen in the Ukrainian capital following the explosions. Earlier, air raid sirens were going off across much of Ukraine, including in the Kyiv region. Ukrainian forces have been managing to push back against Russian troops in fierce fighting in Sievierodonetsk despite Moscow “throwing all its power” into capturing the key eastern city, Ukrainian officials said on Saturday. In an interview aired online, the Luhansk regional governor, Sergiy Gaiday, said the Russian army has taken control over most of Sievierodonetsk, but that Ukrainian forces were still pushing them back. But the Russian army claimed some Ukrainian military units have been withdrawing from Sievierodonetsk. “Some units of the Ukrainian army, having suffered critical losses during fighting for Sievierodonetsk, are pulling out towards Lysychansk”, Sievierodonetsk’s twin city, which sits just across a river, the defence ministry said in a statement. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said Moscow’s anti-aircraft forces have shot down dozens of Ukrainian weapons and are “cracking them like nuts”, in an interview that aired on Saturday. According to Reuters, Russian news agency RIA, which first cited the comments, quoted Putin as responding to a question about US-supplied arms by saying Russia was coping easily and had already destroyed the weapons by the dozen. Kyiv has rebuked the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for saying it was important not to “humiliate Russia”. The Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, tweeted in response: “Calls to avoid humiliation of Russia can only humiliate France and every other country that would call for it. Because it is Russia that humiliates itself. We all better focus on how to put Russia in its place. This will bring peace and save lives.” Western sanctions would not have an effect on Russia’s oil exports, the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said. Lavrov also predicted a significant increase in profits from energy shipments this year, Russian news agency Tass reported. A EU decision to extend sanctions against Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko to his wife is “irrational” because she has never held Russian citizenship or resided in Russia, a representative for the couple said. The EU sanctioned Melnichenko’s wife on Friday as part of a sixth round of sanctions against Russia for waging a war against Ukraine. Negotiations with Russia will only resume after new weapons arrive from the west and Ukraine’s position is “strengthened”, said David Arakhamia, a member of Ukraine’s negotiation group with Russia. Another negotiator, Mykhailo Podolyak, said there was no point in talks with Russia until Moscow’s forces are pushed back as far as possible towards Ukraine’s borders. Ukraine’s intelligence services are in communication with hundreds of captured Azovstal steelworks fighters and Kyiv is doing all it can to ensure their release, according to Ukraine’s interior minister, Denys Monastyrskiy. Ukraine wants the fighters to be returned in a prisoner swap. However, some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed. The US expressed support for international investigations into war crimes committed in Ukraine, the US embassy in Kyiv announced. “Those responsible for war crimes – including direct perpetrators and those who ordered them – must face justice,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday. A famous monastery in eastern Ukraine, Svyatohirsk Lavra, caught fire after it was hit by Russian shelling. The monastery is affiliated with the Moscow Patriarchate, which is run by Putin’s ally Patriarch Kirill. There were reports that four monks were killed as a result of the attack . The Ukrainian first lady, Olena Zelenska, and other officials commemorated 261 children killed by the Russian war against Ukraine by hanging bells near St Sophia Cathedral in Kyiv. The bells symbolise the voices of killed children," Euromaidan Press reported.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK visa delays cause J Balvin to cancel Ed Sheeran sessions,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/13/j-balvin-uk-visa-delays-backlog-cancel-ed-sheeran-sessions,2022-05-13T16:14:24Z,"Colombian reggaeton star is latest to be hit by backlog in immigration system, made worse by Ukraine war","The hit Colombian singer J Balvin had to abandon recording sessions and filming in London with Ed Sheeran last month because his visa never arrived. The reggaeton star, who has sold 35m records worldwide, is the latest musician to be caught out by long delays at UK visas and immigration. Agents and tour managers are having to cancel British performances because visas for performers that used to be turned around within a fortnight are now taking up to two months. Balvin applied in March for a visa as he was meant to be in Britain from 3 to 8 April, for recording sessions with Sheeran at Abbey Road and a video shoot. When the visa had still not arrived by 12 April, he withdrew the application. Balvin has been waiting a fortnight for a new visa to try again to shoot a video with Sheeran. He is also hoping to perform in the UK. It has not been possible to pay for priority fast-tracking of visas since March, according to those working in the industry. It is understood to be because of a chronic backlog made worse by an influx of Ukrainian applications. Balvin, whose full name is José Álvaro Osorio Balvín, has already collaborated with Sheeran. Their joint EP with songs Forever My Love and Sigue was released in March. Steve Richard, director of T&amp;S Immigration Services, who has been working on Balvin’s application, said: “We’ve explained to the management company that the visa system is essentially in crisis and it’s mainly because of the Ukraine situation. “It’s been going on for a while now and you would have hoped that it would have been getting there, but it’s just slipping and slipping. We haven’t heard of anybody getting a visa in less than six weeks in quite a while now.” Richard added: “It’s taking artists by surprise – they’re not used to waiting over six weeks for visas and they are being caught out. I can see visa-heavy festivals – those which feature many acts from Africa and Asia, for instance – being impacted worst by this, unless the UKVI [UK Visas and Immigration] is able to throw more staff at the visa section.” While international musicians from places such as the US or the EU only require work permits, performers from many Asian, South American and African countries need visas. The Congolese band Fulu Miziki Kollektiv, who perform using instruments made from rubbish, are meant to be starting a UK tour next week. They applied for visas on 7 April and with no news they are wondering if they will have to cancel performances. Deboul, a singer in the band, said: “This is all our dreams being taken away, everything we’ve worked for. We always dream of being able to have a stage, to share our message, but for some reason, we still can’t get that, just because there are these visa issues. “It somehow feels like there’s a world they don’t want us to be part of, even if we have what it takes, we are invited to play, we have everything they ask for, and we still don’t have any answer.” Circus Raj, a group of five circus performers, and the Rajasthan Heritage Brass Band were supposed to arrive from Jaipur last Thursday to begin a tour of British festivals. Music agent Graham Breakwell applied for their visas at the start of March but only one dancer and a fakir from the circus was given a visa and only two of the six brass band members. Their first performance is due on Saturday in the Coventry city of culture finale celebrations. “We’ve got one tuba player and one clarinettist,” Breakwell said. “It’s crazy, you can’t work with that.” For the Coventry performances, he has made up the brass band with performers from Bradford and the circus act will be missing slack rope walking, acrobats and contortionists. Both acts are due to perform at Glastonbury next month and Breakwell is concerned. “We will have to cancel shows if we still haven’t received their visas. The knock-on effects are clearly very serious for everyone in the industry.” A Home Office spokesperson said: “We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by Putin’s barbaric invasion of Ukraine, so applications for study, work and family visas have taken longer to process. “We are working at pace to ensure these are issued as quickly as possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zelenskiy says Putin is the only Russian official he is willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/23/russia-ukraine-war-up-to-100-ukrainians-dying-every-day-in-east-zelenskiy-says-war-to-dominate-davos-meeting-live,2022-05-23T23:59:06Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said President Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. “The president of the Russian Federation decides it all,” he said in a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelenskiy said. “I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president.” A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers are due to face war crimes trials, she said, adding that Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages and agreed to send more advanced weapons to Ukraine, including a harpoon launcher and missiles to protect its coast, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on Monday. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Denmark pledged to send Harpoon anti-ship missiles that could be used to push the Russian navy away from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, allowing exports of grain and other agricultural products to resume. “Low-level” discussions are reportedly underway on whether some US troops should be based in Ukraine and how the US may need to adjust its training of Ukrainian forces, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days” and may require capping global oil prices, Germany’s economy minister said on Monday. “We will reach a breakthrough within days,” Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF, adding that the European Commission and the United States were working on a proposal to no longer pay “any price” for oil, but to cap global prices. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. The war in Ukraine could cause a recession in weaker economies, the head of the IMF has warned. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain, according to a series of images released by Maxar Technologies, seemingly backing up claims from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country, CNN has reported. In the photos, taken from 19 and 21 May, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business in the country for the Seattle-based coffee company. Starbucks currently has 130 stores in Russia and the company employs nearly 2,000 people in the country. McDonalds has also removed the “golden arches” from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that President Vladimir Putin was the only Russian official he was willing to meet with to discuss how to end the war. In a video address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Zelenskiy said: The president of the Russian Federation decides it all. If we are talking about ending this war without him personally, that decision cannot be taken. I cannot accept any kind of meeting with anyone coming from the Russian Federation but the president. And only in the case when there is one issue on the (table): stopping the war. There are no other grounds for any other kind of meeting.” Zelenskiy added that arranging any talks with Russia was becoming more difficult in light of what he said was evidence of Russian actions against civilians under occupation. Russia’s foreign minister has said Moscow will focus on developing relations with China, though would consider offers from the west to re-establish ties. Sergei Lavrov, in a question and answer session at an event in Moscow, said western countries had espoused “russophobia” since Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. Russia was working to replace goods imported from western countries, he said, and in future, would rely only on “reliable” countries not beholden to the west. If they (the west) want to offer something in terms of resuming relations, then we will seriously consider whether we will need it or not,” Lavrov said, according to a transcript on the foreign ministry’s website. Lavrov set down grievances with western countries that he said were determined to change the rules of international relations to Russia’s detriment. We must cease being dependent in any way on supplies of absolutely everything from the West for ensuring the development of critically important sectors for security, the economy or our homeland’s social sphere,” he said. Lavrov said Moscow’s goal now is to further develop ties with China. Now that the west has taken a ‘dictator’s position’, our economic ties with China will grow even faster. In addition to direct revenue for the state budget, this is a chance to develop (Russia’s) far east and eastern Siberia.” China, he said, had information and communications technologies “that are in no way inferior to the west. A great deal here will ensure mutual benefits.” Lavrov said Russia would count on “only ourselves and on countries which have proved themselves reliable and do not ‘dance to some other piper’s music’. If western countries change their minds and propose some form of cooperation, we can then decide.” The European Union will likely agree an embargo on Russian oil imports “within days,” Germany’s economy minister said on Monday, but making a dent in Russia’s war chest may require capping global oil prices. “We will reach a breakthrough within days,” Robert Habeck told German broadcaster ZDF when asked about an EU oil embargo in retaliation for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. He warned, however, that an embargo would not automatically weaken the Kremlin. Rising global oil prices after the United States announced an embargo on Russian oil enabled it to rake in more income while selling lower volumes. Therefore, the European Commission and United States were working on a proposal to no longer pay “any price” for oil, but to cap global prices, he said. “It is obviously an unusual measure, but these are unusual times,” he said. “This path only works if many countries get on board... and that’s proving to be the sticking point.” The United States is still “a ways away” from any possible decision on whether to re-introduce US troops into Ukraine, General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters on Monday, though acknowledged low-level planning underway. President Joe Biden decided to withdraw American troops from Ukraine before Russia’s 24 February invasion in order to avoid a direct conflict with a nuclear-armed adversary. But changing circumstances including a reopening of the US embassy have raised questions about whether US troops may be required to return to help ensure security of diplomats in a country at war. At a news conference, Milley acknowledged some degree of staff planning ahead of a potential decision to send US troops back into Ukraine. That planning hasn’t made it to his level for review or to the level of US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin where ultimately, it would be up to Biden. At the end of the day, any reintroduction of US forces into Ukraine would require a presidential decision. So we’re a ways away from anything like that. We’re still developing courses of action, and none of that’s been presented yet to the Secretary.” Milley did not specify whether he was referring to low-level planning for US troops to potentially secure a US diplomatic presence in Ukraine or potentially for other activities as well. Russia’s Roscosmos space agency director general, Dmitry Rogozin, has said the Kuril Islands, a subject of territorial dispute with Japan, could be renamed after Russian ships and events of the early 20th century’s Russo-Japanese war, according to a Reuters report. The territorial dispute over the isles – which Russia says are part of its Kuril chain and which Japan calls its northern territories – has prevented Tokyo and Moscow from reaching a peace treaty formally ending second world war hostilities. Rogozin proposed to change the name of one of the islands to Varyag in honour of a cruiser whose sinking started the Russo-Japanese war in 1904. He also proposed that the Habomai Islands could be called the archipelago of Russian hero sailors. “Always, when states added territories they would give them their own names (... ) Why don’t these islands have Russian names?” Rogozin said on state-owned radio broadcaster Sputnik. “This would be much more logical than the names with which we now have been calling these islands and which destroy the Russian language.” A recording of Russian diplomat to the United Nations in Geneva, Boris Bondarev, has emerged after the official resigned from his position. Bondarev said he had handed in his resignation before sending a scathing letter to foreign colleagues inveighing against the “aggressive war unleashed” by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in Ukraine. Bondarev, 41, confirmed his resignation in a letter posted on his Facebook page. “For 20 years of my diplomatic career, I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on 24 February of this year,” he wrote, alluding to the date of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It is just after 1am in Kyiv. Here are the updates going into Tuesday morning: Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia, commended Boris Bondarev’s decision to resign and encouraged other Russian officials to do the same. The war in Ukraine has impacted the global economy and could lead to recessions in vulnerable countries, according to the head of International Monetary Fund. After months of providing shelter to residents, the subway system in Kharkiv will begin operating again this week. McDonalds has removed the “golden arches” from Moscow as the company prepares to leave Russia for good. Satellite images reportedly show Russian-flagged ships stealing grain from Ukraine, as officials warn of a food crisis that could be felt around the world. New satellite images reportedly show Russian theft of Ukrainian grain, CNN reports, backing up claims from Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy that food had been gradually stolen from the country. The images, which were produced by Maxar Technologies, are from 19 and 21 May. In them, two bulk carrier ships with Russian flags can be seen loading grain from the grain silos they are docked by. From CNN: It’s difficult to know for certain whether the ship is being loaded with stolen Ukrainian grain, but Russia-annexed Crimea produces little grain itself, unlike the agriculturally rich Ukrainian regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia immediately to the north. Ukrainian officials and industry sources have told CNN that Russian forces in occupied areas have emptied several silos and trucked the grain south. Earlier this month, the Matros Pozynich carried out a similar mission: loading up with grain and setting sail out of the Black Sea and into the Mediterranean. It was initially bound for Egypt with its cargo, but it was turned away from Alexandria after a warning from Ukrainian officials, according to the country’s government. It was also barred entry to Beirut, eventually docking in Latakia, in Syria, where Russia has for years been propping up the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Meanwhile, Russia has stopped Ukrainian exports from the ports, creating the potential for a global food crisis. With Ukraine a top exporter of wheat and other food products, supply is already becoming strained. “The world community must help Ukraine unblock seaports, otherwise the energy crisis will be followed by a food crisis and many more countries will face it,” Zelenskiy said over the weekend. McDonald’s world-famous golden arches are coming down in Moscow, Reuters reports, as the fast food chain begins its departure from Russia. After more than three decades, the company is selling the restaurants to a local licensee and they will operate under a different name. From Reuters: McDonald’s had in March decided to close its restaurants in the country, including the Pushkin Square location in central Moscow that had been a symbol of flourishing American capitalism in the dying embers of the Soviet Union. The departure of McDonald’s is one of the most high-profile so far in opposition to what Russia calls its special operation in neighboring Ukraine.” McDonald’s opened its first restaurant in Moscow in 1990, a move largely seen as a signal just one year before the Soviet Union collapsed. But in March, the company announced that, because of the invasion of Ukraine and the “humanitarian crisis” it caused, its outlets there would close. “This is a complicated issue that’s without precedent and with profound consequences,” said McDonald’s chief executive, Chris Kempczinski, in a statement to staff, reported by the BBC. The departure comes at a high cost, and the company will write off a $1.4bn charge while also covering pay for the 62,000 employees now out of work, until the newly branded restaurants reopen. “Some might argue that providing access to food and continuing to employ tens of thousands of ordinary citizens is surely the right thing to do,” Kempczinski said. “But it is impossible to ignore the humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. And it is impossible to imagine the Golden Arches representing the same hope and promise that led us to enter the Russian market 32 years ago.” The mayor of Kharkiv has announced that the city will resume subway service this week after the underground system was used for months to shelter civilians, CNN reports. “All lines will be launched,” the mayor, Ihor Terekhov, said in a televised address, noting that the trains won’t go as often as they did before the invasion. “The subway depot was damaged during the bombing and shelling, so the intervals will be longer.” Residents in the county’s second-largest city fled to the tracks as Russia attacked in February, but officials said those who sought refuge have now been relocated. Still, if needed, Terekhov said, “people can use the subway as a bomb shelter, especially subway underpasses”. The award-winning Ukrainian film-maker Sergei Loznitsa said he plans to make a documentary about the war in his country. Loznitsa, who lives in Lithuania, is currently showing his latest film, The Natural History of Destruction, at the Cannes film festival. The filmmaker told Reuters today: I haven’t yet been back in Ukraine since the war started but of course I intend to go there, and I intend to make a film, about those atrocities that are taking place at the moment. Loznitsa also defended his position that Russian film-makers should not be boycotted in response to the war in Ukraine: Culture in general, by definition, opposes war – it is something that is absolutely against any war. And I’m now handing over the blog to my Guardian US colleague Gabrielle Canon. She will have more updates coming up, so stay tuned. A Ukrainian court has demanded the arrest in absentia of the country’s former president Viktor Yanukovych on charges of treason. The accusations center on a 2010 pact signed by Yanukovych that extended Russia’s lease on naval facilities in Crimea. That agreement, widely known in Ukraine as the Kharkiv pact, allowed Russia to keep its Black Sea Fleet in the Crimean port of Sevastopol, Reuters reports. Yanukovych has already received a 13-year jail sentence in absentia for treason, in connection to a letter he sent to Vladimir Putin in 2014. The letter asked the Russian leader to use his country’s army and police forces to restore order in Ukraine. Yanukovych fled to Russia in 2014 following mass protests. The foreign minister of Lithuania, Gabrielius Landsbergis, praised the joint declaration signed by his country and Britain today to reaffirm their support for Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression. “A great meeting with a true friend Liz Truss,” Landsbergis said of his discussion with the British foreign secretary. “Full agreement on the need to help Ukraine to achieve a complete victory. Covered the food crisis caused by Russian blockade of Odessa and the need to boost the security of Nato’s eastern flank, [including] forward defence in the Baltics.” In a statement released earlier today, Truss said of the declaration: The UK and Lithuania are two countries which believe in freedom and sovereignty, and who stand up to authoritarian regimes in Europe and across the world. We stand together with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal, barbaric war. The Guardian’s Larry Elliott and Graeme Wearden in Davos report: The head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said the war in Ukraine has darkened the outlook for the global economy and could result in recession for more vulnerable countries. Kristalina Georgieva predicted that 2022 would be a tough year and declined to rule out a global recession if conditions worsened markedly. Asked in a session on the world economy at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, whether the IMF was forecasting a global recession, Georgieva replied: “Not at this point. It doesn’t mean one is out of the question.” The IMF managing director said her organisation had recently downgraded the growth prospects for 143 of its member states, which represent 80% of global output. “Since then the horizon has darkened,” she said, pointing out that the impact of the war in Ukraine was being amplified by a tightening of financial conditions, a rising US dollar and a slowdown in China. “2022 is going to be a tough year.” Read the Guardian’s full report: Starbucks is leaving the Russian market, bringing an end to nearly 15 years of business in the country for the Seattle-based coffee company. Starbucks currently has 130 stores in Russia, according to Reuters, and the company employs nearly 2,000 people in the country. Despite exiting the market, Starbucks said it would continue to support its Russian employees by paying them for six months. The move comes amid a wave of announcements from western companies that they are leaving the Russian market by selling off assets or transferring them to local managers in response to the war in Ukraine. McDonald’s said last week that it would sell its restaurants in Russia to its local licensee and have them rebranded under a new name, but the company will retain its trademarks. The former US ambassador to Russia, Michael McFaul, has applauded Boris Bondarev over his decision to resign as a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva. “Bravo Boris Bondarev! I know that many other Russian officials share your views. Hope they will now have the courage to follow your lead,” McFaul said on Twitter. Bondarev, a 20-year veteran of the Russian foreign ministry, said he was “ashamed” of his country after witnessing the atrocities carried out in Ukraine over the past few months. “Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy,” Bondarev said in a public statement. “It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy.” It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: A veteran Russian diplomat in Geneva has resigned over his country’s invasion of Ukraine, in a rare political protest from within the Russian foreign policy establishment. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor at the Russian permanent mission to the United Nations in Geneva, wrote in a public statement: “Never have I been so ashamed of my country.” He confirmed he had submitted his letter of resignation. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Another 48 Russian soldiers are due to face war crimes trials, she said, adding that Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes. The US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said 20 countries announced new security assistance packages for Ukraine during a meeting with allies aimed at coordinating arms for Kyiv. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Ukrainian forces will continue to fight even if they are surrounded by Russian forces in the Donbas region, western officials said. They said while Russians would eventually succeed in encircling the “Severodonetsk pocket”, that did not necessarily spell defeat for the Ukrainians, adding: “The Ukrainians don’t want to give up any territory. They want to make the Russians fight for every bit of it.” Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, Zelenskiy called for a full oil embargo, the severing of Russian banks from the global financial system, the complete isolation of the Russian IT sector and a ban on trade with Russia. Zelenskiy gave an insight into the level of losses being sustained by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian airstrike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike, which took place last Tuesday. Zelenskiy’s figure would give the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far. The Ukrainian fighters who surrendered at the Azovstal steelworks in the port city of Mariupol are to be put on trial, the head of the separatist Donetsk region, Denis Pushilin, told Russian state media. It was not clear what charges the soldiers would face. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Joan Greve. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Lithuania will withdraw its ambassador to Russia from 1 June, according to a presidential decree. No replacement has been named, Reuters reports. On 4 April the Lithuanian foreign ministry said it was expelling the Russian ambassador after Ukraine accused Russian forces of killing civilians in the town of Bucha. Russia’s ambassador to Lithuania “will have to leave the country”, the Lithuanian foreign ministry said in a statement at the time. It said it intended to lower the level of diplomatic representation between the two countries. Ukrainian forces will continue to fight even if they are surrounded by Russian forces in the Donbas region, western officials said. Russian troops have focused their efforts on cutting off the Ukrainians who have been dug in around the strategically important city of Severodonetsk. Western officials said that while Russians would eventually succeed in encircling the “Severodonetsk pocket”, that did not necessarily spell defeat for the Ukrainians. One official said that even if no more aid was able to get through, the Ukrainians had shown they were willing to carry on fighting, inflicting further damage on the Russian military machine. They said: I think this largely comes down to political will. The Ukrainians don’t want to give up any territory. They want to make the Russians fight for very bit of it. By continuing to fight, these Ukrainian troops would fulfil an important military function by “degrading the Russian capability to advance and creating time for the Ukrainian forces to continue to improve their defences elsewhere”, the official said. They added: From a loss of life position escaping might be desirable. but from a military point of view and a political point of view the Ukrainians will intend to fight. We would expect them to fight for every bit of territory they can. Twenty countries announced new security assistance packages for Ukraine during a meeting with allies aimed at coordinating arms for Kyiv, the US secretary of defence, Lloyd Austin, said. Among the countries that announced new packages were Italy, Denmark, Greece, Norway and Poland, Austin said at a news conference at the conclusion of the virtual meeting. The new security packages included “donating critically needed artillery ammunition, coastal defence systems and tanks and other armoured vehicles”, he said. Denmark agreed to provide a harpoon launcher and missiles to “help Ukraine defend its coast”, he said. The Czech Republic agreed to send “substantial support” to Kyiv including “a recent donation of attack helicopters, tanks and rocket systems,” he added. Other countries came forward “with new commitments for training Ukraine’s forces and sustaining its military systems”, he said. Austin said: Everyone here understands the stakes of this war. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, said there were about 13,000 cases of Russian alleged war crimes being investigated as of Monday. Speaking at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Venediktova said 48 more Russian soldiers would face war crimes trials, after a Kyiv court sentenced Vadim Shishimarin to life in prison for the killing of a 62-year-old unarmed civilian, Oleksandr Shelipov. Venediktova said: We have already initiated close to 13,000 cases which are connected only to war crimes. In this category, suspicions were reported [about] 49 individuals, which we started to prosecute [for] war crimes. Ukrainian officials have a list of about 600 suspects thought to have engaged in war crimes, she said, while two cases involving three individuals were already being held by courts. Venediktova said the scale of complaints against Russia suggested a systemic tolerance or encouragement of war crimes against Ukrainians, adding: All evidence indicates that the Russian military and political elite has unconditionally reverted to the brutal war tactics of violence. Civilian populations and civilian objects – including hospitals, educational facilities, and residential buildings – are internationally targeted in a widespread and systematic manner. She said violations by Russian forces that her team had documented amounted to “unspeakable deliberate cruelty and violence against civilians”, adding: This is particularly apparent in territories that were on the frontlines of war, which practically became a slaughterhouse. She said 4,600 civilians were known to have died as a result of the war, including 232 children, and the real number was likely to be higher. The US is considering sending special operations forces to Ukraine to guard its embassy in Kyiv, according to US officials. The Biden administration is in the early stages of discussions about sending forces into the Ukrainian capital and a proposal has not been presented to the president for a decision, CNN reports. The Wall Street Journal first reported that US military and diplomatic officials were weighing up plans to send troops to Kyiv to guard the newly reopened embassy there. Currently, the embassy and its limited number of personnel are being protected by US state department diplomatic security officials. US marines typically guard embassies but there has been a general agreement that they may not be suited to the uncertain security situation in Ukraine, officials told CNN. The US does not believe Russia would overtly attack its embassy but there is concern that it could inadvertently target the compound and the situation could dramatically escalate, officials said. A Russian diplomat who resigned over the war in Ukraine said he does not believe his feelings are shared by many of his former colleagues in the foreign ministry. Boris Bondarev, Russia’s counsellor to the UN in Geneva, wrote in a statement that he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and criticised the Russian foreign ministry for its increasing “level of lies and unprofessionalism”. The statement was published by the UN rights watchdog, UN Watch. Bondarev later explained to the BBC why he had chosen to defect: The reason is that I strongly disagree and disapprove of what my government is doing and has been doing at least since February, and I don’t want to be associated with that any longer. He said it was a case of when, not if, he was going to quit. “I don’t see any alternative.” He said he did not believe that his feelings were widespread in the foreign ministry, but he hoped his decision to leave “may be one little brick into the bigger wall which would eventually be built”, adding: I think most people, the majority of them, are following the propaganda and what their superiors tell them. When you work in the ministry you work in a hierarchy, so you must obey what your superior tells you. And for many years any critical approach has been erased from the ministry mostly. Asked if he believed he would be considered a traitor, he replied: I think they are already considering me as such. Bondarev also spoke to Reuters about his ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ecision to leave the post, saying he had started to think about leaving “a few years ago but the scale of this disaster drove me to do it”. He said: I went to the mission like any other Monday morning and I forwarded my resignation letter and I walked out. He said had raised his concerns about the Russian invasion of Ukraine with senior embassy staff several times, and was “told to keep my mouth shut in order to avoid ramifications”. It is 6.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has urged the west to intensify its economic sanctions against Russia as he said business leaders in Davos needed to decide whether “brute force” should rule the world.

Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he had not meant to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, criticised those who conceived of the war for “enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity”. He later confirmed he has left his post. The Belarusian president and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, said he was concerned about what he called moves by the west to “dismember” Ukraine. During a televised meeting with the Russian president, Lukashenko also accused Poland of seeking to seize the western part of Ukraine. He provided no evidence to support either of his claims. Britain and Lithuania have signed a joint declaration that will look to build on bilateral defence and trade ties, the UK Foreign Office said. The declaration will build on the defence cooperation the two countries share as Nato allies and will increase resistance to threats, including from Russia and China, the UK government said. Good afternoon from London. It’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Belarusian president and close ally of Vladimir Putin, Alexander Lukashenko, said he was concerned about what he called moves by the West to “dismember” Ukraine. During a televised meeting with Putin, Lukashenko also accused Poland of seeking to seize the Western part of Ukraine. He provided no evidence to support either of his claims. Lukashenko said: What worries us is that they are ready, the Poles and Nato, to come out, to help take western Ukraine like it was before 1939. Russia has previously suggested that Poland wants to establish control over historical Polish lands in Ukraine, a claim that Warsaw denies as disinformation, Reuters reports. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow was looking at an Italian peace plan proposal to end the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking to reporters in comments carried by Russian news agencies and reported by AFP, Rudenko said: We have received it recently and are studying it. He said discussions had not taken place between Russia and Italy, adding that Russia would comment at a later stage. Britain and Lithuania have signed a joint declaration that will look to build on bilateral defence and trade ties, the UK Foreign Office said. In a statement, the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said: The UK and Lithuania are two countries which believe in freedom and sovereignty, and who stand up to authoritarian regimes in Europe and across the world. We stand together with Ukraine in the face of Russia’s illegal, barbaric war. Lithuania shares a border with Belarus, whose president, Alexander Lukashenko, has forged a close relationship with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin. The declaration will build on the defence cooperation the two countries share as Nato allies and will increase resistance to threats, including from Russia and China, the British government said. Germany is to relax visa requirements for skilled workers from Russia, just as the country’s domestic intelligence agency warned of a heightened risk that Russian nationals working for German firms could be recruited for industrial espionage. Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is streamlining the visa application process by exempting Russian workers with specialised expertise in areas such as IT and communication technology from case-by-case assessments through the federal employment department. The so-called “global approval for access to the labour market”, which applies only to Russian employees of German companies who are earning at least €43,992 a year, will last until 30 September. Between the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of May, Germany issued more than 600 visas for Russian skilled workers, which allow for a longer stay in Germany than the 90-day so-called Schengen visa. The German foreign office told the news agency dpa it had issued about 350 work visas via its Moscow embassy in April, in addition to a further 190 working visas issued by the general consulate in St Petersburg. Most of those in receipt of such visas were already working for German firms, dpa said. Germany is already home to about 235,000 Russian passport holders, more than any other country in the European Union. Only last week, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution issued a special warning that Russian nationals who were about to move to Germany, and those already working in the country, faced an increased risk of being blackmailed or otherwise put under pressure to collect information of use to a Russian economy increasingly cut off from global knowledge networks. In a keynote video address to the World Economic Forum, the Ukrainian president has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia, including a full oil embargo, exclusion of its banks from global systems, an ‘abandonment’ of its IT sector, and a complete cessation of trade. Here is a clip from Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s presentation: Ukrainians have been out in some cities enthusiastically buying commemorative stamps again. Here are some of the latest pictures from Lviv that we have been sent over the newswires. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, has confirmed to Reuters that he has left his post on account of the war on Ukraine. [see 12.58] He has told the news agency: I went to the mission like any other Monday morning and I forwarded my resignation letter and I walked out. I started to imagine this a few years ago but the scale of this disaster drove me to do it. He told Reuters that he had raised his concerns about the invasion of Ukraine with senior embassy staff several times. “I was told to keep my mouth shut in order to avoid ramifications,” he said. There has been no official comment yet from Russia on Bondarev’s departure. Belarus’s army has begun checking its weaponry and logistics equipment to make sure they are combat-ready, its ministry of defence said, Reuters reports. In a statement, it said the army was carrying out checks on equipment in long-term storage. “The inspection will determine the condition of the equipment and its readiness to carry out its tasks,” it said. Russian troops were stationed in Belarus, which is to the north of Ukraine, for military exercises prior to using it as a launchpad for incursions towards Kyiv at the beginning of the 2022 invasion. Lithuania, Slovakia, Latvia and Estonia will call for the confiscation of Russian assets frozen by the EU to fund the rebuilding of Ukraine, in a joint letter by the four countries seen by Reuters. The letter, which will be presented to EU finance ministers tomorrow, reads: A substantial part of costs of rebuilding Ukraine, including compensation for victims of the Russian military aggression, must be covered by Russia. It also calls for the EU to start preparing new sanctions against Russia, adding: Ultimately, if Russia does not stop the military aggression against Ukraine, there should be no economic ties remaining between EU and Russia at all – ensuring that none of our financial resources, products or services contributes to Russia’s war machine. The four countries call for legal ways to be identified to “maximise” the use of assets frozen by the EU to cover “the costs of Ukraine’s continued efforts to withstand the Russian aggression, and for the post-war reconstruction of the country”. Last week, the European Commission said it would check if it was possible to seize frozen Russian assets to finance Ukraine under national and EU laws. EU officials have warned that the confiscation of assets could be legally difficult. The letter continues: In cases where legal ways to confiscate the assets will not be identified, it should be used as leverage and released only once Russia compensates Ukraine for all the damages done. Lithuania has called for a naval coalition “of the willing” to lift the Russian Black Sea blockade on Ukrainian grain exports. The Lithuanian foreign minister, Gabrielius Landsbergis, proposed the plan during talks with the UK foreign secretary, Liz Truss, on Monday in London. “Time is very, very short. We are closing in on a new harvest and there is no other practical way of exporting the grain except through the Black Sea port of Odesa,” he told the Guardian. There is no way of storing this grain and no other adequate alternative route. It is imperative that we show vulnerable countries we are prepared to take the steps that are needed to feed the world. Landsbergis proposed that a naval escort operation – not run by Nato – could protect the grain ships as they headed through the Black Sea and past Russian warships. He suggested that, apart from Britain, countries that were affected by the potential loss of grain such as Egypt could provide the necessary protection. What we have seen now is just the beginning. The worst is yet to come in the next five to seven weeks when the first harvest arrives and there is no place to put it, so that means people in northern Africa, the Middle East and south-east Asia will be paying exorbitant prices for wheat, corn and the other commodities they need to put food on their table. He said Ukraine needed to export 80m tonnes of wheat alone this year and the only option was through Odesa, the last Black Sea port held by Ukraine. His plan, under gestation for weeks, would require de-mining parts of the Black Sea to ensure safe passage, as well as the agreement of Turkey, which guards the entrance to the Black Sea. “This would be a non-military humanitarian mission and is not comparable with a no-fly zone,” he said. In this endeavour military ships or planes or both would be used to ensure that the grain supplies can leave Odesa safely and reach the Bosphorus without Russian interference. We would need a coalition of the willing – countries with significant naval power to protect the shipping lanes, and countries that are affected by this. Nato as an alliance should not take a role, he said. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned of “a hurricane of hunger” if Ukrainian grain is not exported. The world’s 41 least-developed nations import a third of their wheat from Ukraine and Russia. Soaring food prices have already driven inflation levels in Egypt to the highest level since mid-2019. Nearly 90 people were killed in a Russian air strike on the village of Desna in the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, according to Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The attack, which took place last Tuesday, left 87 people dead, Zelenskiy said during his address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Zelenskiy said: Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna under the rubble there were 87 casualties. 87 corpses. It has not been able to independently verify this figure. Last week, Ukrainian authorities said eight people were killed in the strike. Zelenskiy’s figure would make the Desna attack Ukraine’s biggest military death toll in a single strike of the war so far, Reuters reports. On the day of the attack, a Russian military spokesperson said high-precision, long-range missiles had hit Ukrainian reserves forces at a training centre near Desna and at one other site. A Russian diplomat has resigned from his position in the United Nations, saying he has “never been so ashamed” of his country and condemning Vladimir Putin for his “aggressive war” against Ukraine, according to reports. Boris Bondarev, a counsellor of the Russian mission to the UN office in Geneva, criticised the Russian foreign ministry – where he has worked for 20 years – for its increasing “level of lies and unprofessionalism”, the rights watchdog UN Watch reports. In a statement shared by the organisation’s director, Hillel Neuer, Bondarev said: For twenty years of my diplomatic career I have seen different turns of our foreign policy, but never have I been so ashamed of my country as on February 24 of this year. The aggressive war unleashed by Putin against Ukraine, and in fact against the entire Western world, is not only a crime against the Ukrainian people, but also, perhaps, the most serious crime against the people of Russia, with a bold letter Z crossing our all hopes and prospects for a prosperous free society in our country. Those who conceived this war want only one thing – to remain in power forever, live in pompous tasteless palaces, sail on yachts comparable in tonnage and cost to the entire Russian Navy, enjoying unlimited power and complete impunity. To achieve that they are willing to sacrifice as many lives as it takes. Thousands of Russians and Ukrainians have already died just for this. He said the work of the foreign ministry had become “simply catastrophic” in recent years, adding: Instead of unbiased information, impartial analysis and sober forecasting, there are propaganda cliches in the spirit of Soviet newspapers of the 1930s. A system has been built that deceives itself. He was particularly critical of the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, who he said had gone from a “professional and educated intellectual” to becoming “a person who constantly broadcasts conflicting statements and threatens the world... with nuclear weapons”. Bondarev added: Today, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not about diplomacy. It is all about warmongering, lies and hatred. It serves interests of few, the very few people thus contributing to further isolation and degradation of my country. Russia no longer has allies, and there is no one to blame but its reckless and ill-conceived policy. He concluded by saying that he could no longer continue working for the foreign ministry and “shared in this bloody, witless and absolutely needless ignominy”. Neuer said Bondarev was a “hero”, adding: We are now calling on all other Russian diplomats at the United Nations—and worldwide—to follow his moral example and resign. US president Joe Biden said Russia must “pay a long-term price” for its “barbarism” in Ukraine in terms of sanctions imposed by the US and its allies. Biden was speaking to reporters earlier today during a visit to Tokyo, where he met with the Japanese prime minister, Fumio Kishida. The pair agreed to monitor Chinese naval activity and joint Chinese-Russia exercises. Asked if Washington was willing to get involved militarily to defend Taiwan, he replied: “Yes.” He added: “That’s the commitment we made.” Biden added: We agreed with the One China policy, we signed on to it … but the idea that it can be taken by force is just not appropriate, it would dislocate the entire region and would be another action similar to Ukraine. He directly linked the fates of Ukraine and Taiwan, saying western sanctions on Russia must exact a “long-term price” because otherwise: What signal does that send to China about the cost of attempting to take Taiwan by force? More than 6.5m people have fled Ukraine since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, the UN refugee agency said. A total of 6,538,998 refugees have left Ukraine, with the majority of them entering Poland. A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge, Serhii Ahafonov, at a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small room. The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he had not meant to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. Shishimarin, wearing a grey-and-blue hoodie, listened with his head bowed to the judge deliver his long verdict from inside the glass box for defendants. He was given a translation of the judge’s words from Ukrainian to Russian by a court-appointed translator. It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases related to war crimes that could come to trial soon, and Ukrainian authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes across the country. Trying cases so quickly, while the conflict is still ongoing, is extremely unusual and may violate elements of the Geneva conventions, legal experts say. However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit. Prosecutors said Shishimarin was in a car with other Russian soldiers, one of whom ordered him to shoot Shelipov, as he had been a witness to them shooting at a car and then stealing it. Read Shaun Walker’s full report here. Here’s a bit more detail from the Kremlin’s briefing earlier today. Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, blamed the west for triggering a global food crisis by imposing the most severe sanctions in modern history on Russia over the war in Ukraine, Reuters reports. Peskov told reporters: Russia has always been a rather reliable grain exporter. We are not the source of the problem. The source of the problem that leads to world hunger are those who imposed sanctions against us, and the sanctions themselves. Together, Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. Ukraine is also a major exporter of corn, barley, sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, while Russia and Belarus account for more than 40% of global exports of the crop nutrient potash. Thirty-six countries count on Russia and Ukraine for more than half their wheat imports, according to the United Nations, including some of the world’s poorest nations such as Lebanon, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Last week, the UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he was in intense contact with Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, the US and the EU in an effort to restore grain exports from Ukraine. Shaun Walker is at the Kyiv court where 21-year-old tank commander Vadim Shishimarin has been sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial since Russia’s invasion. A Russian soldier has been found guilty and sentenced to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial held in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion. Vadim Shishimarin,21, pleaded guilty to killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. The judge, Serhiy Agafonov, said Shishimarin, carrying out a “criminal order” by a soldier of higher rank, had fired several shots at the victim’s head from an automatic weapon. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong taking over from Martin Belam to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag. You can reach me on Twitter or via email. A Ukrainian court sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for killing an unarmed civilian in the first war crimes trial arising from Russia’s 24 February invasion. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, had pleaded guilty to killing the 62-year-old man in the north-eastern Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February after being ordered to shoot at him from a car. Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko has said that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”. Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last night that 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Donetsk’s self-proclaimed separatist leader Denis Pushilin has said that “the prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned.” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said that Russia was concerned by the trial of Shishimarin in Kyiv, adding that it could not defend his interests in person. Peskov also warned that Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. He proposed a full oil embargo and cutting off all of Russia’s banks from the international monetary system. Zelenskiy suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. The World Health Organization mission in Ukraine has said it has “verified 30 additional attacks on healthcare” in the country. It says: “As of 23 May, 248 attacks on health care have been verified in Ukraine. These attacks caused 75 deaths and 59 injuries.” Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has called for “maximum sanctions” against Russia in an address to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Saying that Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in February 2022 if it had been dealt a more severe economic blow after the 2014 annexation of Crimea, Zelenskiy proposed: A full oil embargo. That all Russian banks be barred from global systems with no exemptions. Cutting ties with Russia’s IT industry. No trade with Russia. Any company that leaves Russia is welcome to move to the Ukraine market, says Zelenskiy, saying companies would benefit by truly supporting freedom. On the massive challenge of rebuilding Ukraine, Zelenskiy said: We offer the world the chance to set a precedent for what happens if you try to destroy a neighbour. I invite you to take part in this rebuilding. He suggested the rebuilding could be partly funded by finding Russian assets hidden overseas, freezing them, and allocating them to a special fund to help those hurt by the war. Zelenskiy quoted George Marshall, who gave his name to the post-second world war rebuilding plan for Europe, who said he didn’t oppose any country, but opposed “hunger, poverty, despair, chaos”. Graeme Wearden is in Davos covering Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s address to the World Economic Forum: WEF founder Klaus Schwab introduces Zelenskiy, saying we have all seen his courageous leadership, and want to hear what lies ahead for Ukraine, and how we can assist. Zelenskiy begins by saying it is a great honour to take part in this year’s Davos – whose theme is history at a turning point. This year, the phrase word ‘turning point’ is more than rhetoric – this is the moment when it is decided whether brute force will rule the world, says Zelenskiy. Zelenskiy says Ukraine has fought longer than expected, but says it wouldn’t have needed to have endured the war, with so many casualties, if tough sanctions had been imposed last autumn. If there had been full unity back in 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea, would they have launched February’s invasion? Again, Zelenskiy thinks not. Follow it live here: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy addresses WEF – business live Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has been giving his usual daily brief to reporters, which Reuters are carrying some lines from. Peskov has said: Russian soldiers would have to be alert to “terrorist attacks” after the Russian-appointed mayor of the occupied city of Enerhodar in southern Ukraine was injured in an explosion on Sunday. The west had triggered a global food crisis by imposing the severest sanctions in modern history on Russia over the war in Ukraine. “Russia has always been a rather reliable grain exporter,” Peskov said. “We are not the source of the problem.” Russia was concerned by the trial of a Russian serviceman in Kyiv charged with war crimes, adding that it could not defend his interests in person. Peskov again said that pumping weapons into Ukraine would not boost security or stability in Europe. Here is that quote from Donetsk’s separatist leader Denis Pushilin about the fate of Ukrainian soldiers who were under siege in Azovstal. Interfax quote him saying: The prisoners from Azovstal are being held on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic. Organising an international tribunal on the republic’s territory is also planned. A Just Giving page has been has been set up by a Guardian reporter to raise funds for the safe evacuation to Switzerland of an eight-year- old boy who was left as the only child in his ruined village in north east Ukraine. He lived for 87 days below ground. The cause is urgent with Tymofiy and his family in need of help getting to Zurich – and even then their future is full of uncertainty. Here is the page. Tymofiy Seidov and his mother, aunt, grandmother and grandfather spent three months in a dark crowded 40x5-metre basement below the ruins of a kindergarten. Tymofiy spent much of his time drawing monsters and tanks, and also some remembered sunny days, while at a little table, dimly illuminated from above by a tiny LED light. When offered the chance to escape, he had begged to stay as he was terrified of the Russian shells that have rained down on his village since 24 February. His mum persuaded him that they needed to leave on Sunday 22 May. Here is the latest story on the evacuation. The family are now in western Ukraine but need help moving on. A reminder that Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will shortly be addressing the World Economic Forum from Davos. My colleague Graeme Wearden is there, and will be covering it live on our business blog. I’ll bring you the key lines here as well. There is a little bit more from Interfax, reporting the words of Russia’s deputy foreign minister Andrey Rudenko, saying that Moscow would be prepared to go back to peace negotiations when the leadership in Kyiv demonstrates “a constructive response”. He is also quoted as saying that Russia is not ruling out the possibility of a prisoner exchange involving those Ukrainian fighters who surrendered from the Azovstal plant. There is a quick snap going across the newswires via the Interfax news agency, which states that the leader of the pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk has said that all prisoners of war from the Azovstal steel plant will be tried by a tribunal in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. More to follow … Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s Luhansk governor, has given an update on the situation in Severodonetsk. He has posted to Telegram: The Russians damaged five high-rises and shopping areas of the central market. An elderly man was wounded. On 22 May, 11 enemy attacks were repelled, 6 tanks, 10 units of armoured combat vehicles and 6 units of motor vehicles were destroyed. Air defence units shot down 1 UAV Orlan-10 and an enemy Su-25 “Frogfoot”. The claims have not been independently verified. Daniel Boffey writes for us from Irpin in Ukraine about a couple who fled the city with 19 dogs: The image of a windswept young woman holding tight to the leads of nine dogs under an ominously dark sky spread far and wide at the time of the Battle of Kyiv. The apparent bravery of the woman, who was attempting an audacious evacuation across a broken bridge targeted by Russian fire, and the vulnerability of the animals, some of whom were strapped into dog wheelchairs, epitomised to many the cruelty of the war being waged by Vladimir Putin and the dignity of the Ukrainian response. The full story of the trials of Anastasiya Tykha,20, a veterinary student in the final year of her degree, and her husband Arthur Lee,26, is perhaps even more striking than the photograph, which the couple discovered had gone viral when Tykha saw herself on the television news and listened to the presenter report that she was dead. Read more of Daniel Boffey’s report here: ‘We had too much to do to be scared’ – the couple who fled Irpin with 19 dogs The World Health Organization mission in Ukraine has tweeted to say that it has “verified 30 additional attacks on healthcare” in the country. It says: As of 23 May, 248 attacks on health care have been verified in Ukraine. These attacks took place between 24 February and 19 May &amp; caused 75 deaths and 59 injuries. Health care should never be a target. A statue of Peter the Great in Deptford, south London, that Vladimir Putin’s government gifted to the UK has been damaged in an attempted robbery, leaving a diplomatically awkward repair bill of thousands of pounds. Millennium Quay, the owners of the Thames-side housing estatethat surrounds the statue, suggested the Russian embassy could pick up the tab. The embassy has not responded to requests for comment. The Deptford statue by Mihail Chemiakin, one of Putin’s favourite artists, commemorates the young tsar’s 1698 trip to Deptford to study English shipbuilding. Joel Coleman, Millennium Quay’s property manager, said: “We can get it restored if we can find out who owns it. In the last resort I’ll call the Russians. As it was a gift from the Russian people, we can see if the Russian embassy will pay for it.” Read more here: Peter the Great statue, Vladimir Putin’s gift to Londoners, damaged in attempted robbery Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted to Telegram to say that there will be a free evacuation train again at 4.30pm local time today to take people from Pokrovsk in Donetsk in the east of the country, out to Lviv in the west via Dnipro. On Sky News in the UK, the former chief of the general staff of the British army, Gen Lord Richard Dannatt, has said that Vladimir Putin has not achieved very much so far in this war. While, he said, “Mariupol was always going to fall at some point”, he added: The significance from the Ukrainian’s point of view was just how long the fighters within the steelworks managed to hold out and hold on, because that dragged in such large numbers of Russian troops who otherwise might have been deployed elsewhere. [Putin] feels obviously very strongly he’s got to achieve something. And that something is, in his view, the complete control of the Donbas region. Elsewhere they’ve done really poorly. I think the Russians, according to reports, are making some small gains but frankly, small gains isn’t going to win this campaign for them. The Ukrainians are still retaining the very well-prepared defensive positions that they’ve occupied for the last six, seven, eight years. With Ukrainian standing on the defence, it’s the Russians who have to throw their combat power against well-prepared Ukrainian positions. And that largely explains why the Russians are taking so many casualties. On the blockade of Odesa, he said: This is one of those major issues that doesn’t just affect the Ukrainian people. It affects all of us worldwide. From a military point of view it is a very interesting one to watch. Ukrainians will be desperate to hold on to Odesa, but they can’t use it as a port at the present moment. For defensive reasons they’ve heavily mined it. They are determined to prevent the Russians capturing Odessa and pushing up through to Transnistria in Moldova. Maksym Kozytskyi, Ukraine’s governor of Lviv, has given his daily update on the situation there. He reports that more people returned to Ukraine than fled over the border in the last 24 hours, with 32,000 leaving and 44,000 coming back. He reported there were two air alerts overnight, one for a suspected missile strike from the Black Sea, and another because “there was a danger from the territory of Belarus”. Whoever is running the Russian foreign ministry social media accounts this morning has gone on a bit of a retweeting spree, distributing some inflammatory claims about the situation in Ukraine from Russian diplomats over the last twelve hours. One message is from Dmitry Polyanskiy, Russian deputy ambassador to the UN, who says in a response to a message from Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba thanking Polish people for their help: The Polish dream to have Ukrainian neighbours as cheap labor and control and exploit their land as they did in 1918-1939 has come closer. They have also promoted a video clip from another diplomat, Alexander Alimov, which purports to show what he claims is the “Nazi Aidar battalion” mistreating civilians in the self-proclaimed republic in Luhansk. The ministry has also shared a message from a third diplomat, Mikhail Ulyanov, challenging US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s statement about potential food shortages caused by the blockading of the export of Ukraine’s grain. Ulyanov says: Russia expects a record-breaking harvest of wheat in 2022. We stand ready to offer to export 25m tons of grain … what the US is going to offer? My colleague Graeme Wearden has launched our business blog for the day, which is coming from Davos. Ukraine will be high on the agenda, with a special address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy scheduled for 11.15am local time (10.15am BST), and a discussion with Vitaliy and Wladimir Klitschko to follow that. I’ll pick up the key lines on this blog, but Graeme will have the full Davos coverage over here: Davos Day One – Ukrainian MPs call for more support as WEF begins The RIA news agency reports that Russia’s defence ministry says its forces destroyed a Ukrainian unit of US-produced M777 howitzers, a type of artillery weapon. The claim has not been independently verified. This is Martin Belam taking over the blog for the next few hours. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com. Before I hand you over to my colleague Martin Belam, here are the latest lines from Ukraine this morning: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, its lead negotiator said on Sunday, but the initiative to continue them was with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” he said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west. “After Bucha, Borodianka, Mariupol, there cannot be business as usual with Russia,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Russia’s death toll from its war on Ukraine is akin to the losses suffered in its war in Afghanistan, the UK Ministry of Defence has said. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it is likely to have suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the MoD claimed. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high casualty rate, British intelligence added. Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said in its latest operational report. Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum in Davos, which kicks off on Monday with a video address from Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed by Ukrainian artists into a “Russian war crimes house”, portraying images of misery and devastation. Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. A verdict in the conflict’s first war crimes trial is due today with a panel of judges in Kyiv determining the fate of 21-year-old Russian sergeant Vadim Shishimarin. New Zealand will deploy a further 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes. For a more comprehensive rundown please see our earlier summary. A verdict in the conflict’s first war crimes trial is due today with a panel of judges in Kyiv determining the fate of Russian sergeant Vadim Shishimarin. The shaven-headed 21-year-old from Siberia has admitted to killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in the early stages of the invasion, but earlier told the court he was pressured into an act for which he was “truly sorry”. “I was nervous about what was going on. I didn’t want to kill,” he said from the glass defence box, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, as the trial concluded on Friday. Shysimarin added: “I’m truly and sincerely sorry. I didn’t want that to happen, I didn’t want to be there, but it happened. I would like to apologise once again. And I will accept all the measures of punishment that I will be offered.” Shishimarin’s lawyer has argued for an acquittal, saying his client was carrying out what he perceived to be a direct order that he initially disobeyed. Prosecutors, who have asked for a life sentence, said he was “well aware” he was executing a “criminal order”. New Zealand will deploy another 30 defence force troops to the UK, to help train 230 Ukrainian soldiers in using a howitzer gun. The prime minister Jacinda Ardern announced on Monday the soldiers would be training their Ukrainian counterparts in operating a L119 105mm light field gun. The deployment was another way New Zealand could support Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s invasion, Ardern said. We have been clear throughout Russia’s assault on Ukraine, that such a blatant attack on innocent lives and the sovereignty of another country is wrong, and our response has not only included the condemnation of Russia, but practical support for Ukraine.” The prime minister said the troops will be in the UK until the end of July and train 230 Ukrainians. This new support comes in addition to the extensive assistance we have already provided to Ukraine, which encompasses the military, humanitarian, legal, and other aspects of the conflict. There are very few armed forces that could provide this training right now, which is why New Zealand has been specifically called upon.” The government will also provide 40 gun sights and a small quantity of ammunition for training purposes. “The 30 NZDF personnel will in no way enter the Ukraine for this training,” Ardern added. British prime minister Boris Johnson has penned an emotive letter to the children of Ukraine, commending them for holding their heads high in the “toughest of times” and reassuring them they are not alone, according to a report from PA Media. The prime minister said he was “very sad” to see youngsters absent from the streets and parks of Kyiv when he visited the Ukrainian capital last month, adding: “I cannot imagine how difficult this year must have been for you.” When your president showed me around Kyiv last month, the absence of children and young people on the streets and in the parks made me feel very sad. Since the invasion many of you have been forced to flee your homes. You have left behind family, friends, pets, toys and all that is familiar, seeking refuge in underground stations, distant cities, even other countries. I cannot imagine how difficult this year must have been for you. Many of you have seen or experienced things no child should have to witness. Yet, every day Ukrainian children are teaching all of us what it means to be strong and dignified, to hold your head high in even the toughest of times. I can think of no better role model for children and adults everywhere.” Earlier, Johnson resolved to “redouble efforts” to provide vital food and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and ensure the country is able to export to the rest of the world. In a call to Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday, Johnson said that Britons are “1000%” behind the people of Ukraine. In the first three months since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has likely suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine year war in Afghanistan, the UK ministry of defence has claimed. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach which is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released this morning. Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.” Russia is “concentrating its efforts” on assaults on the eastern Ukrainian city of Siverodonetsk and the nearby town of Toshkivka, the Ukrainian military has said. Russian forces are also preparing to resume an offensive in the Slovyansk direction after its troops were repelled following a failed operation in the area of Dovhenke, Ukraine’s latest operational report reads. In the Kharkiv region, Russian forces have set up checkpoints and fortifications on access roads near the settlements of Velykyi Burluk, Kapitolivka, Mykhailivka, Levkivka, Zabavne and Kupyansk, Oleksandr Shtupun, spokesman for the general staff of the armed forces of Ukraine said. Meanwhile, in the Donetsk direction, Russian forces are reportedly attempting to break through the defences of Ukrainian troops and reach the administrative borders of Luhansk oblast. Russia is focusing its main efforts on “maintaining occupied frontiers, conducting reconnaissance and engineering activities of positions”, Ukraine’s military claims adding its forced thwarted 11 Russian attacks in Donetsk and Luhansk over the past 24 hours. The conflict in Ukraine is making its mark at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Kyiv will continues its diplomatic counteroffensive by targeting the world’s business and political elite gathering in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos during a four-day meeting of global business leaders. Talks will begin on Monday with a video address by Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. This is the world’s most influential economic platform where Ukraine has something to say,” the Ukrainian president said in an earlier address. Zelenskiy will also mark the opening of Ukraine House Davos, a forum for Kyiv and its international backers. “Ukraine House Davos will host dialogue on security, sanctions, humanitarian aid, rebuilding and revitalising Ukraine, and more,” an official statement reads. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg are among the leaders due to address the meeting. In March, Davos organisers cut ties with Russian firms and officials, and announced that anyone under international sanctions would not be welcome at the event. The main street in the town in Switzerland has been turned into a Russian War Crimes House by Ukrainian artists hoping to get their message across to world leaders, Reuters reports. Visitors are confronted by images such as a badly burned man in Kharkiv after Russian shelling and a film made up of thousands of pictures of dead civilians and bombed houses. “The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos this year will be the most timely and consequential annual meeting since the creation of the forum over 50 years ago,’’ WEF founder Klaus Schwab told reporters ahead of the meeting. “The return of war, epidemics and the climate crisis, all those disruptive forces have derailed the global recovery,” Schwab said. “Those issues must be confronted in Davos; the global food crisis, in particular, needs our immediate attention.” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said 50 to 100 Ukrainians are dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region and that Sievierodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions” though Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city. Russian airstrikes hit Ukrainian forces in the Mykolaiv and Donbas regions, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, the Russian defence ministry said on Sunday. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesperson for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points and four ammunition depots in the Donbas. A British intelligence report released on Sunday claimed the city of Sievierodonetsk in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region is one of Russia’s “immediate tactical priorities” as its forces deploy terminator tanks to the area. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be bringing you all the latest developments for the next short while before my colleagues in London take the reins a little later in the day. On today’s agenda, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will continue his diplomatic counteroffensive by targeting the world’s business and political elite gathering in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos. Zelenskiy will kick off the four-day World Economic Forum of global business leaders with a video address. Zelenskiy has also claimed that up to 100 Ukrainians are dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. Here is everything you might have missed: Ukraine has said it will not agree to any ceasefire deal that would involve handing over territory to Russia, as Moscow intensified its attack in the eastern Donbas region. “The war must end with the complete restoration of Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty,” said Ukraine’s presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak. The comments came as Russia said it was willing to resume peace negotiations, its lead negotiator said Sunday, but the initiative to continue them was with Kyiv. Kremlin aide Vladimir Medinsky claimed in an interview with Belarusian TV that “Russia has never refused talks”. “Freezing talks was entirely Ukraine’s initiative,” he said, adding that the “ball is completely in their court”. Polish president Andrzej Duda became the first foreign leader to address the Ukrainian parliament in person since the invasion began, backing Ukraine’s stance on territorial concessions and warning the international community that ceding any territory to Russia would be a “huge blow” to the entire west. “After Bucha, Borodianka, Mariupol, there cannot be business as usual with Russia,” he said. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said 50 to 100 Ukrainians were dying every day on the war’s eastern front in what appeared to be a reference to military casualties. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two regions that make up the Donbas. Serhiy Gaidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region. Ukraine is set to top the agenda at the four-day World Economic Forum in Davos, which kicks off on Monday with a video address from Zelenskiy. This year Russia’s “house” at the event was transformed by Ukrainian artists into a “Russian war crimes house”, portraying images of misery and devastation. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Zelenskiy on Sunday evening about Russia’s blockade of Odesa, Ukraine’s largest shipping port. The blockade of Ukraine’s ports has been a growing concern for world leaders as many continue to warn about global food security, in particular for developing countries. The Moscow-installed mayor of Enerhodar, a southern city of Ukraine and the location of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, has been wounded in an explosion. Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported that Andrey Shevchik was in intensive care. A bid by Ukraine to join the European Union would not be finalised for “15 or 20 years”, France’s Europe minister said. “We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you’re lying,” Clément Beaune said. “It’s probably in 15 or 20 years. It takes a long time.” Zelenskiy has extended Ukraine’s martial law for three months through to 23 August. Ukraine’s parliament also banned the symbols “Z” and “V”, used by Russia’s military to promote its war in Ukraine, but agreed to Zelenskiy’s call to allow their use for educational or historic purposes. Olena Zelenska has given a rare interview with Zelenskiy, only their second public appearance together since Russia launched its invasion. She recounts the “anxiety and stupor” she felt on 24 February, and says that even though she has barely seen her husband since, “no one, not even the war, could take him away” from her. Technicians linked to the Syrian military’s infamous barrel bombs that have wreaked devastation across much of the country have been deployed to Russia to help potentially prepare for a similar campaign in the Ukraine war, European officials believe. Intelligence officers say more than 50 specialists have been in Russia for several weeks working alongside officials from president Vladimir Putin’s military. YouTube has taken down more than 70,000 videos and 9,000 channels related to the war in Ukraine for violating content guidelines, including removal of videos that referred to the invasion as a “liberation mission”.

Fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers unclear as Azovstal resistance ends,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/fate-hundreds-ukrainian-soldiers-unclear-azovstal-resistance-ends,2022-05-17T17:52:57Z,Ukraine says there will be prisoner swap but some Russian officials have said forces could be tried or executed,"The fate of hundreds of Ukrainian soldiers who have ended weeks of resistance at the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol remains unclear, after the fighters surrendered and were transferred to Russian-controlled territory. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said they would be swapped in a prisoner exchange, but some Russian officials said on Tuesday they could be tried and even executed. MPs in Russia’s State Duma said they would propose new laws that could derail prisoner exchanges of fighters who Moscow claims are “terrorists”. Russian investigators have said they plan to interrogate the soldiers and could charge them with “crimes committed by the Ukrainian regime against the civilian population in south-east Ukraine”. On Tuesday evening, seven buses carrying Ukrainian soldiers left the Azovstal plant in the port city and arrived at a former prison colony in the Russian-controlled town of Olenivka in Donetsk, Reuters reported. Russia called the Azovstal operation a mass surrender, while the Ukrainian army said the soldiers defending the steel plant had “performed their combat task” and that the main goal was now to save their lives. “Ukraine needs Ukrainian heroes alive,” said the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a video address. For weeks, hundreds of troops have been holed up in a warren of tunnels and bunkers underneath the steelworks, as Russian forces took control of the rest of the city after turning much of it into an uninhabitable wasteland. Many of those stuck at Azovstal had serious injuries, with limited medical care and dwindling supplies. In the last few weeks, civilians who had also taken cover in the plant were rescued after a deal was brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross to allow them to leave for Ukrainian-controlled territory. Ukraine had been pushing for a deal that would also allow the fighters to retreat to Ukrainian-controlled areas, or for their evacuation to a neutral country. However, with that not forthcoming, Ukrainian officials announced in the early hours of Tuesday that the defence of the plant was in effect over. “This was the only option,” said the deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar. Russia’s defence ministry said 265 Ukrainian fighters surrendered at the plant, including 51 seriously injured soldiers who would be transferred to hospitals in Novoazovsk in Russian-controlled territory in east Ukraine. It was not immediately clear how many Ukrainian troops remained in the plant. Footage shared by pro-Russia social media accounts showed groups of soldiers carrying out the wounded on stretchers amid the devastation outside the plant. “An exchange procedure will take place for their return home,” said Maliar. Ukraine’s deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk also said the fighters would be exchanged. “God willing, everything will be fine,” she wrote. Zelenskiy sounded a more cautious note. “The work of bringing the boys home continues, and this work needs delicacy – and time,” he said. Details of the agreement that led to the evacuation remain unclear, and a flurry of hardline statements from Russian officials suggested an exchange could still be some way off. Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, promised that the fighters who surrendered would be treated “in accordance with international standards”, but this was immediately undermined by statements from two other Russian officials. Leonid Slutsky, a Russian MP who took part in negotiations with Ukraine earlier in the war, suggested Russia should lift its moratorium on the death penalty for fighters from the Azov regiment, one of the main forces defending the steelworks, calling them “animals in human form”. “Nazi criminals should not be exchanged,” said Vyacheslav Volodin, one of Russia’s most powerful officials and the chair of the State Duma, during a speech on Tuesday. “Our country treats those who surrendered or were captured humanely. But with regards to Nazis, our position should be unchanged: these are war criminals and we must do everything so that they stand trial.” Volodin did not directly address the surrender of the troops at Azovstal in his statement, but the context was clear as Russia’s defence ministry released video of the evacuation of the Ukrainian fighters on Tuesday morning, saying some of them were members of the Azov battalion. Russia’s justice ministry appealed to the supreme court to declare the Azov regiment a terrorist organisation on Tuesday, possibly introducing another hurdle to a potential exchange. On Tuesday evening Russia’s investigative committee said it would interrogate the captured fighters and could seek to charge them with crimes against civilians in the Donbas region of east Ukraine. “Russian investigators will identify the nationalists, check them for involvement in crimes committed against the civilian population, and the information obtained during the interrogations will be compared with other data available,” the committee said in a statement. Azov has been a key part of the Russian propaganda narrative about the war in Ukraine, which was originally launched with the supposed goal of “denazification”. It was formed in 2014 as a volunteer militia to fight Russia-backed forces in east Ukraine and many of its original members had far-right extremist views. Since then, the unit has been integrated into the Ukrainian national guard and its commanders say it has moved away from its far-right origins. The defence of Mariupol has come to symbolise heroism in the face of the Russian attack for many millions of Ukrainians. As well as the boost to morale, Ukrainian military sources have claimed that by putting up such a fierce fight for Mariupol, the Russian army’s advance was stalled. On Twitter, the Zelenskiy adviser Mykhailo Podolyak compared the Azovstal defenders to the small force of Spartans who held out against a much larger attacking force in the battle of Thermopylae in the fifth century BC. The defence of Mariupol “completely changed the course of the war” and “ruined Russia’s plans to capture the east of Ukraine”, he wrote. Sandra Krotevych, the sister of Azov’s chief of staff, Bohdan Krotevych, said she had been in contact with her brother at 5am on Tuesday and he was still on the territory of Azovstal, but since then she had not heard from him. In recent weeks, she said, as the supplies hoarded in the steelworks began to dwindle and Russian strikes on the plant continued, the soldiers had been eating only once a day and had been drinking water from pipes and other unclean sources. Sandra Krotevych said the fighters had long realised Mariupol no longer had strategic importance for the Ukrainian army and were hoping to be able to bury their dead and evacuate their injured, but they had been holding out for a deal that would have allowed them to leave to Ukraine-controlled territory or a third country. “To put it mildly, I’m a bit surprised. I am not happy about it and I would have liked to hear security guarantees before this happened,” she said in a telephone interview. Now the fighters are at the mercy of Russian authorities, with hardline commentators demanding they are not exchanged. On the state-funded RT, the commentator Anton Krasovsky called the evacuees “wounded terrorists” and demanded they should not be handed over to Ukraine. “Any Azov member given to Kyiv will be treated as our defeat, as our Russian capitulation,” said Krasovsky. He called on his viewers “not to allow this”, saying there should be a trial and “RT can hold a livestream for their wives”. Amid such rhetoric from Russia, Krotevych called on the international community to find a way to ensure the soldiers were returned to Ukraine. “Their lives are in the hands of international leaders. If they can find a way to save them, then all the citizens of Ukraine will be extremely grateful. They are heroes for the whole of Ukraine,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine has had ‘some success’ in the battles in Sievierodonetsk, Zelenskiy says – as it happened",https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/jun/02/russia-ukraine-war-latest-zelenskiy-says-243-children-so-far-killed-in-war-russia-claims-latest-us-weapons-package-is-direct-provocation-live,2022-06-03T00:55:18Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. In the meantime you can follow all the latest news from our reporters on the ground here. Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The front lines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president said, adding that 100 Ukrainians are dying on a daily basis in eastern Ukraine, and another 450-500 people are wounded. Ukraine has had “some success” in the battles in Sievierodonetsk but it is too early to tell, according to Zelenskiy. “The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack,” he said in his latest national address. Some 60% of the infrastructure and residential buildings in Lysychansk, one of only two cities in the east still under at least partial Ukrainian control, have been destroyed from attacks, according to a local official. Oleksandr Zaika, head of Lysychansk City Military-Civil Administration, said 20,000 people are left in the city, down from a pre-war population of 97,000. About 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia has taken control of most of Sieverodonetsk, which has come under intense Russian shelling. Civilians are being urged to evacuate the eastern Ukrainian city of Sloviansk as Russia bombing intensifies. With no water or electricity, 100 people heeded the mayor’s call on Thursday to evacuate. Pro-Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine said a decree has been issued to “nationalise” state assets in the south-eastern region. The deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, Andrei Trofimov, said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources, facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February. Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance was in touch with Turkey to find a “united way” forward to address Ankara’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s bid to join the pact. Stoltenberg’s latest remarks come after he told reporters yesterday that he would convene senior officials from Finland, Sweden and Turkey in Brussels in the coming days to discuss the issue. The White House announced a fresh round of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian government officials and elites as well as several yachts linked to Vladimir Putin. The sanctions were announced as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to the US and its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for a new $700m weapons package for Ukraine. EU ambassadors dropped the leader of Russia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, from a proposed blacklist, according to diplomats. The removal of Patriarch Kirill from the list of sanctioned individuals allows the EU to agree on a new round of sanctions after opposition from Hungary. Russia has accused the son of a Conservative MP of involvement in the killing of a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine. Russia’s National Guard said one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian,” Ben Grant. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said it’s in the European Union’s strategic interest but also “our moral duty” to make it possible for Ukraine to join the 30-nation bloc. “In a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it,” Zelenskiy said in his latest national address. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths is in Moscow on Thursday and Friday to discuss clearing the way for exports of grain and other food from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Since the invasion, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of western sanctions imposed on Russia has hurt its fertiliser and grain exports. Ten Russian servicemen who looted the property of Bucha residents have been identified and reported on suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war. “Pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings is carried out by investigators of ... the National Police of Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s prosecutor general in a statement on Thursday. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said it’s in the European Union’s strategic interest but also “our moral duty” to make it possible for Ukraine to join the 30-nation bloc. Von der Leyen made her remarks on Thursday at an international security conference in Slovakia’s capital. Zelenskiy has asked for more weapons for Ukraine’s armed forces to be able to prevail over the invading Russian military, called for more EU sanctions against Russia, and repeated his country’s request to become “a full-fledge member of the united Europe.” It is very important that now - in a few weeks - we are waiting for the answer of the European Union on the issue of candidate status for Ukraine. We are very much looking forward to it,” he said in his latest national address. Von der Leyen says Ukraine must meet all necessary standards and conditions to be able to join but she has called on the EU to help Ukraine achieve its goal. She said: “Supporting Ukraine on its path to the European Union, it is not a burden, it is our historic responsibility.” The United States and its allies will support international investigations into atrocities in Ukraine to hold Russia accountable for crimes committed by its forces since they invaded Ukraine on 24 February. A UN Security Council meeting held on Thursday discussed strengthening accountability and justice for serious violations of international law. US Undersecretary of State Uzra Zeya said the United States is working with its allies to support a broad range of international investigations into atrocities in Ukraine. We have witnessed Russian forces bombing maternity hospitals, train stations, apartment buildings and homes, and civilians killed even as they bicycled down a street. We have received credible reports of Russian forces torturing and committing execution-style killings of people with their hands bound behind their back. We have received reports of women and girls being raped, some publicly, and children taken away to Russia and put up for adoption. And we know that Russian forces continue to deny safe passage to civilians fleeing violence and to humanitarian organisations trying to reach those in need ... Those who perpetrated these crimes must be held to account. Our message to Russia’s military and political leadership is this: the world is watching you, and you will be held accountable.” Ukraine has had “some success” in the battles in Sievierodonetsk but it is too early to tell, according to president Volodymyr Zelenskiy. “The situation there is the hardest now. Just as in the cities and communities nearby - Lysychansk, Bakhmut and others. Many cities are facing a powerful Russian attack,” he said in his latest national address. Zelenskiy added that the “absolutely senseless” shelling of Ukraine’s border northern regions, in particular Chernihiv, continues. “Mykolaiv, Kharkiv, the Kharkiv region were shelled. The entire temporarily occupied territory of our state is now a zone of total catastrophe, for which Russia is fully responsible.” It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Some 60% of the infrastructure and residential buildings in Lysychansk, one of only two cities in the east still under at least partial Ukrainian control, have been destroyed from attacks, a local official said Thursday. Oleksandr Zaika, head of Lysychansk City Military-Civil Administration, said 20,000 people are left in the city, down from a pre-war population of 97,000. Ukrainian forces have had some success fighting Russians in the city of Sievierodonetsk but the overall military situation in the Donbas region has not changed in the last 24 hours, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday. He also thanked US president Joe Biden for promising to send missiles and said he expected good news about weapons supplies from other partners. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths is in Moscow on Thursday and Friday to discuss clearing the way for exports of grain and other food from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. Since the invasion, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of western sanctions imposed on Russia has hurt its fertilizer and grain exports. The bombing in eastern Ukraine is becoming more intense and, with no water or electricity, 100 people or so heeded the mayor’s call on Thursday to evacuate the city of Sloviansk which sits in Russia’s crosshairs. Mayor Vadim Liakh, spoke of a fresh bombardment on Thursday that damaged electricity lines on the edge of the city which boasted a population of 100,000 before the late February invasion. 10 Russian servicemen who looted the property of Bucha residents have been identified and reported on suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war. “Pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings is carried out by investigators of ... the National Police of Ukraine,” said Ukraine’s prosecutor general in a statement on Thursday. The European Parliament announced on Thursday that it has banned all Russian lobbyists from its premises to prevent them spreading Moscow “propaganda” about Russia’s war in Ukraine. “Effective immediately, Russian company representatives are no longer allowed to enter European Parliament premises,” the European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator, Energoatom, on Thursday denied it might shut down a major atomic power plant that lies in Russian-occupied territory if Kyiv loses control of operations at the site. In a statement, Energoatom said the plant “cannot be turned off from a technical, security, economic or political point of view”. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Some 60% of the infrastructure and residential buildings in Lysychansk, one of only two cities in the east still under at least partial Ukrainian control, have been destroyed from attacks, a local official said Thursday, the Associated Press reports. Oleksandr Zaika, head of Lysychansk City Military-Civil Administration, said on an “information telemarathon” cited by the Unian news agency that non-stop shelling had knocked out electricity, natural gas, telephone and internet service. One of the most critical pathways for supplies and evacuations, the Bakhmut-Lysychansk highway, is still open but under constant bombardment. Humanitarian supplies are still reaching the city, where shrapnel and mines dot the landscape, he said. Zaika said 20,000 people are left in the city, down from a pre-war population of 97,000. Lysychansk is separated by a river from the other city in the region that’s still under at least partial Ukrainian control, Sievierodonetsk. It, too, is under Russian siege. Pedestrians pass by empty yellow school busses where stuffed toys symbolizing each of the 243 killed Ukrainian children are displayed on seats during an action marking the International Children’s Day, in Lviv, Agence France-Presse reports. Ukrainian forces have had some success fighting Russians in the city of Sievierodonetsk but the overall military situation in the Donbas region has not changed in the last 24 hours, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday, Reuters reports. In a late night video address, Ukraine’s president thanked the US president, Joe Biden, for promising to send missiles and said he expected good news about weapons supplies from other partners. UN aid chief Martin Griffiths is in Moscow on Thursday and Friday to discuss clearing the way for exports of grain and other food from Ukraine’s Black Sea ports, Reuters reports. Griffiths will meet Russian officials days after another senior UN official, Rebecca Grynspan, had “constructive” talks in Moscow with Russia’s first deputy prime minister, Andrei Belousov, on expediting Russian grain and fertilizer exports. The UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, is trying to broker what he calls a “package deal” to resume both Ukrainian food exports and Russian food and fertilizer exports, which were disrupted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February. “The situation remains fluid. The Secretary-General, and the two main people he has tasked to work on this, Rebecca Grynspan and Martin Griffiths - we will do and go anywhere we need to go to push this project forward,” UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said. Russia’s defence ministry said on Thursday that vessels carrying grain can leave Ukraine’s ports in the Black Sea via “humanitarian corridors” and Russia is ready to guarantee their safety, Interfax news agency said. Russia’s war in Ukraine has fuelled a global food crisis with prices for grains, cooking oils, fuel and fertilizer soaring. Russia and Ukraine account for nearly a third of global wheat supplies. Russia is also a fertilizer exporter and Ukraine is a major exporter of corn and sunflower oil. Since the invasion, Ukrainian grain shipments from its Black Sea ports have stalled and more than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos, while Moscow says the chilling effect of Western sanctions imposed on Russia has hurt its fertilizer and grain exports. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said on Tuesday that the United States is prepared to give “comfort letters” to shipping and insurance companies to help facilitate exports of Russian grain and fertilizer. But she also said: “Russia is able to get its oil out, and that’s sanctioned. They should be able to get their grain out that’s not sanctioned.” The bombing in eastern Ukraine is becoming more intense and, with no water or electricity, 100 people or so heeded the mayor’s call on Thursday to evacuate the city of Sloviansk which sits in Russia’s crosshairs, Agence France-Presse reports. “The situation is getting worse, the explosions are stronger and stronger and the bombs are falling more often,” 18-year-old student Goulnara Evgaripova told AFP. Outside an administrative office, she boarded one of five minibuses earmarked to take people out of the city in the Donetsk region that Moscow wants to control. One Russian strike killed three people, wounded six and left a trail of damage on Tuesday in Sloviansk, witnesses told AFP. Mayor Vadim Liakh, spoke of a fresh bombardment on Thursday that damaged electricity lines on the edge of the city which boasted a population of 100,000 before the late February invasion. “There is no electricity, the water supply is down,” Liakh posted on the Telgram messenger service. “The best solution in this situation, is to evacuate. “Take care of yourselves. Pack your bags,” he urged. In 2014, when Russia grabbed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, Moscow-backed separatists also seized Sloviansk, before Ukrainian forces regained control. 10 Russian servicemen who looted the property of Bucha residents have been identified and reported on suspicion of violating the laws and customs of war, Euromaidan reports. “According to the investigation, from February 24 to March 31, 2022, servicemen of the military unit of the National Guard of the Russian Federation during the occupation of Bucha looted the valuables of the local population. For the sole purpose of personal gain, the Russian military confiscated private property of citizens that could not be used for military purposes: from underwear and clothing to large household appliances,” the office of Ukraine’s Prosecutor General said in a statement on Thursday. “Pre-trial investigation in criminal proceedings is carried out by investigators of...the National Police of Ukraine,” the statement added. The European Parliament announced on Thursday that it has banned all Russian lobbyists from its premises to prevent them spreading Moscow “propaganda” about Russia’s war in Ukraine, Agence France-Presse reports. “Effective immediately, Russian company representatives are no longer allowed to enter European Parliament premises,” the European Parliament president Roberta Metsola said on Twitter. Metsola urged all other EU institutions, including the European Commission and the European Council, to follow suit. A parliament spokesman said the ban was a response to “Russia creating and spreading false narratives about the war in Ukraine through multiple channels, including through state-owned companies”. The prohibition applies to Russian companies listed as employing lobbyists to the EU as well as those on the bloc’s sanction blacklist. The parliament in 2015 had already banned Russian diplomats from its premises, which include chambers and annexes in Brussels and the French city of Strasbourg, in response to Moscow banning several EU politicians vociferous over its annexation of Crimea. German MEP Erik Marquardt, of the Greens, welcomed the ban saying that “especially oil and gas lobbyists” working on behalf of Russian companies had been trying to “spread propaganda and disinformation” in recent months. Ukraine’s state-run nuclear power operator, Energoatom, on Thursday denied it might shut down a major atomic power plant that lies in Russian-occupied territory if Kyiv loses control of operations at the site, Reuters reports. The Zaporizhzhia facility in southeast Ukraine is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. Russian troops have taken over the plant, but Ukrainian specialists are still running it. Russian news agency Interfax cited a Ukrainian presidential aide as saying the plant could be shut down if Kyiv lost all control. But in a statement, Energoatom said the plant “cannot be turned off from a technical, security, economic or political point of view.” Ukraine’s state-owned grid operator last week dismissed as “physically impossible” the suggestion by a Russian official that the plant would supply Russia with electricity. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Pro-Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine said a decree has been issued to “nationalise” state assets in the south-eastern region. The deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, Andrei Trofimov, said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources, facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February. Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance was in touch with Turkey to find a “united way” forward to address Ankara’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s bid to join the pact. Stoltenberg’s latest remarks come after he told reporters yesterday that he would convene senior officials from Finland, Sweden and Turkey in Brussels in the coming days to discuss the issue. Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The front lines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president said, adding that 100 Ukrainians are dying on a daily basis in eastern Ukraine, and another 450-500 people are wounded. Zelenskiy said 243 children have been killed, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing so far in the war in Ukraine. Some 200,000 children have been forcefully taken to Russia, he claimed, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families. The White House announced a fresh round of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian government officials and elites as well as several yachts linked to Vladimir Putin. The sanctions were announced as Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to the US and its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for a new $700m weapons package for Ukraine. EU ambassadors dropped the leader of Russia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, from a proposed blacklist, according to diplomats. The removal of Patriarch Kirill from the list of sanctioned individuals allows the EU to agree on a new round of sanctions after opposition from Hungary. About 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. The UK’s ministry of defence said Russia has taken control of most of Sieverodonetsk, which has come under intense Russian shelling. Russia has accused the son of a Conservative MP of involvement in the killing of a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine. Russia’s National Guard said one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian,” Ben Grant. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today. I’ll be back tomorrow. My colleague, Maya Yang, will be here shortly to bring you the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Pro-Russian officials in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine said a decree has been issued to “nationalise” state assets in the southeastern region. The decree has been signed by officials installed by Moscow and applies to strategic firms, land and natural resources, the RIA news agency quoted the administration as saying. The “liberated” region of Zaporizhzhia will “nationalise” the state property of Ukraine, a member of the region’s pro-Moscow military-civilian administration, Vladimir Rogov, wrote on Telegram. The deputy head of the Moscow-imposed administration, Andrei Trofimov, said the nationalisation would affect land, natural resources, facilities in strategic sectors of the economy, as well as property owned by Ukraine as of 24 February – the day when Russia invaded. Trofimov said: The decree was signed in order to meet state needs related to improving the overall efficiency and social orientation of the economy, as well as to preserve the national heritage for residents of the Zaporizhzhia Region. Russia claimed full control of the Kherson region in March and holds parts of the Zaporizhzhia region to the northeast. In May, Putin signed a decree simplifying the procedure for residents of the regions of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson to apply for Russian citizenship. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said the alliance was in touch with Turkey to find a “united way” forward to address Ankara’s concerns over Sweden and Finland’s bid to join the pact. The two Nordic countries said yesterday that they would continue a dialogue with Turkey over their Nato bids but did not say whether there had been progress on overcoming Ankara’s objections. Referring to talks that took place in Ankara last week between delegations from all three countries, Finland’s foreign minister, Pekka Haavisto, said: Together with Sweden, we will do our homework and prepare for the questions Turkey has. Stoltenberg said he would convene senior officials from Finland, Sweden and Turkey in Brussels in the coming days to discuss the issue. Turkey will donate a Bayraktar combat drone to Lithuania to be handed over to Ukraine after hundreds of Lithuanians crowdfunded nearly six million euros to buy it, Lithuania’s defence ministry said. The manufacturer Baykar will deliver the TB2 advanced combat drone, painted in the colours of the Lithuanian and Ukrainian flags, in a few weeks, according to the ministry. In a statement, the Lithuanian defence ministry said: We came to Turkey to agree on conditions for the drone purchase, but they prepared the most pleasant surprise possible for us. A total of €5.9m was raised in just days, largely in small amounts between €5 and €100, to fund the purchase of the military drone, according to Laisves TV, the Lithuanian internet broadcaster that launched the drive. About €1.5m of the funds raised by Lithuanians will be used to pay for armaments for the drone, the defence ministry said, with the rest used to help Ukraine. Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. It takes borrowing costs to their highest level since September 2015 – when Ukraine’s economy was reeling from Russia’s annexation of Crimea – and the highest in Europe. The Russian invasion has devastated Ukraine’s economy, which the World Bank has forecast could shrink by at least a third this year. The war has forced businesses to close, destroyed infrastructure, blocked shipping routes and reduced whole towns to rubble. Shevchenko called for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new aid programme. The increase was criticised by an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, who said the rate was too high and dangerous to the economy during wartime. It was not clear whether he was speaking in a personal capacity. The National Bank of Ukraine had frozen its main rate 10% at the start of the invasion, but last week signalled it could resume regular monetary policy reviews as business activity partially recovered in safer parts of the country. It is betting that a sharp rate rise will also nudge the government to lift the yield on domestic bonds, making assets held in its currency, the hryvnia, more attractive and preventing household incomes and savings from being eroded by inflation. Inflation was already in double digits before the conflict began and climbed further to about 17% in May from 16.4% in April, according to central bank estimates. It said inflation could double in 2022 from 10% in 2021, pushed up by rising global prices and the damage of the war on domestic production and supply chains. The number of small businesses that had suspended operations in April fell to 26% from 73% in March, according to a survey by the European Business Association, the union of businesses operating in Ukraine. Russian forces are occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. Frontlines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), the Ukrainian president added. It is just past 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament.

Weapons sent to Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in February will end up in the global hidden economy and in the hands of criminals, the head of Interpol has said. Jürgen Stock says once the conflict ends, a wave of guns and heavy arms will flood the international market and he urged Interpol’s member states, especially those supplying weapons, to cooperate on arms tracing. Good afternoon from London. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong here to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia has accused the son of a Conservative MP of involvement in the killing of a Chechen brigade commander in Ukraine, after footage emerged of the British national fighting in the country. Russia’s National Guard, a force also known as Rosgvardia, said in a statement posted on its website that one of its commanders, the Chechen fighter Adam Bisultanov, was killed on 26 May in a clash with a “group of mercenaries from the UK and the USA” that included the “son of a British parliamentarian,” Ben Grant. Grant first arrived in Ukraine in March, when he told the Guardian he was moved to volunteer after seeing footage of a Russian bombing of a house where a child could be heard screaming. He said he went without telling his mother, MP Helen Grant, he was going. In dramatic footage posted online this week, Grant, who is a veteran of Afghanistan and a former Royal Marine, can be heard saying “go, go” as he and his unit exit a patch of woods and fire a Matador anti-tank missile at what is believed to be a Russian BTR-80 armoured personnel carrier. Rosgvardia in its statement said that the Chechen commander Bisultanov was killed when his BTR-80 vehicle was hit three times by the foreign fighters, posting a picture of the vehicle’s carcass online. In separate video, published by the Telegraph, Grant is seen dragging another British volunteer to safety after a Russian ambush in a woodland north of Kharkiv. Grant told the newspaper that his unit of 15 Br",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
tish and American volunteers and two Ukrainian interpreters had been preparing an assault on a Russian-held target when they came under heavy Russian fire earlier this month. “I’ve never experienced anything like that in my life. I was terrified but driven to complete my most important goal, which at the time was getting him and my team out of the danger,” Grant said. Since Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced the creation of the International Legion of Ukraine in March, thousands of people from around the world, some with a military background and many without, have arrived in Ukraine. In a briefing on Thursday, the Russian Ministry of Defence said that it had “eliminated hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine,” adding that 3,500 foreign fighters were currently in the country. The ministry also warned that captured foreign soldiers will not be treated under the standards of international humanitarian law. The US decision to supply Ukraine with high-precision multiple launch rocket systems was marked with some fanfare in Washington including a rare newspaper commentary by Joe Biden himself. The Himars (High mobility artillery rocket system) and the ammunition that Washington is sending with them, will allow Ukrainian forces to hit targets nearly 80km away with high accuracy. That’s twice the range of the US howitzers they have now, and about the same as the most powerful Russian rocket systems. US officials suggested they would help turn the withering artillery duel underway in the Donbas into a fairer fight. However, the small print of the deal was underwhelming. This first Himars delivery comprises just four systems, and although they have been pre-positioned in the region for fast delivery, it will take three weeks to train Ukrainian gunners to use them, and another two weeks to train maintenance crews. In the meantime, Russian artillery is blanketing Ukrainian positions in the east. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in an interview on Wednesday that up to 100 Ukrainian soldiers are being killed a day and another 500 are wounded. Without stand-off weapons that can target the Russian guns from afar, Ukrainian lines are being pummelled and national morale, one of the decisive factors in the successful defence of Kyiv, is also taking a beating. Zelenskiy’s government has been screaming for multiple launch rockets for weeks, as it became clear that the battle for the east and south had become one of attrition, so why did it take this long for Biden to make the decision to respond? Read Julian’s full analysis: Biden’s pledge to send rocket systems to Ukraine is no silver bullet Weapons sent to Ukraine after Russia’s invasion in February will end up in the global hidden economy and in the hands of criminals, the head of Interpol has said. Jürgen Stock says once the conflict ends, a wave of guns and heavy arms will flood the international market and he urged Interpol’s member states, especially those supplying weapons, to cooperate on arms tracing. “Once the guns fall silent [in Ukraine], the illegal weapons will come. We know this from many other theatres of conflict. The criminals are even now, as we speak, focusing on them,” Stock said. “Criminal groups try to exploit these chaotic situations and the availability of weapons, even those used by the military and including heavy weapons. These will be available on the criminal market and will create a challenge. No country or region can deal with it in isolation because these groups operate at a global level.” He added: We can expect an influx of weapons in Europe and beyond. We should be alarmed and we have to expect these weapons to be trafficked not only to neighbouring countries but to other continents. He said Interpol urged members to use its database to help “track and trace” the weapons. “We are in contact with member countries to encourage them to use these tools. Criminals are interested in all kinds of weapons … basically any weapons that can be carried might be used for criminal purposes.” Ukraine’s western allies have sent shipments of high-end military weapons to Ukraine since the Russian invasion more than three months ago. On Tuesday, the American president, Joe Biden, announced the US would supply Kyiv with advanced missile systems and munitions. After the US pulled out of Afghanistan in 2021, following 20 years of war, huge amounts of often highly sophisticated military equipment was left behind and fell into the hands of the Taliban. The White House has announced a fresh round of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, targeting Russian government officials and elites close to Vladimir Putin as well as several yachts linked to the president. The sanctions target Russian individuals including Sergei Roldugin, a close associate of Russian president Vladimir Putin who is already under EU sanctions. The treasury department also targeted 16 entities, seven vessels and three aircraft. Among them were two yachts, the “Russia-flagged Graceful and the Cayman Islands-flagged Olympia,” which the treasury identified as “blocked property in which President Vladimir Putin has an interest.” Putin has “taken numerous trips” on the yachts as recently as last year, the treasury said. In his State of the Union address in March, Joe Biden said the US would work to seize the yachts, luxury apartments and private jets of wealthy Russians with ties to Putin. The White House said in a statement that the latest sanctions are designed “to crack down on evasion and tighten our sanctions to enhance enforcement and increase pressure on Putin and his enablers”. The EU has dropped the head of the Russian Orthodox church, Patriarch Kirill, from its new sanctions list, AFP reports. Diplomats are cited as saying that Patriarch Kirill has now been removed from the list of sanctioned individuals, at the request of Hungary. EU leaders agreed in principle earlier this week on a sixth sanctions package against Russia, but several diplomats said Budapest was holding up the finalisation of the package. A press spokesperson for Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, earlier today said Hungary’s opposition to potential EU sanctions against Patriarch Kirill “has been known for a long time”. With Friday marking 100 days since the start of Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February, photographers from Agence France-Press have selected a range of the most striking images to come out of Ukraine from the war. Here is a selection: Russian forces are trying to assault the east Ukrainian village of Berestove that lies on a main road linking the Luhansk region’s city of Lysychansk to the rest of Ukraine, a Ukrainian general has said. Russia is close to capturing all of Luhansk, one of two Ukrainian regions that make up the swathe of land known as the Donbas. Russian forces are also trying to attack the town of Sviatohirsk in the Donetsk region, Reuters reports Gen Oleksiy Gromov told a press briefing. Reuters is reporting that Ukraine would consider switching off its Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant that lies in Russian-occupied territory, if Kyiv loses control of operations at the site. They cite Interfax quoting an aide to Ukraine’s prime minister as saying “As long as the control commands are executed and the site maintains the regime, we are not stopping. But the scenario in which the station could move completely out of control and we stop it is also being looked at.” The facility in southeast Ukraine is Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. About 800 people, including children, are hiding underneath the Azot chemical factory in the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, which has come under intense Russian shelling, according to Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk region. Local residents have sought shelter in the Soviet-era bomb shelters underneath the plant, he told CNN. Haidai said: There are locals there who were asked to leave the city, but they refused. There are also children there, but not many of them. Yesterday, Haidai said it is possible there are still stocks of dangerous chemicals at the facility. In a separate update today, local officials said Russian forces had fired on the Azot factory and “hit one of the administrative buildings and a warehouse where methanol was stored”. Sweden will provide Ukraine with more economic aid and military equipment, including anti-ship missiles, rifles and anti-tank weapons, the Swedish government said. In a statement, Sweden’s finance ministry said: The proposals that are submitted (to parliament) mean that allocated funds for the central government budget will increase by SEK 1.0 billion (£81m) in 2022. The Swedish government “sees a continuing need” to support Ukraine, it added. In February, Sweden announced it would send 5,000 anti-tank weapons, helmets and body armour to Ukraine. The following month, it announced it would send another 5,000 anti-tank weapons. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, will meet the head of the African Union, who is also the Senegalese president, Macky Sall, on Friday to discuss “freeing up stocks of cereals and fertilisers” and the conflict in Ukraine, Sall’s office said. The visit, which will take place in the south-western Russian city of Sochi, was organised after an invitation by Putin, Dakar said. Sall is expected to travel with the president of the African Union Commission. The meeting is aimed at “freeing up stocks of cereals and fertilisers, the blockage of which particularly affects African countries”, along with easing the Ukraine conflict, Sall’s office said. The AU will also receive a video address from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, though no date has been set. Earlier this week, Sall made an appeal to EU leaders to help ease the commodities crisis, which is being acutely felt in African nations. Both Ukraine and Russia are major suppliers of wheat and other cereals to Africa, while Russia is a key producer of fertiliser. Russia’s foreign ministry said the EU’s decision to partially phase out Russian oil was a “self-destructive” step that could backfire on the bloc. On Monday, EU leaders agreed in principle to cut 90% of oil imports from Russia by the end of this year. The move would be likely to destabilise global energy markets, Moscow warned in a statement. Russia’s foreign ministry said: The European Union’s decisions to partially phase out Russian oil and oil products, as well as to ban insurance on Russian merchant ships, are highly likely to provoke further price increases, destabilise energy markets, and disrupt supply chains. Meanwhile, the Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said at his regular briefing that Russia will not sell its oil at a loss. Peskov told reporters: If somewhere demand is falling that means that in another place it is increasing – the flows are re-routed. The Guardian’s economics editor writes for us that the perverse effects of sanctions means rising fuel and food costs for the rest of the world – and fears are growing of a humanitarian catastrophe: It is now three months since the west launched its economic war against Russia, and it is not going according to plan. On the contrary, things are going very badly indeed. Sanctions were imposed on Vladimir Putin not because they were considered the best option, but because they were better than the other two available courses of action: doing nothing or getting involved militarily. The first set of economic measures were introduced immediately after the invasion, when it was assumed Ukraine would capitulate within days. That didn’t happen, with the result that sanctions – while still incomplete – have gradually been intensified. There is, though, no immediate sign of Russia pulling out of Ukraine and that’s hardly surprising, because the sanctions have had the perverse effect of driving up the cost of Russia’s oil and gas exports, massively boosting its trade balance and financing its war effort. In the first four months of 2022, Putin could boast a current account surplus of $96bn (£76bn) – more than treble the figure for the same period of 2021. When the EU announced its partial ban on Russian oil exports earlier this week, the cost of crude oil on the global markets rose, providing the Kremlin with another financial windfall. Russia is finding no difficulty finding alternative markets for its energy, with exports of oil and gas to China in April up more than 50% year on year. That’s not to say the sanctions are pain-free for Russia. The International Monetary Fund estimates the economy will shrink by 8.5% this year as imports from the west collapse. Russia has stockpiles of goods essential to keep its economy going, but over time they will be used up. But Europe is only gradually weaning itself off its dependency on Russian energy, and so an immediate financial crisis for Putin has been averted. The rouble – courtesy of capital controls and a healthy trade surplus – is strong. The Kremlin has time to find alternative sources of spare parts and components from countries willing to circumvent western sanctions. When the global movers and shakers met in Davos last week, the public message was condemnation of Russian aggression and renewed commitment to stand solidly behind Ukraine. But privately, there was concern about the economic costs of a prolonged war. Read Larry Elliott’s full opinion piece: Russia is winning the economic war - and Putin is no closer to withdrawing troops Russian forces are this morning shelling the village of Mykolaivka, close to the strategic city of Sloviansk in the eastern Donbas region. Serhiy Leshchenko, a Ukrainian government adviser and volunteer, said artillery rounds were hitting the settlement “24/7”. Video shows the whine of a Russian missile landing close by, amid deserted streets. Leshchenko was delivering food, flak jackets and other supplies to soldiers who are holding the line north of Sloviansk against a Russian advance. He joined the humanitarian mission led by Ukrainian MP, Andriy Gerus. Donetsk’s military governor, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said shelling was taking place today across “the whole line of contact” including in Sloviansk, Bakhmut and Avdiyivka, where 3,500 civilians remained. Across the region 340,000 people had stayed in their houses from a pre-invasion total of 1.67m, he said. Russian forces are currently occupying about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address to the Luxembourg parliament. The front lines of battle stretch across more than 1,000km (620 miles), Zelenskiy said, adding: We have to defend ourselves against almost the entire Russian army. All combat-ready Russian military formations are involved in this aggression. He said 100 Ukrainians are dying on a daily basis in eastern Ukraine, and another 450-500 people are wounded. Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said he was “grateful” to the US and its secretary of state, Antony Blinken, for a new $700m weapons package for Ukraine. The new package will include high mobility artillery rocket systems, which can accurately hit targets as far away as 80 km (50 miles). Kuleba tweeted: Advanced American systems will help our brave Armed Forces to defend Ukrainian land from Russian invaders. Yesterday, the US president, Joe Biden, announced the plan to give Ukraine precision HIMARS rocket systems after receiving assurances from Kyiv that it would not use them to hit targets inside Russian territory. In a New York Times article published on Tuesday, Biden said the new weapons package will help Ukraine on the battlefield “and be in the strongest possible position at the negotiating table”. The Kremlin has confirmed that Valentin Yumashev, the son-in-law of former Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, has quit his role as an adviser to Vladimir Putin. Yumashev was an unpaid adviser with a limited influence on Putin’s decision-making, Reuters reports. But he did represent one of the last links inside the Putin administration to Yeltsin’s rule, a period of liberal reforms and Russia’s opening up towards the west. Under Yeltsin, who was Russian president from 1991 to 1999, Yumashev served as a Kremlin adviser and later as Kremlin chief of staff. He is married to Yeltsin’s daughter, Tatyana. Despite a divergence in values between the two Russian leaders, Putin has kept ties to the former first family. In March, another senior Yeltsin-era figure, Anatoly Chubais, left his role as a special envoy to the Kremlin. Referring to Yumashev, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today: I can confirm that about a month ago he stopped being an advisor on a voluntary basis. The Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has claimed 243 children have been killed so far in the war and 200,000 children have been forcefully taken to Russia, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families. Speaking in relation to children take to Russia, he said: “The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return.” In her first public speech since leaving office about six months ago, Angela Merkel has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as a “barbaric war of aggression” which amounted to a “far-reaching turning point”. She said whilst she was reluctant to give her views from the sidelines as the former German chancellor, she could not avoid talking about the most “glaring breach of international law” in the history of Europe since the end of the second world war. Russia has taken control of most of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sieverodonetsk, the UK ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The report adds: “The main road into the Sieverodonetsk pocket likely remains under Ukrainian control but Russia continues to make steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery.” The chief spokesman for Russia’s ministry of defence, Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, has claimed that the number of foreign mercenaries fighting for Ukraine has halved since the the start of the war, due to Russian high-precision strikes and their own poor training. He also had a warning for those still fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine, saying “Let me remind you that in accordance with international humanitarian law, mercenaries are not combatants and the best that awaits them is criminal liability.️” The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic claims to have 222 settlements are under their control. They claim overnight ten areas of Donetsk were shelled by Ukrainian forces, and that one person was killed and 19 more were injured. Foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Ukraine is working with international partners to create a United Nations-backed mission to restore Black Sea shipping routes and export Ukrainian farm produce. Slovakia will deliver eight self-propelled Zuzana 2 howitzers to Ukraine under a commercial contract which a state-controlled producer signed, the Slovak Defence Ministry has said. Ukraine’s football victory over Scotland in their Fifa World Cup playoff semi-final last night gave the country, in the words of Zelenskiy, “two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.” The US announced yesterday it will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here shortly. Reuters reports Ukraine is working with international partners to create a United Nations-backed mission to restore Black Sea shipping routes and export Ukrainian farm produce. “We call on countries whose food security may suffer more from Russian aggression against Ukraine to use their contacts with Moscow to force it to lift the blockade of Ukrainian seaports and end the war,” foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said on Facebook. Russia has captured some of Ukraine’s biggest seaports and its navy controls major transport routes in the Black Sea, blocking Ukrainian shipments and deepening a global food crisis. Ukraine’s football victory last night gave the country, in the words of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, “two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed”. After the match, Ukraine’s manager Oleksandr Petrakov gave an emotional press conference, dedicating the victory to the troops who are defending their country against attacks from Russia. In her first public speech since leaving office about six months ago, Angela Merkel has described Russia’s war on Ukraine as a “barbaric war of aggression” which amounted to a “far-reaching turning point”. She said whilst she was reluctant to give her views from the sidelines as the former German chancellor, she could not avoid talking about the most “glaring breach of international law” in the history of Europe since the end of the second world war. Speaking at a gathering of German trade unionists in Berlin on Wednesday night, Merkel said: “My solidarity goes out to Ukraine which has been attacked and raided by Russia”. She said there was no doubt as to Ukraine’s right to self defence. Merkel did not respond to the widespread criticism both at home and abroad particularly since the start of the invasion over her own central role whilst in government towards establishing the now defunct Nord Stream II gas pipeline, of reinforcing Germany’s reliance on Russian energy or for failing to recognise the extent of the ambitions of Russian president Vladimir Putin. The chief spokesman for Russia’s ministry of defence has claimed that the number of foreign mercenaries fighting for Ukraine has halved since the the start of the war, due to Russian high-precision strikes and their own poor training. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov said: Hundreds of foreign mercenaries in Ukraine were destroyed by Russian high-precision long-range weapons shortly after their arrival at the places where they underwent additional training and coordination of tactical units. But most of the mercenaries were destroyed in the combat zone due to the low level of training and lack of real combat experience. The quotes are being carried by Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency, and were repeated in the ministry of defence’s daily briefing. Konashenkov has also claimed, without evidence, that the foreign mercenaries were being treated as canon fodder by Ukrainian forces, and that many have been killed without their families being informed, saying: I would like to draw your attention to the fact that the commanders of the units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the National Guard, which included mercenaries, in an effort to reduce the loss of their military personnel, do not spare foreigners. Captured mercenaries tell during interrogations that they are sacrificed in the first place. Due to silence on loss by the Kyiv regime, and the absence of remains, the relatives of mercenaries in their countries of residence simply do not know about their death. Konashenkov also had a warning for those still fighting as mercenaries in Ukraine, saying: Faced with a real combat situation and heavy losses … a significant number of mercenaries prefer to leave the territory of Ukraine as soon as possible, but the Kyiv regime in every possible way prevents them from leaving abroad.️ Let me remind you that in accordance with international humanitarian law, mercenaries are not combatants and the best that awaits them is criminal liability.️ Emergency attempts by the Kyiv regime to guarantee legal protection to mercenaries, including [to enlist them] in military units of the Armed Forces of Ukraine or the National Guard, or issuing them fresh passports of citizens of Ukraine, will not save any of them. Etienne de Poncins, the French ambassador to Ukraine, has been visiting Hostomel in the Kyiv region. It was the scene of heavy fighting in the earliest days of the war, where it appeared that Russia’s main military thrust was south from Belarus towards Ukraine’s capital. He tweeted “Together with national guard commander Lebid in Hostomel, the scene of fierce fighting, which stopped the aggressor capturing Kyiv. A tribute to the heroic courage of the defenders who are fighting for freedom and their homeland.” The official Telegram channel of Ukraine’s Mariupol authority has again posted accusations of war crimes being committed by pro-Russian occupation forces since they took full control of the city after the surrender of Ukrainian troops at the Azovstal steel plant. They say: In the Mariupol district, the occupiers imprison and shoot Ukrainian volunteers and officials. All of them refused to cooperate with collaborators and the occupation authorities. The fake Donetsk People’s Republic court sentenced the head of one of the Azov villages to ten years in prison. At least one civil servant was executed by firing squad. Dozens of volunteers are also being held in the Olenivka prison. In March-April, they helped evacuate Mariupol residents and tried to deliver food and water to the blocked city. A Ukrainian judge, who has heard several high-profile separatist cases, is also awaiting the verdict of the fake republic. There are reports of torture. The claims have not been independently verified. The headquarters of the territorial defence of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic have issued their daily operational briefing for today. They claim “222 settlements are under our control”. They say that 10 areas of Donetsk were shelled by Ukrainian forces, and that one person was killed and 19 more were injured. They claim “32 housing constructions were damaged, as well as 19 civil infrastructure facilities”. The claims have not been independently verified. Our Luke Harding is in Kyiv, and has been gathering reaction to Ukraine’s victory last night over Scotland in their men’s football world cup playoff semi-final: Bars and restaurants in Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities were unable to show the match because of a wartime curfew. Instead fans watched at home, as well as from bomb shelters and trenches. After the final whistle Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, sent a message of congratulations to the team. “There are times when you don’t need a lot of words! Just pride! Just thank you guys! Two hours of happiness to which we are not accustomed.” On Thursday the mood in Kyiv was upbeat, as the city digested the result amid summer sunshine. “We want to show the world that Ukraine is strong everywhere, including in football,” Vasily Volodymyrovich said, standing guard with a Kalashnikov in the capital. “We have a very strong collective. And we have a great spirit. It was an impressive group victory.” “It was great entertainment – I always thought Ukraine would win,” Oksana, a 24-year-old receptionist, said. She described Artem Dovbyk’s cool stoppage time finish for Ukraine’s third goal as “amazing”, adding: “Of course we will beat Wales.” Read more of Luke Harding’s report from Kyiv here: ‘Great spirit’: jubilant Ukrainians savour football win on streets of Kyiv Slovakia will deliver eight self-propelled Zuzana 2 howitzers to Ukraine under a commercial contract which a state-controlled producer signed, the Slovak Defence Ministry has said. Reuters reports the Zuzana 2 howitzer, a modernised version of an older model, is using 155mm rounds and has an effective range of 40 km (25 miles) to more than 50 km (30 miles) depending on the ammunition type. Russia’s advance on Sievierodonetsk can be more easily understood in the graphics below. Russia has taken control of most of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sieverodonetsk, the UK ministry of defence has said in its latest intelligence report. The report, released just before 7am GMT, adds: The main road into the Sieverodonetsk pocket likely remains under Ukrainian control but Russia continues to make steady local gains, enabled by a heavy concentration of artillery.” However, this has “not been without cost” and Russian forces have sustained losses in the process, the ministry said. Crossing the Siverskyy Donets River - which is a natural barrier to its axes of advance – is “vital for Russian forces” as they secure the regions of Luhansk and prepare to switch focus to Donetsk. Potential crossing sites include between Sieverodonetsk and the neighbouring town of Lysychansk; and near recently-captured Lyman. In both locations, the river line likely still remains controlled by Ukrainian forces, who have destroyed existing bridges. It is likely Russia will need at least a short tactical pause to re-set for opposed river crossings and subsequent attacks further into Donetsk, where Ukrainian armed forces have prepared defensive positions, according to UK officials. However, to do so “risks losing some of the momentum they have built over the last week”. The US earlier confirmed it will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon said. Ukraine promised Washington it will not use the rocket systems to hit targets inside Russian territory. However, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters: We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.” Lavrov later told a news conference in Saudi Arabia: It is a direct provocation (by Ukraine), aimed at involving the West in military action.” Ukraine has commemorated the 243 children killed in Russia’s war with a creative display in the western city of Lviv. The interactive event, titled ‘excursion that will never happen’, used empty school buses and stuffed toys strapped into seats as a symbol of 243 Ukrainian children killed during Russian attacks. ‘Caution! Children!’ signs littering the streets read. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed 243 children have been killed so far in the war and 200,000 children have been forcefully taken to Russia, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families. Zelenskiy made note of International Children’s Day during his nightly video address to the nation on Wednesday, claiming 243 children have been killed, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. Speaking in relation to the 200,000 children believed to have been forcefully taken to Russia, he said: The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return. “Ukraine cannot be conquered, that our people will not surrender and our children will not become the property of the occupiers.” Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I will be brining you all the latest developments until my colleague, Martin Belam, takes the reins a little later on. Here is a comprehensive run-down of where things currently stand. The US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more.

The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov added: “We believe that the United States is purposefully and diligently adding fuel to the fire.” The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. Following Biden’s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems, which will be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday, Politico cited a source as saying. Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. “Unfortunately, today, Russian troops control most of the city,” Serhiy Gaidai said, adding that a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. Western officials said Ukraine’s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed is “pretty credible”. A Russian missile hit rail lines in the western Lviv region, a key conduit for supplies of western weapons and other supplies, officials said. Lviv regional governor Maksym Kozytskiy said five people were wounded in the strike. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. Russia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound. Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces. Denmark has voted overwhelmingly to join the EU’s common defence policy, becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters backed the government’s proposal by 66.9% to 33.1%, followed historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly," to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That’s all from me, Samantha Lock, for now. Please join me a little a later when we launch our new live blog covering all the latest developments from Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has claimed 200,000 children are among the Ukrainians who have been forcefully taken to Russia, including children from orphanages, children taken with their parents and those separated from their families. Zelenskiy made note of International Children’s Day during his nightly video address to the nation on Wednesday, claiming 243 children have been killed so far in the war, 446 have been wounded and 139 are missing. The purpose of this criminal policy is not just to steal people but to make those who are deported forget about Ukraine and unable to return. “Ukraine cannot be conquered, that our people will not surrender and our children will not become the property of the occupiers.” Russian forces now control more than two-thirds of the key eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk. Serhiy Gaidai said a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant while the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk, said Ukrainian forces are holding just 20% of the city, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said. Residents of the eastern city of Sloviansk in the Donetsk region fear a full Russian assault after their city came under rocket attack late on Tuesday. The missiles struck a residential area, damaging and burning nearby vehicles. According to the regional governor, at least three people were killed and six were wounded in the eastern Donetsk region. It’s 2am in Kyiv. Here’s where things stand: Brazilian football legend Pele on Wednesday called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his army’s invasion of Ukraine, as the war-torn country’s national team was set to vie for a World Cup spot. Pele recalled meeting Putin in the past and exchanging “smiles accompanied by a long handshake.” “The power to stop this conflict is in your hands. The same ones I shook in Moscow, at our last meeting in 2017,” he wrote. The match in Glasgow is the first for the Ukrainian national team since the invasion began. A regional governor in western Ukraine said a Russian airstrike on transport infrastructure wounded two people Wednesday. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. The Senate of Ireland passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the Russian invasion of Ukraine a “genocide.” “The acts carried out by the Russian military meet the criteria for genocide set out in the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and as such, the illegal invasion of Ukraine by by the Russian Federation is an act of genocide,” the resolution stated. Denmark has voted to join the EU’s defence policy. Wednesday’s referendum signals the latest shift among Nordic countries to deepen defence ties in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Denmark was the only EU member that was not part of the bloc’s defence and security policy, after the country secured several exemptions in a 1993 referendum. The Ukraine Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights and Children’s Rehabilitation announced on Wednesday that over 234,000 Ukrainian children have been deported since the war began. “According to open sources, as of today, more than 234,000 children have crossed the border to Russia and temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. These are forcibly deported, forcibly displaced children either to the temporarily occupied territories, or to Russia or the Republic of Belarus,” the commissioner said. The head of Interpol raised alarms on Wednesday about a possible uptick in weapons trafficking once the war in Ukraine end. Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock told the Anglo-American Press Association that he has “no doubt” illegal arms trafficking will increase. Stock encouraged Interpol’s 195-member countries to “intensively use available databases that can help trace and track weapons, for instance those stolen in another country.” The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that the US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region of its country. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. That’s it from me, Maya Yang, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in Australia, Samantha Lock. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Brazilian football legend Pele called Wednesday for Russian President Vladimir Putin to end his army’s invasion of Ukraine, as the war-torn country’s national team was set to vie for a World Cup spot, Agence France-Presse reports. “Today Ukraine tries to forget, at least for 90 minutes, the tragedy that still engulfs their country,” Pele wrote in an open letter to Putin, posted on Instagram just before the Ukrainian men’s football team faced Scotland in a World Cup playoff semi-final. “I want to use today’s match as an opportunity to make a request: stop the invasion. There is absolutely no justification for this continued violence,” added the three-time World Cup champion. “This conflict is wicked, unjustifiable and brings nothing but pain, fear, terror and anguish... Wars only exist to separate nations, and there’s no ideology that justifies projectile missiles burying the dreams of children, ruining families and killing the innocent.” Pele recalled meeting Putin in the past and exchanging “smiles accompanied by a long handshake.” “The power to stop this conflict is in your hands. The same ones I shook in Moscow, at our last meeting in 2017,” he wrote. Considered by many the greatest footballer of all time, Pele had one of the most storied careers in sport, scoring more than 1,000 goals before retiring in 1977. His message comes as the Ukraine conflict nears its 100th day, with fierce fighting ongoing in the nation’s east, after the Russian army failed in its bid to overtake Kyiv. The match in Glasgow is the first for the Ukrainian national team since the invasion began. The winners will face Wales on Sunday to decide who will be the final member of Group B - alongside England, the United States and Iran. A regional governor in western Ukraine said a Russian airstrike on transport infrastructure wounded two people Wednesday, the Associated Press reports. Lviv region Gov. Maksym Kozytskyy didn’t name the target of the Russian strike near the city of Lviv. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the country’s interior minister, said the Russians hit the Beskidy railway tunnel in the Carpathian Mountains in an apparent effort to cut a key railway link and disrupt shipments of weapons and fuel. The Lviv region has served as a key conduit for supplies of Western weapons and other supplies. The Senate of Ireland passed a resolution on Wednesday declaring the Russian invasion of Ukraine a “genocide.” “The acts carried out by the Russian military meet the criteria for genocide set out in the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, and as such, the illegal invasion of Ukraine by by the Russian Federation is an act of genocide,” the resolution stated. Denmark will join the European Union’s defence policy after a referendum on Wednesday, public broadcaster DR projected, signalling the latest shift among Nordic countries to deepen defence ties in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Reuters reports. Denmark is the only EU member that is not part of the bloc’s defence and security policy, after the country secured several exemptions in a 1993 referendum. Preliminary results by DR showed 66.6% of voters were in favour of removing an opt-out to the EU’s so-called Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP). Almost 34 percent of voters polled were opposed, but the outcome will not change, according to DR. “It is a completely new approach to Europe, that we are signalling to our European allies, to the whole world,” said former foreign minister and member of the Social Liberal Party, Martin Lidegaard. “It can hardly be overestimated, the importance it has on our foreign and European policy,” Lidegaard said. In the CSDP Denmark would be able to take part in joint military operations, such as those in Somalia, Mali and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to cooperate on acquisition of joint military capabilities. “The United States has said it very clearly. Europe must be more responsible for security, and I think it makes good sense to be part of that cooperation instead of constantly hoping for the U.S. to come,” said Conservative People’s Party leader Soren Pape. Daria Herasymchuk, the Ukraine Presidential Commissioner for Children’s Rights and Children’s Rehabilitation announced on Wednesday that over 234,000 Ukrainian children have been deported since the war began. “According to open sources, as of today, more than 234,000 children have crossed the border to Russia and temporarily occupied territories of Luhansk and Donetsk oblasts. These are forcibly deported, forcibly displaced children either to the temporarily occupied territories, or to Russia or the Republic of Belarus,” Herasymchuk said. “We will fight for absolutely every Ukrainian child. Today we can also say that the world of adults has failed Children’s Day in Ukraine,” she added. The head of Interpol, an international organization that that facilitates worldwide police cooperation and crime control, raised alarms on Wednesday about a possible uptick in weapons trafficking once the war in Ukraine ends, the Associated Press reports. Interpol Secretary-General Jurgen Stock told the Anglo-American Press Association that he has “no doubt” illegal arms trafficking will increase. “We have seen that in the Balkans region,” Stock said. “We have seen that in theaters in Africa that, of course, organized crime groups try to exploit this chaotic situation, availability of weapons and even weapons that are used by the military.” Small weapons are the main concern, he said. Stock encouraged Interpol’s 195-member countries to “intensively use available databases that can help trace and track weapons, for instance those stolen in another country.” “No country in our region can deal with it in isolation because the criminals I’m talking about are operating globally,” Stock said. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, does not carry out investigations but provides training for police and customs officers to, for instance, identify trafficking routes, Stock said. The Pentagon announced on Wednesday that the US will send Ukraine four sophisticated, medium-range rocket systems and ammunition to help try to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region of its country, the Associated Press reports. It will take at least three weeks to get the precision weapons and trained troops onto the battlefield, the Pentagon added. The rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that also includes helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, radars, tactical vehicles, spare parts and more. Asked if the weapons are arriving too late to make a difference, as Russia makes progress in the east and south, Colin Kahl, the defense undersecretary for policy, said he doesn’t think so. “It is a grinding fight,” he said during a Pentagon briefing. “We believe that these additional capabilities will arrive in a timeframe that’s relevant and allow the Ukrainians to very precisely target the types of things they need for the current fight.” The Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Wednesday that the US is “deliberately and diligently pouring fuel on the fire.” He added that the Kremlin doesn’t trust Kyiv’s assurances that the multiple rocket launch systems supplied by the US will not be used to attack Russia. “In order to trust [someone], you need to have experience with situations when such promises were kept. Regretfully, there is no such experience whatsoever,” Peskov said. It’s the 11th package approved so far and will be the first to tap the $40bn in security and economic assistance recently passed by Congress. The rocket systems would be part of Pentagon drawdown authority, so would involve taking weapons from US inventory and getting them into Ukraine quickly. Ukrainian troops would also need training on the new systems, which could take at least a week or two. Officials said the plan is to send Ukraine the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, or Himars, which is mounted on a truck and can carry a container with six rockets. The system can launch a medium-range rocket, which is the current plan, but is also capable of firing a longer-range missile, the Army Tactical Missile System, which has a range of about 190 miles and is not part of the plan. It’s 9pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. Blinken’s remarks came after the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. Following Biden’s announcement, the UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems this morning, which will be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday, Politico cited a source as saying. During a joint news conference with Blinken, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. The regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai, said a number of civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian forces are holding just 20% of the city, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, according to the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a western official said. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. Western officials said Ukraine’s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed is “pretty credible”. Russia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound. Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, today as I hand the blog over to my colleague in New York, Maya Yang. I’ll be back tomorrow, thank you. Civilians are sheltering from Russian shelling under a chemical plant in the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk, according to the regional governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Gaidai. It is possible there are still stocks of dangerous chemicals at the facility, Gaidai told Reuters. Referring to the siege of the Azovstal steel plant in the southern port city of Mariupol, Gaidai said: There are civilians there in bomb shelters, there are quite a few of them, but it will not be a second Azovstal as that [plant] had a huge underground city – which isn’t there at Azot. Jasper Jolly speaks to Yuriy Ryzhenkov, whose Azovstal plant was devastated by Russian bombardment: The Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol has become one of the symbols of the brutality of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Soldiers held out for weeks in the warren of tunnels, warehouses and cooling blast furnaces as they and hundreds of civilians sheltering with them were encircled and eventually forced to surrender. The site produced 40% of Ukraine’s entire steel output and was the key asset of the country’s biggest pre-war employer, Metinvest. Now its owner has an important role to play in the parallel battle to sustain the economy via its other plants outside occupied territory, according to its chief executive, Yuriy Ryzhenkov. “The war effort is not only what you supply to the army, but also how [the] economy functions,” the Metinvest boss says, speaking via videolink from a company office in Lviv, western Ukraine. “So the better the economy functions, the better the country can fight a war. In our view, in my personal view the people who are now at our steel mills are just as important to the victory of Ukraine as the soldiers on the frontline. Ryzhenkov was in the capital, Kyiv, when he first heard Russian weaponry signalling the start of the invasion and was stunned that Vladimir Putin’s regime would launch open warfare. The company has since adjusted to operating in a warzone, but at least 153 Metinvest employees have died in the fighting. Beyond keeping money flowing through the economy, the metals and mining group is playing a direct role in the war effort, delivering steel for 1,500 bulletproof vests a week to Ukraine’s armed forces, and importing military equipment such as drones, night-vision headsets and helmets. It is a remarkable shift for a company whose main shareholder – Ukraine’s richest man, Rinat Akhmetov – was as recently as November cited by the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, as a target to be recruited to back a possible coup attempt. Zelenskiy said Akhmetov was not involved in the plot, and the oligarch said claims of moves to draw him in were “an absolute lie”. Read Jasper Jolly’s full article – Boss of devastated Azovstal plant: ‘Steel is as key to Ukraine’s victory as soldiers’ The UK has reportedly asked the US to sign off on a plan to send advanced, medium-range rocket systems to Ukraine within a few weeks, following President Joe Biden’s announcement that he will send similar weapons. Britain’s prime minister, Boris Johnson, spoke with Biden about the transfer of US-made M270 multiple launch rocket systems this morning, Politico reports, citing a person familiar with the matter. The meeting will then be followed by a discussion between his foreign secretary, Liz Truss, and the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, on Thursday, the source said. The UK would be the first country to send the US-made MLRS, the news site reports. The US must officially approve the move due to export regulations. Interpol’s secretary general, Jürgen Stock, has warned that many of the weapons being sent to Ukraine will eventually wind up in criminal hands in Europe and beyond. Stark urged countries to start scrutinising arms-tracking databases, telling reporters: The high availability of weapons during the current conflict will result in the proliferation of illicit arms in the post-conflict phase. Organised crime groups will be empowered by the availability of weapons, he said. Criminals are already now, here as we speak, focusing on that. Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he will convene a meeting in Brussels in the coming days with senior officials from Sweden, Finland and Turkey to discuss Turkey’s opposition to Sweden and Finland joining the alliance. Speaking at a joint news conference with the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, Stoltenberg said: I’m in close contact with President Erdoğan of Turkey and with the leaders of Finland and Sweden. Blinken said there was a “strong consensus within Nato, broadly, to support the rapid accession of Sweden and Finland” to Nato and he was confident it would happen. It is almost 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy said in an interview with the US Newsmax television channel. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. Blinken’s remarks came after the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. Lavrov’s deputy, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively” and that it would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Ukrainian forces are holding just 20% of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, according to the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, said earlier this morning that Russia controls 70% of the city. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a Western official said. Russia said it has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound. Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Scholz said Germany had been “delivering continuously since the beginning of the war” and said talks were continuing with Germany’s partners on ways to further arm Ukraine against the Russian attack. Fuel believed to be partially made from Russian crude has reportedly reached US shores despite a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy. Traders are attempting to evade US sanctions by obscuring the origins of Russian oil, concealing the oil in blended refined products such as gasoline, diesel and chemicals, the Wall Street Journal reports. Hello. I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. As always, feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. The expected loss of Sievierodonetsk “is unlikely to be the crux” of Russia’s Donbas campaign, a Western official said, in a war that could now grind on “to the end of the year” given the slow rate of Moscow’s advance. The average gain of Russian forces in Popansa south of Sievierodonetsk has “averaged between 500m and 1 kilometre” a day in the last month, the official added, meaning capturing the remainder of the Donetsk region in the Donbas would take months more at least. Russia would have to achieve “further challenging operational objectives” to declare victory on the Kremlin’s now reduced campaign terms, the official said. That would require taking the city of Kramatorsk, more of the M04 main road between the Ukrainian-held city of Dnipro and the Russian-held city of Donetsk, they added, and more rivers would have to be crossed in the process. The official said in a briefing: Although we see Russia is starting to learn from its mistakes and make advances in the Donbas, I think it’s important to stress that the battle for Sievierodonetsk is is unlikely to be the kind of the crux of the Donetsk campaign. Russian casualty rates were dropping because of the increasingly concentrated fighting in the Donbas, and were probably “not necessarily significantly more” than a previous estimate of 15,000 killed given in April. The number of Russians wounded, since the war began, is estimated at about 40,000. The west believes that Ukraine’s estimate that it is losing 60 to 100 troops a day killed in the current fighting is “pretty credible” although troop morale remains far higher than the invaders, where the official argued there was “growing disillusionment” with Russia’s slow-moving campaign among junior soldiers and more senior ranks. Russia may slow down its offensive after capturing Sievierodonetsk to regroup, in what could amount to a pause. The official said it was unlikely the Russian invaders would be “in a position to continue to exploit immediately” once the city, the last held by Ukraine in the Luhansk region, fell. Instead, Moscow’s forces could be forced into “a kind of an operational pause” to “reconstitute and resupply”, they said. The US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has been speaking at a joint news conference with Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, where he said Ukraine has given “assurances” that it will not use long-range weapons systems provided by Washington against targets on Russian territory. The new weapons package heading to Ukraine is “precisely what they need” and will strengthen their hand at any negotiations in the future, he said. Regarding concerns about Russia interpreting the weapons package to Ukraine as escalatory, Blinken said that the US president, Joe Biden, had been clear with his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, about the consequences of the Russian invasion. Blinken said: There was no hiding the ball. We’ve been extremely clear about this from day one with President Biden communicating that directly to President Putin. So we have done exactly what we said we would do. He said Putin had wanted less Nato but instead, “he is getting more Nato, more troops and more members”. The US cannot predict how long the conflict will continue, Blinken continued, but it will make sure Ukraine is equipped w",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
th what it needs to defend itself effectively. Blinken said: We can’t predict how this is going to play out, when this is going to play out. As best we can assess right now, we are still looking at many months of conflict. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said the supply of US advanced rocket systems to Ukraine increases the risk of a “third country” being dragged into the conflict. His remarks came after the US president, Joe Biden, confirmed he will send more medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems to Ukraine as part of a new weapons package to be unveiled today. Speaking at a news conference in Saudi Arabia, Lavrov also said Russia is facing difficulties exporting grain due to sanctions against its ships, Reuters reports. Lavrov said: There are also problems with the export of Russian grain... Vessels that carry Russian grain have fallen under sanctions. About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed and 40,000 wounded since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, western officials have estimated. Our Dan Sabbagh writes that Russia’s previously high casualty rate has dropped significantly since its focus of attack has narrowed. Officials have also supported Ukraine’s count that its forces are losing between 60 and 100 soldiers each day in the battle in the Donbas. Denmark is voting on whether to join the EU’s common defence policy, potentially becoming the last of the bloc’s members to sign up as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues to reshape Europe’s security landscape. The referendum on Wednesday, in which voters are thought likely to back the government’s proposal, follows historic applications by Denmark’s previously non-aligned Nordic neighbours, Finland and Sweden, to join Nato last month. Denmark, historically critical of the EU, secured exemptions from joining both the bloc’s security and defence policy and the euro in a 1993 referendum, but the country’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said it was time to change tack. “Unfortunately we are looking forward to a time that will be even more unstable than what we are experiencing now,” Frederiksen said after casting her vote. I believe it is the right thing for Europe, the right thing for Denmark, the right thing for our future. Frederiksen called the referendum barely two weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine after reaching an agreement with a majority of parties in the Danish parliament, also pledging to increase defence spending to 2% of GDP, in line with Nato membership requirements, by 2033. The US military is conducting offensive hacking operations in support of Ukraine, according to the head of US cyber command, Gen Paul Nakasone. US military hackers have “conducted a series of operations” in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Nakasone confirmed in an interview with Sky News. Nakasone said: We’ve conducted a series of operations across the full spectrum; offensive, defensive, [and] information operations. He did not detail the activities but said they were lawful, conducted with civilian oversight of the military and through US defence department policy. He also said he is concerned “every single day” about the risk of a Russian cyber attack targeting the US and said “hunt forward” operations were allowing the US to search out foreign hackers and identify their tools before they were used against America. There has been another Telegram update from Serhiy Haidai, governor of Luhansk, this time with what he says is good news – a successful evacuation. He posted: The mountain community suffers daily from enemy shelling, the racists level the settlements with artillery and aircraft. The hottest in Toshkivka and Zolote, orcs [a slang term for Russian forces] deliberately roam the high-rises. It was extremely difficult to drive, the road is constantly under fire, but our heroes broke through – brought in ambulances and evacuated nine people – retirees and people with limited mobility. Haidai goes on to claim that the people are now safe. A Ukrainian MP has warned of an impending famine if action is not taken to unblock the country’s ports and release millions of tonnes of grain. PA Media reports Kira Rudik, leader of the liberal Voice party, was speaking to journalists at the Scottish Parliament. “Before the war, Ukraine was top three of the countries producing grains: wheat, sunflower oil, tomatoes and corn,” Rudik said. Exports that could feed the rest of the world, the MP said, were stuck in ports in Ukraine with “no way of getting them out”. “In 10 weeks, we are facing famine, especially for countries in the [global] south. We need a unified approach to help unblock our ports and help get all this harvest out.” Rudik said she raised the issue in a meeting with Westminster Conservative MP, Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, adding: “This is a humanitarian mission that needs to happen, not for the Ukrainian good but for the good of the whole world.” Rudik was interviewed by our defence and security editor Dan Sabbagh earlier in the week: Ukrainian MP urges west to supply long-range rockets or risk Russian victory The UN’s secretary general, António Guterres, said he was hopeful of easing the food crisis prompted by the war in Ukraine, but warned that “we are not yet there” in terms of reaching any agreement to unblock shipments of commodities such as grain. Speaking at a news conference with Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, in Stockholm, Guterres said: I think that there is progress, but we are not yet there. These are complex things and the fact that everything is interlinked makes the negotiation particularly complex. Guterres has been attempting to broker what he calls a package deal to resume both Ukrainian food exports and Russian food and fertiliser exports. He said: As I said to the security council, I’m hopeful, but there is still a ways to go and we are totally committed to make things happen. Ukrainian forces are holding just 20% of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk, the largest still held by Kyiv in the Luhansk region, according to the Ukrainian head of the city administration, Oleksandr Stryuk. There is still hope, however, that Ukrainian forces can prevent Russia from taking full control of the city, he said. Russian forces now control 60% of the city while the rest has become “no-man’s land”, Stryuk told Reuters. Stryuk said: The 20% is being fiercely defended by our armed forces. Our troops are holding defensive lines. Attempts are being made to drive out the Russian troops. We have hope that despite everything we will free the city and not allow it to be completely occupied Earlier today, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, Serhiy Haidai, said Russia now “controls 70% of Sievierodonetsk” and that Ukrainian troops had “retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions”. Between 12,000 to 13,000 people remain in the city and it was impossible to get food or aid in or to get people out, Stryuk said. There was no information on how many people have died in the city in recent days, he added. Residents of Sievierodonetsk, Luhansk, were told yesterday to remain in bomb shelters after a strike on a chemical factory created a toxic cloud. This footage shows brown plumes of gas ascending after a container with chemicals was blown up at the Azot chemical works. The factory, one of Ukraine’s biggest chemical works, employs about 7,000 people. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has conceded that Kyiv’s forces are currently suffering up to 100 fatalities and 500 wounded every day. In an interview with the US Newsmax television channel that aired yesterday, Zelenskiy said: The situation is very difficult; we’re losing 60-100 soldiers per day as killed in action and something around 500 people as wounded in action. So we are holding our defensive perimeters. The most difficult situation is in the east of Ukraine and southern Donetsk and Luhansk, Zelenskiy added. Ukraine and its people are the “defensive perimeter” for the world against Vladimir Putin’s aggression, he told the channel. We have to realise who is the dark power: it’s Russia. And Russia is not going to stop in Ukraine, for sure. The other countries, the former Republics of USSR and the members of the EU – some of them are already Nato member nations – they’re already under threat. The Ukrainian president called out the “weakness” of Putin and Russia, not only in failing to occupy a smaller neighbouring nation but also in attempts to take him out as leader. He said: Attempting to kill the leader of this or that country is a weakness, I would say. If you can’t talk, then it’s a weakness. Putin cannot win, and the world must stop defending him amid the latest “atrocities” committed by Russian troops, he continued, while also calling out the lack of fully enforcing sanctions. Now, he’s almost isolated. The world always keeps giving him a chance, because the sanctions are not imposed completely. There’s gaps in some of the leaders saying the Russian leader should be offered with a way out. Russian troops have been accused of committing acts of torture against residents in the Russian-controlled Kherson region in southern Ukraine. The BBC has gathered multiple first-hand testimonies from Kherson residents who say they were tortured while in the hands of Russian forces. In one case, Olexander Guz, a deputy in the village of Bilozerka in the Kherson region, said he was left with severe bruising after being beaten. “They put a bag on my head,” he said. The Russians threatened that I would not have kidneys left. Oleh Baturin, a journalist for an independent newspaper in the Kherson region, said he was kidnapped and imprisoned by Russian forces for more than a week. During his imprisonment, he said he heard others being tortured and witnessed a young man’s mock execution. He himself was beaten “on the back, ribs and legs” with “the butt of a machine gun” and suffered four broken ribs. The BBC spoke to a doctor who worked in a hospital in Kherson, who said he has seen signs of electrocution, traces of binding on the hands and strangulation marks on the neck, as well as burns on people’s feet and hands. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has been speaking at his regular conference call with reporters, where he blamed “illegal restrictions” imposed on Russia by western countries for a potential “very deep” food crisis. Russia has been blockading Ukrainian ports but is trying to pin the blame for the lack of grain shipments on western sanctions and on Kyiv itself. Peskov told reporters today: We are potentially on the verge of a very deep food crisis linked to the introduction of illegal restrictions against us and the actions of Ukrainian authorities who have mined the path to the Black Sea and are not shipping grain from there despite Russia not impeding in any way. His remarks come after European leaders appealed to African countries, who are facing “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises, not to fall for the Kremlin’s propaganda campaign that paints the impending global food crisis as the result of western sanctions against Russia. Peskov also warned that the EU’s sanctions on Russian oil would hit the global energy market, but said Moscow could re-route exports to limit its own losses. He did not rule out a meeting between Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, but said talks needed to be prepared in advance. Peskov said work on a peace document with Ukraine had stopped a long time ago and had not restarted. Fuel believed to be partially made from Russian crude reached US shores despite a ban on all imports of Russian oil, gas and energy, according to reports. Traders are attempting to evade US sanctions by obscuring the origins of Russian oil, concealing the oil in blended refined products such as gasoline, diesel and chemicals, the Wall Street Journal reports. The cargoes that landed in New York and New Jersey last month were brought through the Suez Canal and across the Atlantic from Indian refineries, which have been big buyers of Russian oil. One analyst who has been tracking Russian fossil fuel exports and their role in funding the Ukraine war told the paper: It does look like there’s a trade where Russian crude is refined in India and then some of it is sold to the US. Oil is also being transferred between ships at sea in the Mediterranean, off the coast of west Africa and the Black Sea, and then taken toward China, India and western Europe, the paper reports. In March, the US president, Joe Biden, announced that “Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports”. The UK announced a similar move to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of 2022. Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, said that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.” The US president, Joe Biden, has confirmed he will send the more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m (£555m) tranche of security assistance from the US. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.” President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. The UK’s ministry of defence latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine says: “Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine.” Overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow as part of a protest to coincide with International Children’s Day. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, the chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Switzerland’s government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Ukraine is working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued. Russia says it has has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. Ukraine will face Scotland tonight in what is set to be a highly emotionally charged football match in Glasgow. The winners will play Wales on Sunday for the final berth at the 2022 Fifa World Cup in Qatar. That is it from me, Martin Belam, until later on. Léonie Chao-Fong will be here with you shortly. Germany will supply Ukraine with the IRIS-T air defence system, the Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said, following pleas from Kyiv and German opposition parties to step up heavy weapons deliveries. Scholz said Germany had been “delivering continuously since the beginning of the war”, pointing to more than 15m rounds of ammunition,100,000 grenades and more than 5,000 anti-tank mines sent to Ukraine since Russia invaded the country on 24 February. “Most recently, the government has decided that we will deliver the most modern air defence system that Germany has in the form of the IRIS-T,” Reuters reports Scholz told lawmakers in the Bundestag. Responding to critics in his speech to parliament, Scholz said his government had responded to the Russian attack with a “massive change of policy in Germany” by opting to send heavy weapons into a war zone. Ukraine’s requests for heavy weapons intensified in recent weeks when Moscow turned its fiercest firepower on the country’s east after failing to take the capital, Kyiv. Scholz said talks were continuing with Germany’s partners on ways to further arm Ukraine against the Russian attack. Russia says it has has completed testing of its hypersonic Zircon cruise missile and will deploy it before the end of the year on a new frigate of its Northern Fleet. Reuters report Aleksandr Moiseyev, commander of the Northern Fleet, said the Admiral Golovko frigate would become the first to be armed full-time with the Zircon. President Vladimir Putin has described the Zircon as part of a new generation of unrivalled arms systems, travelling at nine times the speed of sound. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has said that Russia now controls 70% of the city of Sievierodonetsk, which is the main crucible of Russia’s attack at the present time, and a key objective if Russian forces are to control the whole of the Donbas region. Haidai posted to Telegram claiming that “the Russians control 70% of Sievierodonetsk. Ukrainian troops retreated to more advantageous, pre-prepared positions. Another part continues fighting inside the city.” He also said: “Lysychansk is completely under Ukrainian control. All free settlements of Luhansk region are constantly under fire. Evacuation is suspended.” Pope Francis appealed to authorities to lift the block on wheat exports from Ukraine, saying the grain cannot be used as a “weapon of war”. Reuters reports that speaking at his general audience to thousands of people in St Peter’s Square, he said the block should be lifted because many millions of people depend on wheat from Ukraine, particularly in the world’s poorest countries. Oleh Synyehubov, Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, has posted to Telegram a situation update. He writes: Kharkiv, Izium, Bohodukhiv and Chuhuiv districts of the region were shelled en masse. As a result of these shellings, four civilians were killed. A woman died in Zolochev, and a 12-year-old boy died in Ivanivka, Izium district. In the village Shestakove, Chuguiv district – two dead. A total of seven civilians were injured. Fighting continues in Kharkiv region. The enemy is focused on defense and trying to hold his ground. In the Izium direction, the Russian occupiers are regrouping and preparing for new offensive attempts. Our defenders hold positions and inflict losses on the enemy. Last night, the Ukrainian armed forces shot down a Russian Ka-52 “Alligator” helicopter. The enemy is acting insidiously, striking at civilians and civilian infrastructure. But he will answer for all his crimes! Ukraine will win! The claims have not been verified. Russia has said that a US decision to supply advanced rocket systems and munitions to Ukraine was extremely negative and would increase the risk of a direct confrontation. Reuters reports that the Russian deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told the state news agency RIA Novosti that Moscow viewed US military aid to Ukraine “extremely negatively”. Ryabkov singled out US plans to supply Kyiv with its high mobility artillery rocket system (Himars) – a multiple rocket launcher system that Washington said it would supply to Ukraine as part of its latest military aid package. “Attempts to present the decision as containing an element of ‘self-restraint’ are useless,” Ryabkov said. “The fact that the United States, at the head of a group of states, is engaged in a purposeful pumping of weapons into the Kyiv regime is an obvious thing.” Russia’s RIA Novosti agency is reporting that overnight a video depicting children alleged to have been killed by Ukrainian forces in the Russian-occupied Donbas region of Ukraine was projected on to the US embassy in Moscow. The agency writes: A video was projected on the walls of the US embassy in Moscow, stating that the US military “bears full responsibility for all the dead children of Donbas”. The activists who organised the action timed it to the International Children’s Day. The performance participants explained that they wanted to remind the world community that the White House has been sponsoring the Ukrainian authorities for many years. Also from last night is this image of Gazprom’s building in Moscow, which is lit up at night with the letter “Z” in support of Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. The Swiss government has vetoed Denmark’s request to send Swiss-made armoured personnel carriers to Ukraine, citing its neutrality policy of not supplying arms to conflict zones, the Swiss broadcaster SRF has reported. The Swiss War Material act requires foreign countries that buy Swiss arms to seek permission to re-export them. Reuters notes that in April Switzerland vetoed the re-export of Swiss-made ammunition used in anti-aircraft tanks that Germany is sending to Ukraine. It has also rejected Poland’s request for arms to help neighbouring Ukraine. There has been some debate about amending the War Material act. With the referendum on whether to join the European Union’s common defence policy today, and the question over gas supplies from Russia, there is a lot of news coming out of Denmark this morning. And there is more – Denmark’s foreign minister, Jeppe Kofod, has said he will ask parliament tomorrow for Denmark’s support of the accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. Before the two nations can formally join, their membership has to be ratified by every current member state, which includes founding member Denmark. Initially this block incorrectly said that Kofod would speak to parliament on Wednesday. It was amended at 8.40am after Reuters issued a correction. Apologies. There is a quick snap from Reuters here about the gas supply situation in Denmark. The Danish system operator Energinet has said that the flow of natural gas to Denmark via Germany remained steady today, despite Gazprom’s decision to halt supplies. Away from the war in their homeland, Ukraine’s men’s football team are competing for a place in this year’s Fifa World Cup in Qatar. Nick Ames writes for us: When Ukraine face Scotland at Hampden Park tonight it will be less a rebirth than a reminder that, much as Russia might wish to erase the country’s cultural identity, its football heritage remains truly alive. The act of playing for a World Cup place on Wednesday night, and over the next five days if all goes well, is both one of defiance and of expectation that, despite everything, good things can lie ahead. Read more here: Ukraine players show their nation’s culture is alive and kicking Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has confirmed on Telegram that again overnight there were no air raid warnings in the region, which is to the west of Ukraine and away from the main Russian theatre of operations. The UK’s ministry of defence has published their latest assessment of the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It says: Russian ground operations remain tightly focused, with the weight of fire power concentrated within a small sector of Luhansk oblast. Over 30-31 May, fighting intensified in the streets of Sievierodonetsk, with Russian forces pushing closer to the town centre. Over half of the town is likely now occupied by Russian forces, including Chechen fighters. Beyond the Donbas, Russia continues to conduct long-range missile strikes against infrastructure across Ukraine. Denmark votes today in a referendum asking the nation whether it wants to end its decades-long opt-out from common European Union defence policies. The referendum was called on 6 March in the wake of Russia’s latest invasion of Ukraine. Agence France-Presse reports that analysts’ predictions of the result have been cautious, given a low voter turnout expected in a country that has often said “no” to further EU integration. Eleven of Denmark’s 14 parties have urged voters to say “yes”, representing more than three-quarters of seats in parliament. “We must always cast our ballots when there is a vote”, prime minister Mette Frederiksen urged Danes in the final televised debate of the campaign on Sunday. “I believe with all my heart that we have to vote ‘yes’. At a time when we need to fight for security in Europe, we need to be more united with our neighbours”, she said. The defence opt-out means the Nato founding member does not participate in EU foreign policy where defence is concerned, and does not contribute troops to EU military missions. Polls close at 8pm local time (7pm BST) with the result expected about three hours later. Ukrainian hospitals are coming under enormous pressure, with trains carrying hundreds of injured people west from the front lines. Associated Press reports from Pokrovsk, where already-strained hospitals are trying to deal with an influx of trauma injuries from eastern cities like Sievierodonetsk, which are under heavy Russian bombing: In wheelchairs and on stretchers, in ambulances and on train station platforms, they wait. Medical workers pull out ramps and wheel the patients onto the specially equipped train that will carry them westwards, away from the fighting raging in eastern Ukraine. The train is a lifeline for the overwhelmed hospitals in cities and towns near Ukraine’s front lines that are struggling to cope with an influx of war wounded on top of their usual flow of sick patients. Some hospitals in the east are buckling under the pressure of growing victim numbers, with already-reduced staff. From Pokrovsk: Before the war “when there was normal work, we had 10 surgeons, now we have five,” said Dr. Ivan Mozhaiev. In his department, the 32-year-old is the only surgeon who remained out of five. 689 children have been injured or killed in Ukraine as a result of the Russian invasion, the Verkhovna Rada - Ukrainian parliament - said this morning, in a post to its official Telegram. As of the morning of June 1, the official number of child victims was 243, and the number of injured was 446. It noted that those figures are not final, as work was still underway to try and confirm deaths in occupied territories and areas with active fighting. The true number is likely much higher: in cities like Sievierodonetsk, the mayor has said it is impossible to keep track of civilian casualties amid round-the-clock shelling. For more insight into why Ukraine has been pleading for arms like the missiles just promised by the US, I recommend our correspondent Luke Harding’s report from Mykolaiv. He spoke there to Ukrainian forces under constant fire, desperate for heavier weaponry. Roman Kostenko, a Ukrainian MP and special forces commander said this: “Victory now depends on our international friends,” he said. “We have plenty of kalashnikovs and machine guns. If we get enough heavy arms Russia will not be able to go any further.” He stressed: “The west can change the outcome of this war.” Reuters reports that Russia’s nuclear forces are holding drills in the Ivanovo province, northeast of Moscow. The report comes from Interfax news agency, citing the Russian defence ministry on Wednesday. Some 1,000 servicemen are exercising in intense manoeuvres using over 100 vehicles including Yars intercontinental ballistic missile launchers, it said. The report came shortly after Biden announced the US would be sending a $700m package of security assistance, including medium range missiles, to Ukraine. Some more detail on the military aid package announced by president Joe Biden: The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of $700m of security assistance for Ukraine from the US that will include helicopters, Javelin anti-tank weapon systems, tactical vehicles and more. Biden said the United States the advanced rocket systems and munitions would allow Ukraine to “more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield”. The US is trying to strike the balance of assisting Ukraine without risking escalating the war further. Senior US administration officials said Ukraine gave assurances the missiles would not be used to strike inside Russia: These systems will be used by the Ukrainians to repel Russian advances on Ukrainian territory, but they will not be used on targets in Russian territory.” Read the full story on that arms package here: Hello. I’m Tess McClure and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. This morning, Joe Biden confirmed he will send more advanced, longer-range rocket systems to Kyiv, a critical weapon that Ukrainian leaders have been asking for as they struggle to stall Russian progress in the Donbas region. The medium-range high mobility artillery rocket systems are part of a new $700m tranche of security assistance from the US. That missiles package is an attempt for the US to strike a balance - providing meaningful assistance, while avoiding escalating the war by providing weapons that could allow strikes deep into Russia. It’s just after 7am in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up or dropping in to catch up on what’s been happening, here are some of the latest developments from overnight: Russian forces now control of most of the eastern city of Sievierodonetsk. Serhiy Gaidai, the local governor, said in an online post late on Tuesday that Russian shelling had made it impossible to deliver humanitarian supplies or evacuate people. Civilians were told to stay underground. President Zelenskiy has blasted the “madness” of bombing a chemical plant in Sievierodonetsk. “Given the presence of large-scale chemical production in Sievierodonetsk, the Russian army’s strikes there, including blind air bombing, are just crazy.” Local officials said a nitric acid tank was hit and posted images of pink smoke billowing. Zelenskiy said Ukraine’s military forces have had some successes near Kherson and in parts of the Kharkiv region. Ukraine welcomed EU sanctions but criticised the “unacceptable” delay. Speaking alongside Slovakia’s President Zuzana Caputova in Kyiv, Zelenskiy noted that 50 days had passed between the fifth and sixth sanction packages. Ukraine was working on an international UN-led operation with naval partners to ensure a safe trade route for food exports, according to Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, who said Russia was playing “hunger games with the world by blocking Ukrainian food exports”. Ukraine’s giant seed bank is in danger of being destroyed. The genetic code for nearly 2,000 crops rests in underground vaults based in Kharkiv, north-eastern Ukraine, which has come under intense bombing. Read more of the Guardian’s coverage how vital seed banks are in the climate crisis here and here. The African Union warned EU leaders that Moscow’s blockade of Ukraine’s ports risked “a catastrophic scenario” of food shortages and price rises. Senegal’s president, Macky Sall, who chairs the union, said “the worst is perhaps ahead of us” if current global food supply trends continued. Ukraine would prosecute 80 suspected war criminals, said the prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova. Representatives of a group of countries investigating Russian war crimes have met with the international criminal court prosecutor, Karim Khan, at The Hague. A senior Russian lawmaker has suggested kidnapping a Nato defence minister. Oleg Morozov from the United Russia party said on Rossiya-1 state TV he had a “fantastical plot” that a Nato war minister would travel to Kyiv and wake up in Moscow. Sanctions against Russia are directed at ordinary citizens and motivated by hatred, the former president, Dmitry Medvedev, has said. Medvedev, who advises Vladimir Putin on national security," said on Telegram that the “endless tango of economic sanctions” won’t touch the political elite but have brought losses for big business. Russia has further cut off gas supplies to Europe. Gazprom turned off the taps to a top Dutch trader and halted flows to some companies in Denmark and Germany. The intensification follows the EU’s decision to place an embargo on most Russian oil imports.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Too late to evacuate civilians in face of Russian attack, says Luhansk official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/24/ukraine-too-late-to-evacuate-civilians-in-face-of-russian-attack-says-luhansk-official,2022-05-24T14:57:37Z,Sievierodonetsk under intense bombardment and surrounded on three sides by Russian forces,"The governor of Luhansk has delivered a warning that it is too late for thousands of civilians to be evacuated from the besieged city of Sievierodonetsk, as it faced an intensive Russian assault to take the city and the parts of the province still held by Ukraine. Surrounded on three sides by Russian forces who have been attempting to complete their encirclement of the pocket around the city, Sievierodonetsk and the towns and villages to its west have been under intense bombardment in recent days. Fifteen thousand residents were still believed to be in the city hiding in shelters from what Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, described as “the largest [offensive] on European soil since the second world war” while a defence ministry spokesman said the war was currently in its “most active phase.” Russian forces have been attempting to cut Ukrainian supply lines to Sievierodonestsk by trying to control key roads to the west. “At this point I will not say: get out, evacuate. Now I will say: stay in a shelter,” Sergiy Haidai said on his Telegram channel. “Because such a density of shelling will not allow us to calmly gather people and come for them.” “The enemy has focused efforts on the offensive operation to encircle Lysychansk and Sievierodonetsk. Now, with the support of artillery, they are conducting assault operations in the direction of Toshkivka and Ustynivka, near Lysychansk,” Haidai wrote. Ukraine’s defence ministry reported on Monday that Russian forces were attempting to break through Ukrainian defences around Popasna in an attempt to push west toward Bakhmut, a crucial junction that serves as a command centre for much of the Ukrainian war effort. “I looked up from my prayers and heard a frightening sound,” said 82-year-old Maria Mayashlapak a resident of Bakhmut which has seen repeated airstrikes. “Every day I pray to God asking to avoid injuries. God heard me. God is watching over me.” According to the latest intelligence update by the UK’s Ministry of Defence, capturing Sievierodonetsk would put the whole of Luhannsk region under Russian control, an ambition flagged up by Russia last week. In a further development, the defence correspondent of the Kyiv Independent tweeted late on Tuesday that Ukrainian defenders appeared to have ceded two towns outside the city Horlivka – south of Sievierodonetsk– under “extreme Russian pressure” to retreat to more defensible positions. NEW COPY That appeared to be confirmed by Serhiy Hoshko, the head of the Svitlodarsk military administration who said Russian forces entered the town and hoisted a Russian flag on the city council building. END NEW COPY The Donbas, which includes all of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, is Ukraine’s old industrial heartland running from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border. Predominantly Russian-speaking, almost a third of the area was seized by Russian-backed forces in 2014. During his Monday night address, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, underlined the violence of the fighting around Sievierodonetsk. “The most difficult fighting situation today is in Donbas,” Zelenskiy said, singling out the worst-hit towns of Bakhmut, Popasna and Sievierodonetsk. “The Russian military is trying very hard to show that they allegedly will not give up the captured areas of the Kharkiv region, they will not give up the Kherson region, the occupied territory of the Zaporizhzhya region and Donbas. “In some places they are advancing, where they are pulling up reserves, where they are trying to strengthen their positions. In the coming weeks, the wars will be difficult, and we must be aware of this.” Despite the stepped-up Russian efforts in the Donbas, and huge levels of destruction, some western officials pointed to the difficulties being faced by the Kremlin’s forces amid emerging criticism of the conduct of the campaign by Russian military bloggers. “The Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalised effort in the eastern part of the country,” the Pentagon press secretary, John Kirby, said on Friday, describing the Donbas fighting as very dynamic, with small towns and villages changing hands daily. The lack of resources was underlined last week by an abrupt Russian withdrawal from areas near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city which has been bombarded since the start of the war. Some of those forces apparently were redeployed to the Donbas, but it was not enough to tip the scales on the battlefield. “They really had to thin out the troops they had around Kharkiv, simply because they’re trying to hold to too much of a line with too few troops,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St Andrews in Scotland. Away from Sievierodonetsk, there was also evidence that Russian forces were working to strengthen their tactical position around Kharkiv, having moved some troops from around the city to redeploy units to the fighting further south. The latest fighting came as the bodies of more than 200 people have been discovered in the rubble of a high-rise apartment building in the Ukrainian port city of Mariupol, according to a Ukrainian official. Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol’s mayor, Vadym Boychenko, said workers found the bodies while digging through a basement underneath the collapsed building.

Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has destroyed ‘entire critical infrastructure’ of city Zelenskiy says – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/29/russia-ukraine-war-battle-in-donbas-indescribably-difficult-says-zelenskiy-live,2022-05-30T00:17:42Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. It is just past 3am in Ukraine on the 96th day of Russia’s war. Here is where the crisis currently stands: Officials in eastern Ukraine say Russian shelling of Sievierodonetsk has been so intense that it has not been possible to assess casualties and damage, as Moscow closes in on the largest city still held by Ukraine in the Donbas. Fighting is believed to be taking place in the streets and “the entire critical infrastructure” of the city has been destroyed, according to president Zelenskiy. Ukrainian authorities have described conditions in Sievierodonetsk as reminiscent of Mariupol. The “liberation” of Ukraine’s Donbas region is an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said according to a released from Russia’s foreign ministry. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy visited troops in Kharkiv and toured the country’s second-largest city to see damage by Russian forces in his first official appearance outside the Kyiv area since the start of the war. “Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers… One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation,” he said. According to local officials, over 2,000 apartment blocks have been wholly or partially destroyed by Russian shelling in the region. About 31% of the Kharkiv region’s territory is temporarily occupied by Russian forces while 5% has been liberated by Ukrainian defenders, the head of the Kharkiv regional military administration said. “We are not yet able to fully inspect some of the liberated settlements, conduct full-fledged de-mining and begin rebuilding critical infrastructure, as shelling continues. Where we can do it remotely - we do it,” Oleg Synegubov said according to a release from the president’s office. Zelenskiy said he has fired the head of state security service in Kharkiv for not working to defend the city, adding that “law enforcement officers” are now involved. “I came, figured out and fired the head of the security service of Ukraine of the (Kharkiv) region for the fact that he did not work on the defence of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself,” the president said in his daily national address. “On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out,” he added. The EU failed to agree on an embargo of Russian oil during talks on Sunday while debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions. However, diplomats said they will still try to make progress ahead of a Monday-Tuesday summit on an exemption for pipeline deliveries to landlocked Central European countries. Zelenskiy is set to speak by video link to European Union leaders in Brussels on Monday. The German economy minister, Robert Habeck, raised concerns that European Union unity on new sanctions against Russia is “starting to crumble”. “After Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we saw what can happen when Europe stands united. With a view to the summit tomorrow, let’s hope it continues like this. But it is already starting to crumble,” he told a news conference on Sunday. Russia will continue to supply gas to Serbia, after a phone call between the Russian president and his Serbian counterpart. Aleksandar Vučić said he agreed a three-year gas supply contract with Putin, with further details to be finalised with producer Gazprom. Russia is continuing to ship gas to Europe through Ukraine, Gazprom has confirmed. The Russian gas producer said its supply via the Sudzha entry point stood at 44.1 million cubic metres, up from 43.95 on Saturday. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that president Vladimir Putin is ill. Answering a question from France’s broadcaster TF1, Agence France-Presse quotes Russia’s top diplomat as saying: “I don’t think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.” Zelenskiy said he believed Russia would agree to talks if Ukraine could recapture all the territory it has lost since the invasion. However, he ruled out the idea of using force to win back his land. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Ukraine has started receiving Harpoon anti-ship missiles from Denmark and self-propelled howitzers from the United States. “The coastal defence of our country will not only be strengthened by Harpoon missiles – they will be used by trained Ukrainian teams,” Ukrainian defence minister Oleksiy Reznikov said. Poland has also agreed to send artillery to Ukraine, Polish state media reported. Nato is no longer bound by past commitments to hold back from deploying its forces in eastern Europe, the US-led alliance’s deputy secretary general has said. Moscow itself has “voided of any content” the Nato-Russia Founding Act, by attacking Ukraine and halting dialogue with the alliance, Mircea Geoana told Agence France-Presse. Under the 1997 Founding Act, intended to reset the relationship between Russia and the Alliance, both sides agreed to work to “prevent any potentially threatening build-up of conventional forces in agreed regions of Europe, to include Central and Eastern Europe”. Geoana, speaking in the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius, said: They took decisions, they made obligations there not to aggress neighbours, which they are doing, and to have regular consultations with Nato, which they don’t. So I think that in fact this founding act is basically not functioning because of Russia,” he added. Russia, he said, had effectively moved away from the terms of the 1997 agreement. Now we have no restrictions to have robust posture in the eastern flank and to ensure that every square inch of Nato’s territory is protected by Article 5 and our allies.” Nato’s article 5 is the one referring to collective defence, which says that an attack on one member is an attack on all of them. Geoana did not give details of any such planned deployment, but said he anticipated “a robust, flexible and sustainable presence”. Capturing Sievierodonetsk is a “fundamental task” for Russia as 90% of houses in the city are now damaged, Zelenskiy has said. As a result of the Russian strikes at Sievierodonetsk, the entire critical infrastructure of the city has already been destroyed. 90% of houses are damaged. More than two-thirds of the city’s housing stock has been completely destroyed. There is no mobile connection. Constant shelling. Capturing Sievierodonetsk is a fundamental task for the occupying contingent. And they don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this attempt to raise the Russian flag on 32 Druzhby Narodiv boulevard (Friendship of Nations - ed.) - no matter how bitter the name sounds now - where the Sievierodonetsk administration is located. We are doing everything to repel this offensive.” Here is a little more on the situation unfolding in Ukraine’s north-eastern city of Kharkiv. President Zelenskiy noted in his most recent national address: Kharkiv suffered terrible blows from the occupiers. Black, burnt-out, half-ruined apartment buildings face east and north with their windows - from where Russian artillery was firing. From where Russian combat aircraft arrived... Russia has already lost not only the battle for Kharkiv, not only the battle for Kyiv and the north of our country. It lost its own future and any cultural ties to the free world. They all burned down. In particular, there, in Saltivka. One third of the Kharkiv region is still under occupation. We will definitely liberate the entire territory. And everyone should work for this result in positions both at the local level and at the state level.” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov has denied speculation that president Vladimir Putin is ill. Answering a question from France’s broadcaster TF1, Agence France-Presse quotes Russia’s top diplomat as saying: “I don’t think that sane people can see in this person signs of some kind of illness or ailment.” Lavrov said that Putin, who will turn 70 in October, appeared in public “every day. “You can watch him on screens, read and listen to his speeches,” Lavrov said in comments released by the Russian foreign ministry. “I leave it to the conscience of those who spread such rumours.” Putin’s health and private life are taboo subjects in Russia, and are almost never discussed in public. Volodymyr Zelenskiy, fresh off his first trip to Kharkiv since the invasion, said on Telegram today that he has fired the head of state security service in the Kharkiv region for not working to defend the city and instead thinking “only about himself”. He said law enforcement officers were investigating why the former head of state security was thinking “only about himself”. Zelenskiy also said Sunday that all critical infrastructure in Sievierodonetsk, the largest city still under Ukrainian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been destroyed. Meanwhile, Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, went on the French TV channel TF1 to say that the “liberation” of the Donbas is an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. Serhiy Haidai, regional governor of the Luhansk oblast, said Sunday that the situation in Lysychansk, a city of 103,000 in the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine, has become “significantly worse”. Russian troops heavily shelled the Sumy oblast near Kharkiv today. Now, it looks like the shelling has continued: Scenes from Mariupol: In a surreal bid to return to normalcy, the residents of Kyiv rang in Kyiv Day today with children climbing over burned Russian tanks and amid displays of Russian weapon systems that just weeks ago were used to attack this very city. Russian forces focused heavily on capturing the capital of Kyiv early on in the invasion, laying waste to many of the surrounding cities and towns in the Kyiv oblast as Ukrainian forces held strong. In early April, Ukrainian forces were able to push them back, retaking occupied territories throughout the region and uncovering mass graves and horrific evidence that Russian troops had engaged in widespread torture and killing of civilians. In the months since, residents have worked to get back to some form of normalcy, returning to restaurants and shops as they reopen in Kyiv even as they watched for news of missile strikes on their compatriots elsewhere in the country. Sergei Lavrov, the foreign minister of Russia, went on the French TV channel TF1 to say that the “liberation” of the Donbas is an “unconditional priority” for Moscow, while other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own, Reuters is reporting. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognized by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Lavrov said in an interview. For the other territories in Ukraine, “the people should decide their future in these areas,” Lavrov said. In Kherson, a city in the south of Ukraine, nine out of 10 pharmacies are not operational, leaving its residents in a terrible situation where they cannot access the medications they need to live their lives. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Telegram today that he has fired the head of state security service in Kharkiv for not working to defend the city. AFP is reporting that Zelenskiy said in his daily national address that “law enforcement officers” are involved in his reason for dismissing the head of security service. “I came, figured out and fired the head of the security service of Ukraine of the (Kharkiv) region for the fact that he did not work on the defense of the city from the first days of the full-scale war, but thought only about himself,” Zelensky said in his daily national address. “On which motives? The law enforcement officers will figure it out,” he added. Today Zelenskiy visited Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. Though much of the Kremlin’s focus has turned to the southeast region of the country, Russian forces are still shelling Kharkiv regularly. Zelenskiy’s office said 2,229 buildings have been destroyed in Kharkiv and the region. “We will restore, rebuild and bring back life. In Kharkiv and all other towns and villages where evil came,” it said on his Telegram account. Zelenskiy spent his trip meeting with local officials - the governor of Kharkiv region and the mayor of the city - to discuss reconstruction programmes for the region, calling on them to “find cool projects” to rebuild destroyed areas. “This is a chance for such districts to have a new face,” Zelenskiy said. “In this war, the occupiers are trying to squeeze out at least some result,” Zelenskiy said in a later post. “But they should have understood long ago that we will defend our land to the last man. They have no chance. We will fight and we will definitely win.” Bakhmut, a city of 72,000 in the Donetsk region in the Donbas, was heavily hit this weekend - and its residents are preparing for even more heavy shelling from Russian forces in the days to come. Here’s a look at the situation in the Donbas at the moment: In the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine, Ukrainian servicemen and women readied themselves for the worst. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that Ukraine could lose 50 to 100 soldiers a day defending the eastern region of the country. Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Sunday that all critical infrastructure in Sievierodonetsk, the largest city still under Ukrainian control in the eastern Donbas region, has been destroyed, Reuters is reporting. The Ukrainian president confirmed that taking Sievierodonetsk is Russia’s principal aim. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War had previously noted that the Kremlin’s fixation on Sievierodonetsk had drawn resources from other battlefronts, resulting in little progress elsewhere. The situation in Lysychansk, a city of 103,000 in the Luhansk oblast in eastern Ukraine, has become “significantly worse”, Serhiy Haidai, regional governor of the Luhansk oblast, said Sunday. “A Russian shell fell on a residential building, a girl died and four people were hospitalized,” he said on Telegram. According to AFP, Haidai said that fighting in the city of Severodonetsk was advancing street by street. An estimated 15,000 civilians remained in Severodonetsk, but a local official said the “constant shelling” was making it increasingly difficult to get in or out. “Evacuation is very unsafe, it’s isolated cases when we manage to get people out. Now the priority is for the wounded and people who need serious medical assistance,” Oleksandr Stryuk, head of the city’s military and civil administration, told AFP. Residents have also gone more than two weeks without a mobile phone connection, Stryuk said, and the water supply was becoming increasingly unstable. Russian troops heavily shelled the Sumy oblast and Chernihiv oblast today: The German economy minister, Robert Habeck, has raised concerns that European Union unity on new sanctions against Russia is “starting to crumble”, reports Reuters. It comes ahead of a summit this week to discuss a further package of sanctions against Moscow, including an unprecedented halt to Russian oil imports. “After Russia’s attack on Ukraine, we saw what can happen when Europe stands united. With a view to the summit tomorrow, let’s hope it continues like this. But it is already starting to crumble,” he told a news conference earlier today. The latest proposed sanctions have been blocked by landlocked Hungary. The country has no access to oil cargo ships, while 65% of its oil needs are supplied by Russia via the Druzhba pipeline. Having rejected a proposal to allow it two years longer than the other 26 states to wean itself off Russian oil, Budapest wants at least four years and EU funds to adapt its refineries to process non-Russian crude and boost pipeline capacity to Croatia. A compromise tabled by France would exclude the Druzhba pipeline from a future oil embargo and only impose sanctions on oil shipped to the EU by tanker vessel. Habeck called for Germany to speak with one voice at the summit instead of abstaining from votes due to differences of opinion within the country’s ruling coalition. He called for similar unity from other EU states. “Europe is still a huge economic area with incredible economic power. And when it stands united, it can use that power,” he said. You can read more about the debate over whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports here: Allowing Russia to win would “push humanity back into the dark ages”, Mykhaylo Podolyak, a Ukrainian presidential adviser, has said. “‘Why does the world pay more attention to Ukraine than to Africa or the east?’ – such a narrative is promoted by [Russian] influence agents,” he tweeted. “The war in [Ukraine] is not a local conflict – it is the question of what the world will be like tomorrow.” Arguing that if Russia were to win the war, “any autocrat” would be able to provoke territorial conflicts and seize countries, he added that stopping Russia was the mission of all civilised countries. “Allowing [Russia] to win is to open Pandora’s box &amp; push humanity back into the dark ages,” said Podolyak. Here’s a roundup of today’s news, as Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has visited troops outside Kyiv for the first time since Russia’s invasion, and Vladimir Putin’s forces continue their assault on the Donbas region. Ukrainian forces are resisting Russian attacks in Sievierodonetsk in Donbas, where fighting is taking place in the streets. Shelling is so intense in Luhansk that its governor, Serhiy Haidai, said it was impossible to determine casualties. Ukraine’s President Zelenskiy has visited troops in Kharkiv and toured the city to see damage by Russian forces for himself. Mariupol city council deputy Oleksandr Lashin said that the now-occupied city had no water, electricity and was “unsanitary”. Russia has given up on capturing Kyiv but the country’s ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, insists it was never a target. In a broadcast interview with the BBC’s Clive Myrie, Kelin said that claims of war crimes in Bucha, near Kyiv, were a “fabrication”. He also disputed footage of civilians being shot. Ukrainian politician Kira Rudik said she would ask UK MPs for more long-range missiles, help getting exports moving out of the country and for visa requirements in the UK to be relaxed. The EU is debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions. Poland has agreed to send artillery to Ukraine, Polish state media has reported. Russia will continue to supply gas to Serbia, after a phone call between the Russian president and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vučić. More on president Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s visit to Kharkiv. Zelenskiy’s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, wrote on the Telegram app that the president had also visited Ukraine’s second-largest city of Kharkiv. Yermak said Zelenskiy toured destroyed residential buildings, noting that their replacements had to be built with bomb shelters in place. The president’s chief of staff added that 31% of Kharkiv region’s territory was currently occupied by Russia, and a further 5% had been taken back by Ukraine having been occupied earlier. Ukrainian TV station Espreso has reported comments by Mariupol city council deputy Oleksandr Lashin about the current state of the now-Russian occupied city in south-eastern Ukraine. He said the city was unsanitary and lacked water and electricity. “There is a collapse in Mariupol. There is light in some places and the occupiers tried to give water, but the streets are flooded, streams run down the roads, the sewage stinks everywhere. There are also corpse odours. There is a lot of unsanitary conditions in the city,” he said. “The Russian occupiers cannot bring order to their country. Especially in Ukraine, it does not work out, people are not capable of anything and they will not be able to establish communication. Poor people who cannot leave, they are simply captives of the occupiers.” The EU is debating whether to water down a ban on Russian oil imports to placate Hungary’s leader, Viktor Orbán, who is blocking the latest European sanctions against Vladimir Putin’s war machine. Under a compromise, the EU could ban Russian oil arriving on tankers but allow pipeline imports, a proposal that would allow Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic to continue being supplied via the Soviet-era Druzhba pipeline that runs through Ukraine. More than three weeks after the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, proposed a complete ban on Russian oil imports to the EU by the end of the year, the bloc is stalled on the plans. Hungary, which is heavily dependent on Russian oil, has said it needs five years and billions of euros to upgrade its refineries. Read more: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has visited troops in Kharkiv, the first time he has made an official appearance outside Kyiv since the Russian invasion in February. “You risk your lives for us all and for our country,” the president’s office website cited him as saying to the soldiers, adding that he handed out commendations and gifts. A crowdfunder set up to raise cash Tymofiy Seidov, eight, who was the only child left in his bombed out village near the city of Kharkiv, in north east Ukraine until his evacuation last Sunday has surpassed its £10,000 target after two anonymous donors pledged £3,000 and £2,000 respectively for travel and accommodation for Tymofiy and his family. The Guardian’s Brussels bureau chief wrote about how Tymofiy spent much of his time drawing monsters and tanks and remembered sunny days while sheltering for three months in a dark basement below the ruins of a kindergarten with 23 others including his mum, aunt and grandmother. A volunteer offered to resettle Tymofiy and his family but they needed funds for travel and accommodation on the way. Poland has agreed to send artillery to Ukraine, Polish state media has reported. A plan for Poland to transfer 28 MiG-29 jets familiar to Ukrainian pilots in March via the US collapsed after White House objection. Last month, the UK said it was looking at sending British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland so that Warsaw could in turn send Ukraine more T-72 tanks, the Russian design used by its armed forces. The head of the Russian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Kirill, said he understood the decision of Ukraine’s branch of the church to cut ties with Moscow. “We fully understand how the Ukrainian Orthodox Church is suffering today,” the head of the Russian Orthodox Church said in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in central Moscow. “We understand that His Beatitude Metropolitan Onufriy and the episcopate should act as wisely as possible today so as not to complicate the lives of their believers,” Patriarch Kirill said in his first comments since the announcement, according to Agence-France Presse. He added that the “spirits of malice” wanted to divide the Orthodox people of Russia and Ukraine but they would not succeed. On Friday, the Ukrainian Orthodox Church that had been aligned with Moscow announced it was cutting ties with Russia over its offensive in Ukraine, declaring “full independence” in a historic move against Russia’s spiritual authorities. The pro-Moscow branch of Ukraine’s Orthodox Church had earlier pledged allegiance to Russia’s Patriarch Kirill, who has fully backed president Vladimir Putin’s invasion. Russia will continue to supply gas to Serbia, after a phone call between the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vučić. The Kremlin said the leaders discussed the issues of Ukraine, and Kosovo, and that the two countries will form a closer partnership, according to Reuters. Vučić said he agreed a three-year gas supply contract with Putin, with further details to be finalised with producer Gazprom. In the phone call, he also discussed expanding his country’s gas storage network. Vladimir Kara-Murza’s wife, Evgenia, thinks he will have been like a “hurricane contained inside a bottle” since he was arrested on 11 April in Moscow and held in pre-trial detention over a speech he made in Arizona criticising the war in Ukraine. “He has so much energy, so many ideas, and initiatives, that being contained within the four walls of a prison will be the hardest part for him,” said Evgenia, who has not been allowed to speak to him. As a Russian politician, campaigner and regime critic, Vladimir Kara-Murza worked for 15 years alongside Boris Nemtsov, another opposition leader, who was killed in 2015. A dispatch here from Reuters reporters in Ukraine, as Russia continues its assaults to try to capture the Donbas region. Ukrainian forces were on Sunday resisting a Russian assault on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city they still hold in the eastern Donbas region, but were weathering heavy artillery barrages, Ukrainian officials said. The shelling was so intense it was not possible to assess casualties and damage, the governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said. Dozens of buildings have been destroyed in the past few days. “The situation has extremely escalated,” Haidai said. The Ukrainian government meanwhile urged the west to provide it with more longer-range weapons in order to turn the tide in the war, now in its fourth month. The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern side of the Siverskyi Donets River, has become the focus of attention as Russia ekes out slow but solid gains in the Donbas, comprising of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions. Russia’s fixation on Sievierodonetsk had drawn resources from other battlefronts and as result they had made little progress elsewhere, according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the military situation in the Donbas – parts of which are controlled by Moscow-backed separatists – was very complicated but defences were holding up in a number of places, including Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. “It’s indescribably difficult there. And I am grateful to all those who withstood this onslaught,” he said in his nightly video address. More than 500 Ukrainian children who fled the war without their parents are stuck waiting in limbo across Europe after applying to the Homes for Ukraine scheme, sources working closely with the Home Office say. Most are teenagers who thought they would be eligible and have British families waiting to host them, but have heard nothing from the Home Office. Many have been waiting for two months or more without an answer due to indecision about how to handle their cases. Best-selling Ukrainian author Andrey Kurkov has written for the Sunday Times in the UK today, talking about the uncertainty that many in the country are facing. Kurkov, who wrote the acclaimed Death and the Penguin, penned his piece as there was a call at Davos this week by former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger for Ukraine to give up some territory in exchange for peace. Some interesting extracts here I understand that those on whom the outcome of the war hinges may not be as interested in Ukraine’s victory as I am. They may not see a way to return occupied territories to Ukraine and protect our independence while also ensuring their own safety and prosperity. Kurkov wrote that there were delays in supplying old fighter planes to help Ukraine’s air force, and the Swiss and Israeli governments have blocked sales of shells and missiles. I tried hard to find a person in Ukraine who would approve of a deal with Putin for the sake of an end to the war. But I failed. Nina Yanchuk, a retired lady who lives with her husband, Tolik, next door to our summer house in the rural Zhytomyr region, was typically defiant when I asked her if it wouldn’t be better to come to some agreement with Putin. “No, there can be no negotiations with Putin — only war to the bitter end. How can you talk about anything with him after such atrocities? What’s more, he’s a cheat. How many times has he deceived everyone?” Away from the morning TV broadcast round in the UK, Reuters is reporting that the Russian defence ministry said it has destroyed a large Ukrainian army arsenal in Kryvyi Rih. The defence ministry said Russian anti-aircraft defence systems shot down a SU-25 jet in Dnipro, according to Russian news agency Tass. Myrie asks if Kelin believes Russia could use nuclear weapons against the UK, as indicated by Russia Channel One journalist Dmitry Kiselyov, or against Ukraine in the conflict. Kelin says: “No, no, I don’t believe that. He is a journalist, he is like you, he is trying to find something juicy to put on the television and make it loud, a loud statement, he has done it, like you, trying to instigate me. He has instigated a discussion. “Tactical nuclear weapon according to Russian military doctrine is not used in conflicts like this at all. I do not think so. We have strict provisions on use of tactical nuclear weapons. It has nothing to do with the current operation.” And that’s it. Myrie asks Kelin if he’s scared to speak out like Bondarev did against the war this week. He said he doesn’t agree with Bondarev in any way at all. Kelin becomes increasingly tetchy. “I have been shown, what you would like to ask me, it was totally different issues. If you are only interested to provoke me ... then it will be our last ... we can finish on this point.” Myrie repeats foreign secretary Liz Truss’s words that the conflict can’t end until Russian forces leave. Kelin calls Truss “belligerent”, saying she will prolong the war. “It will be no good for Ukraine, it will be no good for European peace and stability.” Kelin says that 75% of people in Russia support the invasion and that Russia’s representative at the UN, Boris Bondarev, who spoke out against the war this week was not respected by Russia. Bondarev said the invasion had involved “warmongering, lies and hatred”. “He is very unprofessional ... he does not have our respect,” Kelin says. Kelin then tries to deny that the devastation in Mariupol is the fault of Russian forces, indicating that the Ukrainian army could be to blame. Myrie then turns the question around and says that it is possible in Kelin’s eyes that Russia is responsible. “Russians are targeting military infrastructure, collateral damage is possible,” Kelin says. On to Bucha, the town near Kyiv, where there was evidence Russian forces committed war crimes against civilians. Clive Myrie shows aerial footage roughly two weeks apart showing dead bodies on Bucha’s streets. “Is this how Russian troops are supposed to conduct this war. It suggests they are committing war crimes,” Myrie says. Andrei Kelin says that for three days after Russian troops left there was no evidence of any dead bodies. “Can you imagine any professional troops, they will step over dead bodies and just leave them? I cannot believe this, it is unprofessional. “In our view, it is a fabrication. It is used to interrupt negotiations. There were, at the beginning of the conflict, we had very good negotiations. The Ukrainians have had a constructive position, and then it changed, someone has used this situation to cut off that negotiation, and there is now a stalemate.” Myrie shows Kelin CCTV footage showing two Russian soldiers at a building in Ukraine shooting at two civilians walking away from them. Kelin says he would like to show Russian videos of Ukraine shelling Russian civilians. He then denies that they are Russian soldiers, saying it could be a “piece of a film, or a piece of a game”. The Russian ambassador asks if they are having an interview or if Myrie is just expressing his point of view, as he becomes increasingly unhappy. Kelin says that Russia has given up on Kyiv in response to Myrie’s question, “yes, I think,”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
he says. He adds that none of Russia’s leaders, including Vladimir Putin, have ever said they wanted to seize Kyiv. “I don’t believe it is possible to seize Kyiv or occupy Kyiv, it is a big big city.” Myrie asks why troops were in the region near the capital if they never had any intention of occupying or taking it, saying he saw them himself. “We did have troops, but not for the seizure of Kyiv. I’m not a military person, I am not a diplomat, but even I understand that if you want to do things on one front, you have to do different things on another. “We didn’t have a goal of seizing Kyiv at the initial stage. I don’t believe that’s a possibility.” Myrie says there is no evidence of Ukraine looking to start a war or operation against Russia, so asks again why Russia took this action of invading, saying it is not a “limited operation”. More civilians have been killed in the conflict since February than in the last eight years, Myrie says, so he repeats his question asking where the threat to Russia was. Kelin disputes this. He says that they are not targeting civilians, only “military infrastructure”. “We would like to diminish Ukrainian capabilities of striking, first of all and we need to help these now independent republics to survive.” Now Myrie is interviewing Andrey Kelin, Russia’s ambassador to the UK. Myrie starts by reading out the death toll and the number of people displaced in the war to Kelin, asking why Russia started the war. Kelin denies it’s a war, repeating the Russian line that it’s a “limited operation”. He says he knows it is unpopular in Britain, but says it is because the media is only presenting one side of the story. “Right now, events are going on in the east, south-east of Ukraine. During 8 years of nationalistic government have come to power in Kyiv, they have built a fortress, which is where the majority of Ukrainian forces are concentrated. This is a highly fortified area, from which we are certain events could be started, whether it will be used by Ukrainian army as defensive, or we have evidence that they are planning an offensive against Donbas region, against Russians living over there. “As President Putin said, we have had no other way to do this.” Across to BBC One, where Clive Myrie is presenting today’s episode of Sunday Morning. He hears from veteran war reporter Jeremy Bowen that the Russians are making small gains, using heavy artillery to bombard Ukrainians, who don’t have equal or superior firepower themselves. Speaking from the Donbas, Bowen says that there is “very very strong” evidence of war crimes committed by Russians. In a moving section, Rudik starts to cry as she tells Ridge stories of how children have been affected by the conflict. She recalls how one mother was teaching her toddler his blood type in a bomb shelter in case he was injured. In another, a girl asked her mother if they were now refugees, and in Mariupol were being evacuated without their parents. “They were saying [to their children] whatever happened, hold onto your backpacks, hold onto your backpacks. At these refugee centres you are hugging this child, and telling them ‘give it to me and find out what’s in there’. They are saying no, and asking if they will see their mummy again. “When you open up they have written down small things saying ‘Mummy loves you’, their paperwork, and ‘please, please make him safe.’ “This is what I want for Ukrainian children, to make them safe.” In meetings this week, Rudyk says she’s asking the UK defence select committee in the UK for long-range missiles to help stop the Russian advance in the east, for visa papers for Ukrainians, the 36-year-old saying it is making it more difficult for refugees to reach the UK. Ukrainians are having to travel through Europe without visas, she says, and that the process has been eased up for the US and Canada, but not the UK. Rudyk said it would only affect 20,000 people. Rudyk adds that exports including sunflower oil, grain, tomatoes and corn are being held up in Ukraine. “Right now it is all blocked in Ukraine and we cannot deliver it anywhere because of the blocked ports. “We need a humanitarian mission to extract this produce. I know you guys are having higher food prices, sunflower oil is missing from the stores, you know why, because it is all in Ukraine right now. The world only has 10 weeks supplies of grains, 10 weeks for all the politicians and leaders of the world to figure how they will get it out of Ukraine,” she said. Ridge asks Rudyk whether she feels safe. She says she does in the UK, where she is currently visiting and meeting with politicians. Rudyk talks about hearing air raid sirens and attacks on cities in Ukraine. “The threat and the fear is still there ... I will go back home, because this is the fight we have to put up and we have to win. I dream of the day that all Ukrainians will feel safe. They will be able to sit with their hands on their lap and think ‘we are okay now.’ “The important thing is that children feel safe. The protests at Downing Street, at the rallies, people were saying that they felt so uncomfortable that they had to leave. They feel great that people are supporting us, but they feel guilty. I said: ‘Don’t, you make sure that your children are not going through this terror and going through this drama. You have to make sure they are safe’. “That’s why I’m telling Ukrainian people wherever you are, we’re all together, we are supporting our country and every single person is doing it their own way.” Ukrainian MP Kira Rudyk is now speaking to Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday. She is a member of the territorial armed forces in Ukraine, and part of a group that would help defend Kyiv. She talked through the feeling of being unsafe and what it is now like in the country. “My life as a politician, as a member of the resistance, it’s different from anything I could have ever imagined. I stay at home, I still have resistance members staying with me, they are training and I am training with them. We are training to shoot and how to protect part of the territory. “We are part of the major resistance of the Kyiv region. And some of the people have gone to war, and some of the members of my team have gone also. “We still have one month’s supply of food and water at home, because it’s so scary that there will be no water, I was thinking ‘I don’t want to die dirty’ so I have loads of water everywhere.” Russia is continuing to ship gas to Europe through Ukraine, Gazprom has confirmed. The Russian gas producer said its supply via the Sudzha entry point stood at 44.1 million cubic metres, up from 43.95 on Saturday. The amount is still lower than that seen earlier in May, which stood at 95.8mcm before Ukraine stopped a route through Kyiv because of the war. An application to supply gas via another entry point, Sokhranovka, was rejected by Ukraine, according to Reuters. This is Harry Taylor in London, bringing you more updates throughout today. Their reports in the Observer revealed the reality of life in the occupied city. Now two female Ukrainian journalists are safe in England but want to continue their work. Here is an extract of a feature on the duo, by Miranda Bryant. In a series of dispatches for the Observer at the start of the war, the two female Ukrainian journalists bravely documented the horrors of life in occupied Kherson – from the city’s brave resistance to looming humanitarian disaster and burying the dead. But they also offered an insight into how, despite it all, residents fiercely continued to find glimmers of joy: a tale of young hospital interns getting married; drinking coffee at their favourite coffee shop under the roar of artillery strikes. There were scenes of dark humour too. In one dispatch, they described how a queue of civilians laughed a group of empty-handed Russian soldiers out of the butcher’s shop because they were unimpressed with the quality of meat available. Despite growing numbers of people leaving, the escalating danger – particularly for journalists – and dwindling supplies, the old friends, who are both in their 50s, hadn’t planned to leave their home city. Despite writing anonymously, they feared being identified by their reporting. One of their friends, Oleh Baturin, was detained and tortured for eight days and threatened with mutilation and death, and Maxim Negrov, the owner of the online newspaper Postfactum, was arrested and detained. They also worried that if the city were liberated it could lead to further killings by Russian soldiers. But it was only when they were offered seats in friends’ cars that they made the decision to go. Borisova in a car with her daughter-in-law and a baby, and Poliakova with a friend and her cat. Their husbands and sons remain in Kherson. “I made up my mind very quickly, during half a day,” said Borisova. “Not because of me, more for the sake of my daughter-in-law because my son begged me. Now with all these Bucha stories [of rape], he was very afraid. He said: ‘I will sleep well when you girls get out of Kherson.’” She added: “That chance was given to me and it was too foolish not to take it.” They left just in time. Read more here: Russia has demonstrated is it prepared to leverage global food security for its own political aim and then present itself as the reasonable actor and blame the west for any failure, the latest UK Ministry of Defence intelligence update has said. On 25 May, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food through the Black Sea in return for the lifting of sanctions. The minister also requested Ukraine de-mine the area around the port of Odesa to allow the passage of ships. In this instance, Ukraine has only deployed maritime mines because of the continued credible threat of Russian amphibious assaults from the Black Sea. Russia has demonstrated it is prepared to leverage global food security for its own political aim and then present itself as the reasonable actor and blame the west for any failure. Russia’s attempt to achieve a reduction in the severity of international sanctions also highlights the stresses sanctions are placing on the regime. A dispatch here from the Associated Press in Pokrovsk, to where some civilians were able to flee as Russian forces pressed their offensive to take the eastern Ukrainian cities of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, the last major cities under Ukrainian control in the Luhansk region. Bouncing her 18-month-old son on her lap, Yana Skakova choked back tears as she described living in a basement under relentless bombing, and having to leave her husband behind when she fled with her baby and four-year-old son. Initially after the war broke out, there were quiet times when they could come out of the basement to cook in the street and let the children play outdoors. But about a week ago, the bombing intensified. For the past five days, they hadn’t been able to venture out of the basement at all. “Now the situation is bad, it’s scary to go out,” she said. It was the police who came to evacuate them on Friday from the basement where 18 people, including nine children, had been living for the past two and a half months. “We were sitting there, then the traffic police came and they said: you should evacuate as fast as possible, since it is dangerous to stay in Lysychansk now,’” Skakova said. Despite the bombings and the lack of electricity, gas and water, nobody really wanted to go. “None of us wanted to leave our native city,” she said. “But for the sake of these small children, we decided to leave.” She broke down in tears as she described how her husband stayed behind to take care of their house and animals. “Yehor is 1 1/2-years old, and now he’s without a father,” Skakova said. More than 682 children have been injured or killed in Ukraine, according to a government statement. It said 242 had died and 440 wounded, adding that the figures were not final as it was difficult to confirm reports in places of active fighting. The largest numbers were in Donetsk (153), Kyiv (116) and Kharkiv (108). Ukraine’s armed forces have accused Russian authorities in Crimea of ordering hospitals to refuse civilian patients in order to free up beds for Russian soldiers. In a statement on its Facebook page, the forces said donor blood was also being collected “intensively”. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has ruled out the idea of using force to win back all the land Ukraine has lost to Russia since 2014, which includes the southern peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow that year. “I do not believe that we can restore all of our territory by military means. If we decide to go that way, we will lose hundreds of thousands of people,” he said. Fighting for the eastern Ukrainian city of Sievierodonetsk continues with Russian forces conducting assault operations on Saturday, the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces said on Sunday. “With the use of artillery, Russian forces carried out assault operations in the area of the city of Sievierodonetsk,” the general staff said in a statement on its Facebook page. “The fighting continues. “There remains a threat of the task from the territory of the Republic of Belarus of rocket and aviation strikes on Ukrainian infrastructural objects.” Hello and welcome to today’s continuing coverage of the Ukraine war. Below is a quick summary of the latest developments. Ukraine is in a race against time to save the eastern Donbas region as relentless Russian artillery and air strikes threaten to turn the tide of the war, and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping. You can read our latest wrap here: Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a Saturday night television address that conditions in Donbas were “indescribably difficult”, and thanked Ukrainian defenders holding out in the face of the onslaught. Ukraine is urgently pleading for heavy weapons to repel Russian forces in the eastern Donbas region, as relentless Russian artillery and airstrikes threaten to turn the tide of the war and support for Kyiv’s continued defiance among some west European allies appears to be slipping. Zelenskiy has conceded that not all the land that Russia has seized since it annexed Crimea in 2014 can be recaptured militarily. While he is certain his country will take back the territory Russia has claimed since its 24 February invasion, he said other territory could not be recovered by force. Russia’s defence ministry claims to have captured the strategically important city of Lyman and several other smaller towns and encircled Sievierodonetsk, which Ukraine denies. At least six superyachts linked to UK-sanctioned Russian oligarchs have “gone dark” on ocean tracking systems, vanishing from the global maps used to locate marine traffic. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, has scrapped the upper age limit for military recruits in the face of mounting losses in Ukraine, Tass reported. UK intelligence estimated this month Russia had lost about a third of its ground forces. Officials in the south-eastern port city of Mykolaiv said at least one person was killed, and at least six injured, in Russian shelling. Two rounds landed in courtyards of high-rise buildings, and one shell fell close to a kindergarten, CNN reported. Boris Johnson and Zelenskiy discussed concerns over food supplies in a phone call. A Downing Street spokesperson said Johnson told Zelenskiy the UK would continue to support Ukraine’s armed resistance, including by supplying equipment. Putin spoke to French president Emmanuel Macron and German chancellor Olaf Scholz and, according to the Kremlin, he told them that continuing arms supplies was “dangerous”, warning “of the risks of further destabilisation of the situation and aggravation of the humanitarian crisis”. Russia said it was willing to discuss ways to make it possible for Ukraine to resume shipments of grain from Black Sea ports. Spain is sending a battery of surface-to-air missiles and about 100 troops to the Nato forward presence mission in Latvia, joining about 500 compatriots already present in the Baltic state," El País reported.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukrainian MP urges west to supply long-range rockets or risk Russian victory,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/ukrainian-mp-urges-west-supply-long-range-rockets-risk-russian-victory-kira-rudik,2022-05-30T04:00:19Z,Kira Rudik says on visit to UK that without further military help Ukraine will fail to push back invaders,"A Ukrainian MP visiting Britain has urged the west to supply long-range rockets to her country – and warned without further military help her country risked deadlock or defeat in its war against Russia. Kira Rudik, the leader of the opposition liberal Golos party, said she was afraid of the three-month long war “becoming the new normal” and that the west would not supply the Nato-standard weapons Ukraine needed to push back the invaders. “One bad outcome is that this war becomes a stalemate, like a long-term frozen conflict,” Rudik said in an interview with the Guardian. “One of our goals is to make sure that the world does not get used to a war being in Ukraine.” The MP argued that Ukraine’s “first and foremost need is weapons” because without battlefield success Kyiv would come under pressure to give up territory to Russia, as suggested by the veteran US diplomat Henry Kissinger – a suggestion Rudik said was “borderline … how do I not say the word stupid?”. The 36-year-old said she was in daily contact with frontline troops and conceded Ukraine’s military was “not fine; they are under a lot of pressure” as Russian forces advance under heavy shelling in the eastern Donbas region. “We should not repeat Russia’s mistake of underestimating us. We should not underestimate Russia right now,” Rudik said. It remained possible that as well a deadlock, Ukraine could yet be more seriously defeated, she added. Ukraine’s army needed multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) with a range of hundreds of kilometres, Rudik argued, which are already the subject of intense lobbying by Kyiv – and which could be supplied by the US and others within days. “We need to let our soldiers on the front fight better and for that we need MLRS systems, longer-range systems,” Rudik said. “We know that there is like no peaceful agreement on this conflict. We will need to win it militarily.” Capable of firing 12 rockets in a minute, Ukraine believes the US-made M270 MLRS could turn around Kyiv’s fortunes, with Russia currently outshelling it and, under the heavy bombardment, closing in on Sievierodonetsk. But the rocket artillery is controversial not least because it would give Ukraine the capacity to reach inside Russia. That has prompted warnings from Moscow that a US decision to supply the systems would “cross a red line”. Rudik is in the UK for a few days where she is meeting MPs in London and Scotland, including Tobias Ellwood, the chair of the defence select committee, part of her first trip abroad since the war began on 24 February. On the second day of the war Rudik was pictured holding a Kalashnikov rifle, saying she was prepared to use it to defend Kyiv. “Our women will protect our soil the same way as our men,” she wrote in a tweet that was picked up around the world. The MP said she did not have to use the weapon as Russian forces bore down on Kyiv in the first weeks of the war, but insisted she remained willing to do so if necessary, not least because of the sexual violence the invaders had inflicted on Ukrainian women and girls in occupied suburbs north-east of the capital. “I have been to Bucha, Irpin and Borodianka since the days of the occupation and I have talked to women who suffered from sexual crimes,” she said. “Honestly, this is probably one of the parts [reasons] why I have the rifle.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Turkey blocks early vote on Sweden and Finland joining Nato,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/18/sweden-and-finland-formally-apply-to-join-nato,2022-05-18T16:26:38Z,Move comes hours after the Nordic nations officially launched their bids to join the alliance,"Sweden and Finland have formally submitted their applications to join Nato but Turkey blocked an early move to fast-track the Nordic countries’ requests, demanding they extradite “terrorists” and that the alliance respect its concerns. The Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, accepted the two historically non-aligned Nordic countries’ membership requests, each in a white folder embossed with their national flag, at the US-led defensive alliance’s HQ in Brussels on Wednesday. “I warmly welcome the requests by Finland and Sweden to join Nato. You are our closest partners,” Stoltenberg told the two countries’ ambassadors, hailing the occasion as “a historic step” and “a good day at a critical time for our safety”. However, multiple reports cited diplomatic sources as saying Turkey later blocked a vote by Nato ambassadors on opening talks immediately, suggesting the first stage of the accession process may take longer than the two weeks the alliance planned. The enlargement of Nato must be approved by all 30 members and then ratified by their parliaments, which could take up to a year. The alliance has said it wants to move as fast as possible given the potential Russian threat to Finland and Sweden. The two countries’ applications represent a radical redrawing of Europe’s security landscape in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and, if successful, would represent the most significant expansion of Nato in decades, doubling the alliance’s border with Russia. Stoltenberg said Nato would “take into account the security interests” of all members and was “determined to work through the issues and reach rapid conclusions”. All allies agreed on the importance of enlargement, he said, adding: “We all agree we must stand together and that this is an historic moment we must seize.” In Ankara, however, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan told MPs from his AK party the alliance must respect Turkey’s reservations. “Nato expansion is only meaningful for us in proportion to the respect that will be shown to our sensitivities,” he said. Turkey accuses Sweden and Finland of harbouring members of Kurdish militant groups it considers terrorist organisations, and also objects to their decisions in 2019 to ban arms exports to Ankara over Turkey’s military operations in Syria. Erdoğan accused Stockholm in particular of providing safe haven to members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers’ party (PKK) and to followers of Fethullah Gülen, who Ankara accuses of orchestrating a 2016 coup attempt. “We asked them to extradite 30 terrorists, but they refused to do so,” he said. “So you won’t give us back terrorists, but you ask us for Nato membership? Nato is an entity for security, an organisation for security. Therefore, we cannot say ‘Yes’ to this security organisation being deprived of security,” he added. Erdoğan said Nato had never supported Turkey in its fight against the PKK and other Kurdish militant groups, and accused allies of supporting terrorists, citing allied arms deliveries to the People’s Defence Units (YPG), a Kurdish militia fighting in Syria. Other Turkish officials, including Erdoğan’s spokesperson, have been less outspoken, saying Turkey has not shut the door to Sweden and Finland joining Nato but wants negotiations and a pledge to clamp down on what it sees as terrorist activities. Nato, the US and other allies, as well as Helsinki and Stockholm, have all said they are optimistic they can overcome Turkey’s objections. Analysts believe Erdoğan, who faces elections next year, is largely seeking concessions to score domestic political points and is ultimately unlikely to veto the two Nordic applications. In the hope that speedy ratification by the US would help advance the process, the Swedish defence minister has already headed to Washington. The Turkish foreign minister, Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, met the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, in New York on Wednesday, but the two diplomats did not address the question of Nato enlargement in their joint statement which reaffirmed their cooperation as partners and Nato allies, and committed them “ to working closely together to face current geopolitical challenges”. The Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö, and Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, will meet the US president, Joe Biden, on Thursday. In a statement, Biden said he strongly supported the two countries’ application, adding that he would work with the US Congress and Nato allies “to quickly bring Finland and Sweden into the strongest defensive alliance in history”. Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin, said on a visit to Rome that she hoped alliance members would move “as soon as possible” to ratify the applications. “I think this is the key issue when it comes to security, as fast a ratification process as possible is the best security guarantee for Finland and for Sweden at this stage,” she said. Germany said on Wednesday it would push for the quickest possible accession of Sweden and Finland to Nato. “In these two countries, we gain two valued and capable allies who will further strengthen the defence capability of our alliance,” a government spokesperson said. Rome also said it strongly supports Finland’s and Sweden’s applications and was willing to speed up procedures for the two countries to join as soon as possible, the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, said, calling the applications “a clear response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the threat it poses to peace in Europe”.

Nato head warns over risks of close economic ties with Russia and China,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/24/nato-russia-china-jens-stoltenberg-davos-wef,2022-05-24T11:44:02Z,Jens Stoltenberg tells business leaders in Davos that values should matter more than profits,"The head of Nato has issued a blunt warning of the security risks of close economic ties with Russia and China as he told business leaders in Davos thatvalues should matter more than profits. Jens Stoltenberg, the secretary general of the western military alliance, said countries would be making a mistake if they traded short-term economic gain for long-term security. “Freedom is more important than free trade. The protection of our values is more important than profit,” Stoltenberg told the World Economic Forum. The Nato head said globalisation had brought many economic benefits but the war in Ukraine had exposed how ties with authoritarian regimes created vulnerabilities. Breaking down barriers in the pursuit of free trade had left Europe dependent on Russian oil and gas, involved the sharing of technology that risked the west losing its technological edge in modern weaponry and opened the door to foreign control of vital infrastructure such as 5G networks. “If we share the technology we may earn the money but undermine western security,” Stoltenberg said. “This is about Russia but it is also about China.” As a former prime minister of Norway, Stoltenberg said he had worked to create a more global economy. “But our economic choices have consequences for security,” he said. “I am not arguing against trade with China but I am saying the control over 5G networks is of vital security importance,” he said. “We cannot say that in the interest of profits and free trade we just open up those networks also for suppliers that actually are not reliable when it comes to our security,” Stoltenberg added. The Nato secretary-general said the build up of western forces in eastern Europe was intended to deter Russia from further aggression and there was no intention to become involved in military action. “This is deterrence, not to provoke a conflict but to prevent a conflict and preserve peace,” he said. Vladimir Putin had launched a war to have “less Nato” on his borders, Stoltenberg said. “He is now getting more Nato on his borders and more Nato members.” Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, said Russia’s decision to “weaponise its food supplies” would have global repercussions. Russia was “using hunger and grain to wield power” and blackmail other countries, she added. “In Russian-occupied Ukraine, the Kremlin’s army is confiscating grain stocks and machinery. For some, this has brought back memories from a dark past – the times of the Soviet crop seizures and the devastating famine of the 1930s,” Von der Leyen said in a special address. “Today, Russia’s artillery is bombarding grain warehouses across Ukraine – deliberately. And Russian warships in the Black Sea are blockading Ukrainian ships full of wheat and sunflower seeds,” Von der Leyen added. She said there were 20m tonnes of wheat stuck in Ukraine. That has created a shortage that has sent global wheat prices rocketing, and meant food shipments from Odesa could not reach Somalia. Von der Leyen said Europe was opening solidarity lanes, linking Ukraine’s borders to its ports, stepping up its own production, and working with the World Food Programme to get supplies to vulnerable countries. “Global cooperation is the antidote to Russia’s blackmail,” she said. Achim Steiner, the administrator of the UN Development Programme (UNDP) said 200 million people were facing acute hunger, double the figure of five years ago. “This is very serious,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"US unveils new sanctions on Russia, targeting services, media and defense industry",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/may/08/us-unveils-new-sanctions-on-russia,2022-05-08T16:00:05Z,New measures are primarily intended to close loopholes in existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around Russian economy,"The US has unveiled a new layer of sanctions on Russia, targeting services, Russia’s propaganda machine and its defence industry on the eve of Vladimir Putin’s planned Victory Day parade. The new measures were announced as leaders from the G7 group of industrialised democracies held a virtual summit with Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a show of solidarity. They are primarily intended to close loopholes in the existing sanctions and to tighten the noose around the Russian economy by another few notches. The new sanctions include: A ban on sales of US services to Russia, like accountancy and management consultancy. No more US advertising or sales of broadcasting equipment to three Kremlin-controlled television stations. Technology export bans including industrial engines, bulldozers and other items that can be used by Russian defence factories. Visa restrictions on another 2,600 Russian and Belarusian individuals, including military officials, and executives from Sberbank and Gazprombank.In imposing a ban on services the US is falling into line with the UK, which made a similar announcement last week. The two countries provide the overwhelming bulk of services like accountancy and management consultancy to Russian corporations. The Biden administration sees US service providers as potential tools Russia could use to sidestep the punitive measures already imposed. “They’ve been asked by Russian companies to help them figure out how to reformulate their business strategies in the wake of sanctions, in some cases how to get around these sanctions, or in the case of accountants how to hide some of their wealth, and we’re shutting that down,” a senior administration official said. Like the UK, the restrictive measures do not apply to lawyers, but the US official said that could change, and that Washington and London are coordinating their moves in that respect. “We made a judgment at least for now, that if there was a desire to seek due process through a US lawyer, we would allow that to continue,” the official said. “But we’re reevaluating the breadth of these services sanctions every day, and depending on how we see behavior change over time, we can certainly broaden the sanctions.” The new media sanctions will target three Kremlin-controlled propaganda outlets: Channel One, Russia-1 and NTV. American companies will no longer be allowed to sell equipment like video cameras or microphones to them, and US advertising on their channels will be banned. Last year, US companies bought $300m in advertising in the Russian market. “A lot of these advertisers have announced since the invasion that they’re going to cut their business activity with these stations, but we want to make sure that decision endures and just send a broader signal that US companies should not be in the business of funding Russian propaganda,” senior a senior administration official briefing the press ahead of the announcement. The new technology export bans on industrial items such as heavy engines and bulldozers are intended to have an impact on Russian war efforts by hitting the supply chain for defence manufacturers. The US claims that Russia two major Russian tank plants, Uralvagonzavod Corporation and Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant, have already been forced to halt production due to a lack of foreign components. The 2,600 new visa restrictions on individuals include military officials and Russian proxies deemed to have played a part in the invasion and there will be a new visa policy which would apply automatically to military or proxy officials involved in human rights abuses. The targeted sanctions will also hit eight executives from Sberbank, Russian’s largest financial institution, and 27 from Gazprombank, owned by Russia’s giant gas industry. Until now Gazprombank has been left untouched because of its role in facilitating European purchases of Russian natural gas. “This is not a full block. We’re not freezing the assets of Gazprom bank or prohibiting any transaction with Gazprombank,” the senior administration official said. “What we’re signaling is that Gazprombank is not a safe haven, so we’re sanctioning some of their top business executives, people who sit at the top of the organization, to create a chilling effect.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
 Zelenskiy complains about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/26/russia-ukraine-war-latest-russia-says-it-will-reopen-black-sea-ports-live,2022-05-27T00:13:51Z,"<strong>This live blog is now closed, you can find our latest coverage of the Russia-Ukraine war here</strong>","We will be pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the next few hours. Before we return, here is a comprehensive rundown of where things currently stand. Kharkiv has been hit by fresh strikes amid fears the city is still on Russia’s agenda. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 injured, authorities said. “Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians,” Zelenskiy said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. “The Russian army has thrown all its forces at taking the Luhansk region,” he said in a video on Telegram. “Extremely fierce fighting is taking place on the outskirts of Severodonetsk. They are simply destroying the city, they are shelling it every day, shelling without pause.” The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. A senior Turkish official said Ankara was in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said the Sea of Azov is “forever lost to Ukraine”. Russia’s Ria news agency also quoted a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying that the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions would never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol. The Orwellian turn comes as the Kremlin continued to push forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s “war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty” and said it was “a charged moment for the world”. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces previously said they would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs. “We need more heavy weapons delivered as soon as possible, especially MLRS (multiple launch rocket systems) to repel Russian attacks,” Kuleba said. The US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN. Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry. Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan. “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in his latest national address. “Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives,” he added. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi held a phone call to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the issue of global food security on Thursday. Speaking to journalists after the call, Draghi said he would continue talking to both Moscow and Kyiv to resolve the food crisis, but added that he had little optimism for ending the war. “When asked if I have seen any glimmer of hope for peace, the answer is no,” he said. Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum, according to officials. “The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum,” city official Petro Andryushchenko said. Ukrainian president Zelenskiy has provided a little more information on the recent attack on Kharkiv, which killed at least nine civilians, including a child, and injured 19. Today, the occupiers shelled Kharkiv again. At the moment, the list of the dead includes nine people. 19 wounded. All civilians. A child (five months) and a father were killed. The mother is in grave condition. Among the wounded in Kharkiv is also a nine-year-old girl.” Missile strikes continues in the Sumy region, in Donbas again, he added. “Significant intensification of the occupiers’ artillery in the Zaporizhzhia region again. Again, their efforts to burrow into the ground in the south.” The US is preparing to send advanced, long-range rocket systems to Ukraine after an urgent request from Ukrainian officials, multiple officials reportedly told CNN. The Biden administration is leaning toward sending the systems as part of a larger package of military and security assistance to Ukraine, which could be announced as soon as next week, the outlet reported. Senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, have pleaded in recent weeks for the US and its allies to provide the Multiple Launch Rocket System, or MLRS. The US-made weapon systems can fire a barrage of rockets hundreds of kilometres — much farther than any of the systems Ukraine already has — which the Ukrainians argue could be a game-changer in their war against Russia. Earlier this week, Kuleba said Ukraine’s most urgent need is for multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) to counter Russian superiority in heavy weaponry. Zelenskiy also referred to the weapons as “the systems that are really needed to stop this aggression” in his latest address. Russia has in recent weeks pummelled Ukraine in the east, where Ukraine is outmanned and outgunned, Ukrainian officials said. Another system Ukraine has asked for is the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System, known as HIMARS, a lighter wheeled system capable of firing many of the same types of ammunition as MLRS. A Ukrainian official has said that Russian troops occupying the south-eastern port city of Mariupol have cancelled school summer holidays to prepare pupils for switching to a Russian curriculum. The city fell to Russian forces last week following a weeks-long siege at the Azovstal steel works plant. City official Petro Andryushchenko said: “The occupiers have announced the extension of the school year to September 1. That means no holidays. The main goal is to eradicate everything Ukrainian and prepare for the new school year, which will be according to the Russian curriculum.” “Throughout the summer, children will have to study Russian language, literature and history as well as maths classes in Russian,” Andryushchenko added. He said the city’s Russian leadership were having trouble enlisting teachers to take on the job, with “only 53 teachers for nine schools”. He did not say how many pupils would miss their summer holidays in the city. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has complained about divisions inside the European Union over more sanctions against Russia and asked why some nations were being allowed to block the plan. The EU is discussing a sixth round of punitive measures, including an embargo on Russian oil imports. Such a move requires unanimity but Hungary opposes the idea for now on the grounds its economy would suffer too much. “How many more weeks will the European Union try to agree on a sixth package?” Zelenskiy asked in a late night address on Thursday, noting that Russia was receiving a billion euros a day from the 27-nation bloc for energy supplies. “Of course I am grateful to those friends who are advocating new sanctions. But where do the people blocking this sixth package get their power from? Why are they allowed to hold such power?” he asked. Berlin hopes talks on the new round of sanctions will be completed soon but it will not be a topic at a leaders’ summit next week, a German official said on Wednesday. Pressure on Russia is literally a matter of saving lives. And every day of procrastination, weakness, various disputes or proposals to ‘pacify’ the aggressor at the expense of the victim merely means more Ukrainians being killed,” he said. On Wednesday he savaged suggestions that Kyiv make concessions to bring peace, saying the idea smacked of attempts to appease Nazi Germany in 1938. He also reiterated complaints that the world had so far failed to totally isolate the Russian banking system and was not providing heavy weapons quickly enough. Nine people were killed in Kharkiv Thursday, the regional governor said, and 19 were injured. Governor Oleg Sinegubov said on social media that 19 civilians were injured. Among the dead were a five month old. These, he said, are “the terrible consequences of Russian aggression”. As my colleagues Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo reported earlier: the Russian-speaking city at the border of Ukraine was pounded by artillery for first time in two weeks, just as life there was beginning to to normal. Russian troops had been pushed back over the past few weeks, but remained within arrillery range of the city. Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. At least nine civilians were killed, including a child, and 19 injured by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, regional authorities have said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports.

Without these, we won’t be able to push them back,” he said in a Twitter q &amp; a. Léonie Chao-Fong, Guardian staff Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine’s Foreign Minister, said that “weapons, weapons and weapons again” are what the country needs. Russia still has a weapons advantage, and Ukraine needs “more heavy weapons. Without these, we won’t be able to push them back,” he said in a Twitter q &amp; a. Asked about peace talks, he said: The moment Russia requests a ceasefire will mean only one thing, that Russia is one step away from losing the war. Russia will not request a ceasefire while they are on the offensive. But when they request a ceasefire we will think twice and three times before considering. US officials are questioning Americans who travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, citing domestic security issues, reports Politico’s Besty Woodruff Swan and Christopher Miller: U.S. officials, worried about domestic security issues, have been questioning Americans at airports as they travel to Ukraine to fight Russia, according to an intelligence bulletin reviewed by POLITICO. The document shows that the U.S. government is gathering information about Americans traveling to Ukraine and is interested in their activity after they return. But critics say the focus on “violent extremist-white supremacists” echoes one of the Kremlin’s top propaganda points: that supporting Ukraine means also supporting neo-Nazis. It comes as Washington grapples with a messy challenge: dissuading Americans from fighting alongside soldiers who have received some of their training and many of their weapons from the U.S. itself. The Justice Department has not said whether it’s legal for Americans to join the Ukraine conflict. But no Americans are known to face criminal charges just for traveling to Ukraine to fight Russia, which invaded its neighbor on Feb. 24. This document shows that if law enforcement officials wanted to bring charges, they’ve had plenty of opportunities. Read the full article here. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy will be speaking virtually tomorrow at Stanford University, according to a tweet from a current professor at the school. Michael McFaul, a professor at Stanford and a former US ambassador to Russia, tweeted about Zelenskiy’s impending talk: Here’s a story from the Guardian’s Pjotr Sauer about a Russian soldier’s life as a prisoner of war: Still getting used to the feel of his gun and military fatigues, Anton suddenly found himself surrounded by Ukrainian forces as bullets flew by, with one striking his arm. “It was our first confrontation with the enemy; we hadn’t even fired a shot. They ambushed us, and we couldn’t fight back. We had to surrender,” said Anton, a 21-year-old Russian serviceman, in an interview with the Guardian. Anton was taken captive by Ukrainian forces near Mykolaiv on 2 March with five other soldiers from his unit, as Russian forces were staging an offensive on the strategically important shipbuilding city near the Black Sea. Anton, who asked not to be identified with his real name, would spend the next 45 days in Ukrainian captivity. He was eventually released in mid-April after Moscow arranged a prisoner exchange with Ukraine, and spoke to the Guardian from Russian territory. Anton’s story is a very rare account of a Russian PoW who has since been exchanged, as both Russia and Ukraine have released very little information about the fate of the hundreds of captive Russians. Moscow does not publicise the names of its service people captured in Ukraine. However, during his captivity, Anton was interviewed as a Russian prisoner by a prominent Ukrainian vlogger. He was also named as a captured Russian soldier on websites close to the Ukrainian authorities. Read the full story here. World Health Organization (WHO) member states strongly condemned Russia today for its invasion of Ukraine and attacks on healthcare sites, reports AFP. At WHO’s annual healthcare convention, the resolution condemning Russia was approved by 88 votes, with 12 votes against. A Russian counter-resolution on the health crisis in Ukraine did not get approved. The approved resolution says that it “condemns in the strongest terms” Russia’s “military aggression against Ukraine, including attacks on healthcare facilities”. The resolution also demands Russia “immediately cease any attacks on hospitals” and other healthcare facilities. Ukrainian ambassador Yevheniia Filipenko said that the resolution and vote “sends a clear signal to the Russian Federation: stop your war against Ukraine. Stop attacks on hospitals.” “The World Health Assembly confirmed that the responsibility for the health crisis in Ukraine rests exclusively with the Russian Federation,” added Filipenko. Ukraine’s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said today that the military situation in eastern Ukraine is much worse than people say it is, reports Reuters. During a live question and answer session on Twitter, Kuleba said that the military situation in Ukraine’s eastern part is worse than many people say. Kuleba added that Ukraine still needs heavy weaponry to effective fight Russia. Kharkiv hit by fresh strikes amid fears city is still on Russian agenda This is the latest update on the situation in Kharkiv from Shaun Walker and Lorenzo Tondo: Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least seven people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city. “There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks. The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure. The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre. “For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said. One fascinating aspect of US secretary of state Antony Blinken’s speech on America’s China policy was the promise to use the unity caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a tool in that broader global rivalry. As the AP reports, Blinken thinks the coalition of nations now helping Ukraine against Russia can be mashalled by the US into a broader group opposing Chinese influence: “While the US sees Russia and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war in Ukraine as the most acute and immediate threat to international stability, Blinken said the administration believes China poses a greater danger. “Blinken laid out principles for the administration to marshal its resources, friends and allies to push back on increasing Chinese assertiveness around the world. Although he made clear that the US does not seek to change China’s political system, rather it wants to offer a tested alternative. “This is not about forcing countries to choose, it’s about giving them a choice,” he said. Russia’s defence ministry said civil vessels may safely use the Azov Sea port, in the occupied Ukrainian city of Mariupol, as it had eliminated the danger from mines. The ministry said yesterday that Russian forces had completed removing mines in the port and nearby waters. Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, warned that the western countries supplying weapons to Ukraine capable of hitting Russian territory would be “a serious step towards unacceptable escalation”, Russian state-owned news agency Tass reports. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti quoted Lavrov as saying that he hoped sane people in the west would understand this, adding: There are still a few left there. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, thanked Finland for its support during a surprise visit from the Finnish prime minister, Sanna Marin. Finland’s military assistance is “very valuable”, Zelenskiy wrote on Facebook after talks with Marin, adding: Weapons, sanctions policy and the unity of our partners in the issue of Ukraine’s accession to the EU – this is what can provide strength in the defence of our land. Marin visited the Ukrainian capital as well as the towns of Irpin and Bucha, where Ukraine suspects Russian troops carried out atrocities, an allegation denied by Moscow. Russia’s actions in Ukraine were a “turning point for the entire European family and the whole world”, Marin said after meetings with Zelenskiy and his prime minister. She described Russia’s actions in Ukraine as “an attempt against the principles of building a common European home”, adding: What happened, what Russia did is a turning point for the entire European family and the whole world. We see that the old arrangement has been destroyed and there is no return to the former relationship. A British man who has turned his Polish castle into a makeshift hotel for Ukrainian refugees has accused the UK government of showing “no humanity whatsoever” for not allowing a severely autistic teenager to come to live with an approved foster carer in Lancashire, Helen Pidd and Diane Taylor report. Pleas are mounting for compassion to be shown to Timothy Tymoshenko, 16, who fled the war in Ukraine without his parents. He is living with his 17-year-old brother, Yurii, in what was once a private palace for the prince-bishop of Wrocław in Piotrowice Nyskie, a tiny Polish village near the Czech border. Jim Parton, a former stockbroker and writer from London, lives there with his Polish wife, Anna, and their six children, aged seven to 17. When the Russian invasion began in February, they decided to turn what is usually a guest house and wedding venue into an open house for Ukrainians seeking sanctuary abroad. They are currently hosting 17 people in the sprawling 700-year-old palace, after four left for Canada on Monday. Among those remaining is Timothy, who is severely autistic, non-verbal and needs strong prescription medication to control his changing moods. Experienced children’s carers in Lancashire have been to visit the boys in Poland and are willing to take the brothers in, but are growing increasingly frustrated that the UK government hasn’t yet granted them visas to enter the country. Julie Elliot, 61, and her husband, Roger, 66, already have 14 children together – four biological and 10 adopted. Both worked as nurses before becoming full-time carers to their adopted family, and were made MBEs in 2016 for services to children. Their adopted children, aged between nine and 40, all have disabilities and eight of them still live at the couple’s home in the Ribble Valley, Lancashire. They and Parton are pleading with the Home Office to let Timothy come to the UK along with his brother. They do not qualify for the Homes for Ukraine scheme as unaccompanied children under 18. The issue is the subject of a high court challenge and dozens of UK foster carers are anxiously waiting to see if approval is granted for the children they hope to care for to be brought to the UK. At least seven civilians have been killed and 17 wounded during Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, according to local authorities. Earlier it was reported that five people had died and 10 were injured, including one child, as a result of today’s shelling in Ukraine’s second-largest city. The governor of the Kharkiv region, Oleh Synehubov, reported heavy fighting to the north and north-east of the city. He said: The enemy is again insidiously hitting the civilian population, terrorising them. The claims have not been independently verified. It’s almost 7.30pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the area now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. At least eight civilians were killed and 17 injured, including a child, by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, regional authorities have said. Residents have been urged to go to, or remain in, shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. The Kremlin has rejected claims that Russia has blocked grain exports from Ukraine, blaming the west for creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. A senior Turkish official said Ankara was in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from Russia’s Belgorod region. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, the Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik has said. “That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said the Sea of Azov is “forever lost to Ukraine”. Russia’s Ria news agency also quoted a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying that the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions would never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol. The Orwellian turn comes as the Kremlin continued to push forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, has said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s “war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty” and said it was “a charged moment for the world”. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine. The Belarusian armed forces previously said they would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you as we unpack all the latest developments on the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, spoke with Italy’s prime minister, Mario Draghi, in a phone call earlier this afternoon. In a statement after the call, Rome said the pair discussed the situation in Ukraine, the food crisis and its impact on poor countries. No further details of the call were given. In the Kremlin’s readout of the call, it said Putin told Draghi that Russia was ready to significantly contribute to solving the international food crisis but only if the west lifts sanctions. The Russian leader also said Moscow was ready to continue uninterrupted gas supplies to Italy, the Kremlin said. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, said China’s cooperation with Vladimir Putin after his invasion of Ukraine “raises alarm bells”. In a speech on the Biden administration’s policy towards China at George Washington University, Blinken criticised the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, for defending Putin’s war on Ukraine. Blinken said: Even while Russia was clearly mobilising to invade Ukraine, President Xi and President Putin declared that the friendship between their countries was, and I quote, ‘without limits’. He emphasised that the US did not want another cold war and did not support Taiwanese independence. But he said: Beijing’s defence of President Putin’s war to erase Ukraine’s sovereignty and secure a sphere of influence in Europe should raise alarm bells for all of us who call the Indo-Pacific region home. This is a charged moment for the world. Alexander Lukashenko, the Belarusian president who is a close Putin ally, has ordered the creation of a new military command for the south of the country bordering Ukraine, Belarus’s state-owned news agency Belta reports. Lukashenko was quoted by Belta as saying: Regretfully, a new direction has opened, a new front as they say, and we cannot neglect it. Earlier this month, the Belarusian armed forces said it would deploy special operations troops in three areas near its southern border with Ukraine. Minsk has complained about Nato allies amassing soldiers near its borders - Poland, Lithuania and Latvia are all members of the alliance - and is increasing the amount and intensity of its own military exercises in response. Lukashenko has also talked up the role of Russian-made missiles in boosting the country’s defences. Russia has deployed mobile propaganda vans with large-screen televisions to humanitarian aid points in the captured city of Mariupol as the Kremlin has pushed forward with efforts to integrate newly occupied territories across the south of Ukraine. Videos published by the Russian ministry of emergency situations showed the vans, which it called “mobile information complexes”, playing state TV news segments and political chatshows where pundits support the invasion to locals in the ruined city that still lacks electricity and running water. The Orwellian turn comes as much of Mariupol was destroyed in an artillery bombardment that left thousands dead.

s deployed near the ruins of the Mariupol drama theatre, where hundreds were killed in an airstrike in March. Several of the trucks now patrol the city, mainly playing Russian television news segments. “The people of Mariupol have been held in a virtual informational vacuum for three months due to the lack of electricity,” wrote the emergencies ministry in a statement. The mobile screens have reportedly been deployed to places where Mariupol residents are receiving humanitarian aid, Russian documents, and at points in the city where drinking water is available. “The practice of ‘there is nothing to eat, so feed them lies’ is gaining momentum,” wrote Petro Andryushchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian mayor of Mariupol. It’s “cynicism of the highest level”. “The truth and the propaganda,” wrote Anton Gerashenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior ministry, posting a video of the trucks superimposed over images of the ruins of the city. This is “the Russian world”, he added. The UK government introduced legislation on Thursday to help councils, NHS trusts and other public bodies exit contracts with Gazprom and other Russian companies, Alex Lawson and Pamela Duncan report. Councils have been keen to withdraw from contracts amid concerns they were helping to fund Vladimir Putin’s regime. They had been prohibited from taking “non-commercial considerations” into account when procuring or terminating contracts, and they have a statutory duty to find the cheapest deal on behalf of the taxpayer. Many councils had been forced to select Gazprom as a supplier because it offered the greatest value for money. They paid £29m to Gazprom from 2016 to 2021, data firm Tussell has said. In March the Cabinet Office asked central government to review all contracts with Russia and Belarus-linked firms and to consider terminating those contracts. This process has been extended to local councils. Councils including Merton and Telford and Wrekin have said they are keen to cut ties with Russia. A government source said: “Local authorities are not obliged to terminate contracts, but our message is clear: Putin’s barbaric regime should not benefit from taxpayers’ money.” Michael Gove will write to all councils to make them aware of the changes. The government has said any costs incurred from exiting contracts will have to be covered by existing budgets. The west is attempting to choke off the Russian economy to damage Putin’s war coffers and fuel anti-war sentiment among the Russian public. Natalia Popova, adviser to the head of the Kharkiv regional council, has posted an updated set of casualty figures for the shelling of Kharkiv today. She said on Facebook: “Ten wounded. Among the wounded, one child. Five people died.” She urged people to go to or to remain in shelters. The claims have not been independently verified. Peter Beaumont has this latest report of the overall situation in the war on Ukraine: Ukrainians in the eastern Donbas region are burying dead civilians in mass graves in the face of a concerted assault by Russia, which is reportedly holding about 8,000 prisoners of war in the provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk. Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken by Russian forces, Ukraine’s general staff reported that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka. The governor of the Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the region remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% just over a week ago. Haidai added that police in Lysychansk were burying the bodies of civilians in mass graves, with about 150 people having been buried in such a grave in one district. If confirmed, the continuing Russian advances in Lyman, which has been contested for a month, would make it easier for Russian forces to isolate the key city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under relentless shelling for days. According to accounts posted on social media, Lyman’s Ukrainian defenders had pulled back to the southern outskirts, although fighting was continuing, in particular around the railway sidings in the town. Read more of Peter Beaumont’s report here: Ukrainians burying civilians in mass graves as Russia advances A senior Ukrainian official has conceded that Russia at present has the upper hand in fighting in Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region. Gen Oleksiy Gromov said at a briefing: Russia has the advantage, but we are doing everything we can. He added that Russia has been spotted moving Iskander missile systems to Belarus’s western Brest region. This raised the possibility of new missile strikes on west Ukraine, Gromov said. St Petersburg’s anti-war protesters want to send a message to those “who are still silent”. As the women protest against Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, reactions are varied from passersby: some stop to whisper their gratitude, and others castigate them as traitors. At least four civilians were killed and several injured by Russian shelling in the city of Kharkiv in north-east Ukraine, according to the regional governor. Writing on Telegram, Oleh Synyehubov urged residents of the city to go to shelters. Turkey is in “ongoing” talks with Russia and Ukraine to open a corridor via the Bosphorus for grain exports from Ukraine, according to a senior Turkish official. The official, requesting anonymity because the talks were confidential, told Reuters: Turkey is negotiating with both Russia and Ukraine for the export of grains from Ukraine. With a corridor to be opened from Turkey, there was a demand for this grain to reach their targeted markets. Negotiations are still ongoing. Two other sources confirmed that Turkey was in talks to help the grains be shipped out of Ukraine. Although a Nato member, Turkey was seen as more “neutral” than other western alliance members, one person said. A senior diplomat said yesterday: Turkey is ready to contribute to a kind of monitoring of these exports from Odesa through the Black Sea because Turkey traditionally is very strong in the Black Sea and they are ready to help. The UK’s foreign minister, Liz Truss, accused Vladimir Putin of “weaponising” hunger through Russia’s blockade of Ukrainian grain exports. Speaking during a visit to Bosnia Herzegovina, Truss was asked whether she supported lifting sanctions in exchange for grain exports from Ukraine. Truss replied: It is completely appalling that Putin is trying to hold the world to ransom. He is essentially weaponising hunger and lack of food amongst the poorest people around the world. We simply cannot allow this to happen. Putin needs to remove the blockade on Ukrainian grain. She added: What we cannot have is any lifting of sanctions, any appeasement, which will simply make Putin stronger in the longer term. Journalists from western countries will be expelled from Russia if YouTube blocks access to Moscow’s foreign ministry’s briefings, the ministry said. Russian foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova, who holds a weekly briefing, said the ministry had warned YouTube against blocking her content. Zakharova was quoted by the Russian state-owned news agency Tass as saying: We just came and told them: ‘You block another briefing, one journalist or American media outlet goes home. Another briefing is blocked and we will name a specific journalist or specific media outlet that will go home.’ She added that Moscow was working on measures against English-language media in response to what it considered “unfriendly actions” by foreign governments towards Russian news outlets. She did not provide further details. Zakharova’s comments came after Russian lawmakers approved a bill giving prosecutors powers to shut foreign media bureaus if a western country has been “unfriendly” to Russian media. The measure is meant to retaliate for the closure of some Russian state news outlets in the west. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been speaking during his regular briefing where he rejected claims that Russia had blocked grain exports from Ukraine. Instead, Peskov accused the west of creating such a situation by imposing sanctions on Russia. Peskov told reporters: We categorically do not accept these accusations. On the contrary, we blame Western countries for taking actions that have led to this. Ukrainian ports in the Black Sea have been blocked since Russia’s invasion on 24 February, leaving more than 20m tons of grain stuck in silos in the country. Yesterday, Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said the Kremlin would allow ships carrying food to leave Ukrainian ports in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two captured Russian soldiers have pleaded guilty to shelling a town in eastern Ukraine, in the second war crimes trial since Russian troops invaded the country. Alexander Bobikin and Alexander Ivanov acknowledged being part of an artillery unit that fired at targets in the Kharkiv region from the Belgorod region in Russia. The shelling destroyed an educational establishment in the town of Derhachi, the prosecutors said. Bobikin and Ivanov, described as an artillery driver and a gunner, were captured after crossing the border and continuing the shelling, the prosecutor general’s office said. At the trial in the Kotelevska district court in central Ukraine, Bobikin told the court: I am completely guilty of the crimes of which I am accused. We fired at Ukraine from Russia. Ivanov asked not to be handed the maximum jail term, telling the court: I repent and ask for a reduction in the sentence. State prosecutors asked for the pair to be jailed for 12 years for violating the laws of war. A defence lawyer asked for leniency, arguing that two soldiers had been following orders and repented. The verdict is expected on 31 May. Hello, it is Léonie Chao-Fong here in London taking over from Martin Belam with all the latest news from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow was ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20m tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by the Russian Tass news agency as saying. Denis Pushilin, head of the breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has said they cannot yet be 100% sure they have flushed every last Ukrainian fighter out of the Azovstal steel plant. The deputy prime minister of the Russian-appointed Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said: “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine.” He is reported to have said: “Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation.” Russia’s ministry of defence claims that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed, and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled. Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion. Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war. Ukraine’s governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has said fighting is most intense in the Izyum region. He claimed: “The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk.” Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday. Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, has told the World Economic Forum in Davos that he believes Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. He said everyone in the world understands it is not “a special operation”, but that it is a genocide against the Ukrainian people. The German chancellor, Olaf Scholz, has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was a thunderbolt, and that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms. British foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to urge Britain’s allies to remain strong in support of Ukraine and not to appease Putin, in a speech later today. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I am handing over to my colleague Léonie Chao-Fong. My colleague Graeme Wearden is in Davos, where the German chancellor Olaf Scholz is speaking: Olaf Scholz has told the World Economic Forum that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on 24 February was a thunderbolt, and that Vladimir Putin cannot be allowed to win or to dictate peace terms. A nuclear power is acting as if it has the right to redraw borders, he said. This is imperialism, threatening to to take us back to a time when war was a common instrument of politics. We cannot allow Putin to win this war, and I firmly believe he will not win it, Scholz said. The prospect of Russia capturing all of Ukraine seems less likely than at the start of the war, Germany’s chancellor says, thanks to the Ukrainian forces and support from international community. Finland and Sweden are looking to join Nato, and we would welcome them with open arms, Scholz says. He says Germany is providing heavy weapons to Ukraine, and Scholz believes that Putin will only seriously negotiate peace when he believes he cannot break Ukraine’s defences. Russia must not be allowed to dictate the peace terms, Scholz said. Serhiy Haidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has posted a situation update to Telegram. He states: On 25 May the Russians lead a powerful and long-lasting artillery attack on Lysychansk. They attempted to storm our defence near Ustynivka at the same time destroying this village and Lysychansk nearby by artillery As a result, two died in Ustynivka and one in Lysychansk. A shell hit the humanitarian aid centre, and a volunteer car that delivered food to Luhansk region was damaged. Eleven high-rises, the building of ‘Impulse’ in Sievierodonetsk, eight high-rises and private houses, a house of culture and the Administration Services Centre in Lysychansk, four houses in Privillya, two in Novodruzhesk and Hirske each were destroyed. Now the enemy is trying to gain a foothold near Sievierodonetsk. On 25 May overall, 10 Russian attacks were repelled, four tanks, two artillery systems, an armoured personnel carrier, a motor vehicle and one unit of special equipment were destroyed. Air defence units shot down five UAVs ‘Orlan-10’. The claims have not been independently verified. Isobel Koshiw reports for us from Kyiv on the anarchists joining Ukraine’s struggle against Russia: In an unnamed basement bar in central Kyiv, Ukrainian anarchists have created a headquarters where they gather supplies to send to their peers on the frontlines and welcome anarchists from abroad who have come to fight. It is unusual to see anarchists supporting state structures, but they say taking action against Russia is necessary for their own survival. “We are fighting to protect the more or less free society that exists in Ukraine,” said an activist, Dmytro. “Without which there would be no space for activism or underground movements.” He added: “Putin’s terror is happening [in Ukraine] and it is indiscriminate. It is happening against every part of the population, but especially against the Russian-speaking parts of the population that Putin supposedly came here to liberate,” referring to the fact that the war has been heaviest in eastern and southern Ukraine. “His regime is an ultraconservative, rightwing dictatorship that represses anarchists in Russia, the free press, LGBT networks. It scares even the most banal, grass-roots initiatives, like animal rights activists. We see the conflict between Ukraine and Russia as a conflict between a more or less democratic state and a totalitarian one.” Read more of Isobel Koshiw’s report from Kyiv: ‘Putin’s terror affects everyone’ – anarchists join Ukraine’s war effort Russia’s military have issued their operational briefing for the day. Among the claims – which have not been independently verified – are: “High-precision air-based missiles hit 48 areas of concentration of manpower and military equipment of the armed forces of Ukraine.” “In the area of the settlement of Dneprovskoe, Mykolaiv region, the Ukrainian center of electronic intelligence was destroyed, including 11 military personnel of the combat crew, as well as 15 foreign specialists who arrived with the protection of engineering and operational staff.” “Russian air defence systems shot down one Ukrainian Mi-24 helicopter over the village of Gusarovka, Kharkiv region. Also, a military transport aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force, which was delivering ammunition and weapons, was shot down in the air in the Kremidovka region of the Odessa region.” The Russians also claim that as a result of their operations in the last 24 hours, more than 350 Ukrainian fighters were killed, and 96 units of weapons and military equipment were disabled. The Russian ministry of defence have also published two videos this morning. One of which claims to show a series of Ukrainian defence trenches which had been seized by Russian forces. The other shows the launching of an OTRK “Iskander” missile, which Russia claims can hit targets up to 500km away and is “impossible” to detect. The governor of Kharkiv, Oleh Synyehubov, has issued an update on his region on Telegram. He reported: A 62-year-old man was injured in the shelling in the Pyatihatok district of Kharkiv last night. Balakliya was shelled: ten people, including a nine-year-old child, were injured. Two people died: men aged 64 and 82. Only a nine-year-old girl was taken from Balaklia to Kharkiv, she is in stable serious condition. Other patients were hospitalised in Kupyansk CDH. Russian occupiers fired on Zircons, burned houses, one victim. Also one victim of shelling of Chuguiv district. This morning Zolochiv community and Slatine were fired upon again, Dergachiv community - two wounded. He went on to say: Our armed forces of Ukraine are fighting intensively against the Russian occupiers. The hottest in the Izyum region. The Russians are trying to improve the tactical situation in the area of the city of Izyum and resume the offensive on Slovyansk. Denis Pushilin, head of the self-proclaimed breakaway Donetsk People’s Republic, has given an interview to Russia’s RIA Novosti in which he has said he cannot be certain that all Ukrainian forces have been expelled from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. They quote him saying: No, it’s impossible. They could hide physically, they could be lost somewhere. For now, we thoroughly check every nook and cranny of Azovstal, and there the territory is quite serious. I will not say that they are 100% there, or 100% have already been cleared. After our units check everything, clear mines, after they clear all the rubble that is there, after that we can say … there is absolutely no one left. Graeme Wearden is in Davos, where Kyiv’s mayor is speaking: Vitali Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, begins his briefing by saying that Russia still hopes to take control of the Ukrainian capital. It is clear that it is not a special military operation, as Russia claims, but war, one of the biggest since the second world war, he says. Thousands of people have died, including a lot of children, Klitschko says, with a huge battle raging in the East of Ukraine. It is no secret that Russia’s priority is to occupy the whole country, and their main target is still the capital of Ukraine, the heart of the country, the former heavyweight champion says. He says the whole world has seen the evidence from satellite cities such as Bucha. Everyone understands, it’s not a special operation.. it is the genocide of the Ukranian people, Klitschko says, with children, women, and old people killed. And he explains the human suffering, saying it is difficult to understand how people can lose their home in a moment - or suddenly lose friends, relatives, or parents. Dr Svitlana Krakovska, head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), believes the reconstruction of cities bombed in the invasion can be an example to the rest of Europe. Speaking yesterday at a panel session in Davos organised by the Arctic Basecamp group of climate scientists, Dr Krakovska said: We have a big disaster in our country, we have so many people killed, our cities destroyed. But these destroyed cities are our opportunity, to rebuild them in a climate-resilient way. To do this we will need the support of all the international community, financial support and technology support as well. So we are looking forward to having Ukraine as a role model for Europe. Dr Krakovska received a medal from Ukraine’s Volodymyr president Zelenskiy last year for her work on rising global temperatures, including visiting the Antarctic to monitor the impact of climate change there. Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, has posted a status update for the day. He said that there was one air alert overnight, but there were no strikes reported. He also said that for the first time since Lviv started accepting displaced people from elsewhere in Ukraine, there was not a single person who registered for temporary accommodation yesterday. The impact of the war in Ukraine has been a strong theme running through the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this week. Today, in about half-an-hour, Vitaliy Klitschko, mayor of Kyiv, will be speaking about how to rebuild the Ukrainian capital after the war, and what aid will be needed. My colleague Graeme Wearden is there, and he will be covering that live on our business blog. I’ll bring you the top lines here. The deputy prime minister of the Crimean government, Georgy Muradov, has said “The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine” according to reports from Russia’s RIA Novosti news agency. They quote him saying: The Sea of Azov is forever lost to Ukraine. Ports in the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never again be Ukrainian. I am sure that after the reunification of our regions with Russia, the Sea of Azov will again, as it was before, become exclusively an inland sea of the Russian Federation The agency also quotes Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-appointed official in the occupied Zaporizhzhia region as saying the same – that Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions will never be returned to the control of the Kyiv. Russia annexed Crimea after invading in 2014. Ukraine has repeatedly said that it will not enter any peace deal that does not restore its borders. Vladimir Putin ally Dmitry Medvedev has said that Russia will not accept any settlement that does not recognise Crimea as Russian territory. There are about 8,000 Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russian-backed self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People’s Republics, Luhansk official Rodion Miroshnik was quoted by Tass news agency as saying on Thursday, according to Reuters. “There are a lot of prisoners. Of course, there are more of them on the territory of Donetsk People’s Republic, but we also have enough, and now the total number is somewhere in the region of 8,000. That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day,” Miroshnik said. This is Martin Belam taking over from my colleagues in Australia. I can be reached at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russia’s failure to anticipate Ukrainian resistance and the subsequent complacency of Russian commanders has led to significant losses across many of Russia’s more elite units, according to Britain’s Ministry of Defence in its latest intelligence update on the war. It notes that Russia’s elite airborne forces – the VDV – have been heavily involved in several notable tactical failures since the start of Russia’s invasion such as the failure to capture Hostomel airfield near Kyiv and the recent “failed and costly crossings of the Siverskyi Donets river”. The MoD analysts say that the VDV “has been employed on missions better suited to heavier armoured infantry and has sustained heavy casualties during the campaign. Its mixed performance likely reflects a strategic mismanagement of this capability and Russia’s failure to secure air superiority”. It concludes that the misemployment of the VDV in Ukraine shows how Vladimir utin’s huge investment in his armed forces in recent years has resulted in “an unbalanced overall force”. Our diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, has more on the speech British foreign secretary Liz Truss plans to make in Bosnia on Thursday. She is expected to urge Britain’s allies to remain strong in support of Ukraine and not to appease Vladimir Putin. It comes as Ukraine’s president Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed for more weapons from the west to stave off Russia’s onslaught in the Donbas region. Here’s Patrick’s dispatch: Amidst growing discussion about an early diplomatic settlement to the war in Ukraine involving a loss of territory to Russia, Truss will say the West must not take their feet off the accelerator or else a more prolonged and bloody conflict will ensue. In a visit to Bosnia Herzegovina she will insist “we must all learn the lesson of history” in standing up to Putin. She makes no criticism of a specific country, but it is known there is growing frustration amongst countries that take the hardest line in support of Ukraine that Germany and Hungary are not doing more to back Ukraine either by supplying heavy weapons or allowing an EU wide embargo on Russian oil imports to be started. The German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock on Wednesday warned of a fatigue in Europe with the war, and growing public concern about rising food and energy prices. Truss in a speech to Bosnia and Herzegovina armed forces at Sarajevo’s Army Hall, will say: “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength. We must not allow a prolonged and increasingly painful conflict to develop in Ukraine. We must be relentless in ensuring Ukraine prevails through military aid and sanctions. We can’t take our foot off the accelerator now.” Britain has been one the countries leading in support for Ukraine, and Truss within the British cabinet has been one of the most uncompromising On Friday she will travel to Prague for talks with Foreign Minister Jan Lipavský where she will praise the Czechs for supplying tanks to Ukraine. The Czechs are due to be compensated by Germany supplying tanks to replace those sent to Ukraine On Tuesday the Polish President Andrzej Duda on Tuesday accused the German government of breaking its word on an agreement to supply Warsaw with new tanks as compensation for Polish deliveries of Soviet-era tanks to Ukraine. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz last month introduced the so-called “Ringtausch,” a swap scheme under which eastern NATO partners would supply the Ukrainian army with Soviet-era tanks like the T-72 in exchange for modern western tanks from German manufacturers, such as the Leopard. Germany is due to deliver 14 Leopard 2A4 main battle tanks and one Leopard tank recovery vehicle to Prague under the swap scheme. A Russian soldier who was held as a prisoner of war in Ukraine for 45 days before being allowed to return home has told about the toll being in captivity has taken on his mind and body. Speaking to Pjotr Sauer, our correspondent in Russia, the soldier, from Siberia, said he received very little military training and was shocked when he was told his unit was going into Ukraine. When he was captured he said he was not physically harmed but suffered mental torment from his Ukrainian captors. “We were constantly told that Russia is finished, that we belonged to the bottom of society. They would threaten to starve us.” The every-day boredom was the hardest thing. “If we were lucky, we would be given something random to read. Sometimes they let us watch Ukrainian propaganda on television. “Most days we would just stare at the walls in front of us,” he said, adding that he was moved three times during his captivity. Read Pjotr’s full report here: Russia is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions, the Interfax news agency cited Russian deputy foreign minister Andrei Rudenko as saying. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February. More than 20m tonnes of grain are stuck in silos in the country, raising concerns about famine in countries dependent on the supplies. Western powers have been discussing the idea of setting up “safe corridors” for grain exports from Ukraine’s ports, although these would need Russian consent. “We have repeatedly stated on this point that a solution to the food problem requires a comprehensive approach, including the lifting of sanctions that have been imposed on Russian exports and financial transactions,” Rudenko was quoted as saying. “And it also requires the demining by the Ukrainian side of all ports where ships are anchored. Russia is ready to provide the necessary humanitarian passage, which it does every day.” UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say, noting how appeasement of Russian president Vladimir Putin after his wars in Georgia and Crimea has not worked. Hello. I’m Martin Farrer and welcome to our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you’re just waking up or dropping in to catch up on what’s been happening, here are some of the latest developments: Ukraine’s president and foreign minister have pleaded with the west to send more weapons to their military in the face of Russia’s intensifying assault on the eastern Donbas region. “We need the help of our partners – above all, weapons for Ukraine. Full help, without exceptions, without limits, enough to win,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Dmytro Kuleba told the World Economic Forum in Davos that Nato was doing “virtually nothing” to help Ukraine. Russian forces have launched fresh assaults on towns in eastern Ukraine, with the city of Sievierodonetsk increasingly in danger of being totally encircled. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said the area was now without gas supplies and had limited water and electricity after the last gas supply station was hit. Russian forces shelled more than 40 other towns in Donbas on Wednesday, Ukraine’s military said, threatening to shut off the last main escape route for civilians trapped in the path of their invasion. UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is expected to call on Thursday for further military aid and sanctions to help Ukraine during a trip to Bosnia and Herzegovina. “Russia’s aggression cannot be appeased. It must be met with strength,” Truss is expected to say. Russia’s deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, said Moscow is ready to provide a humanitarian corridor for vessels carrying food to leave Ukraine, in return for the lifting of some sanctions. Ukraine’s Black Sea ports have been blocked since Russia invaded, with more than 20 million tonnes of grain stuck in silos in the country. Kuleba, poured scorn on Moscow’s claim and accused Russia of trying to “blackmail the world”. Zelenskiy rejected the notion that his country should cede territory to make peace with Russia. He criticised a New York Times editorial that suggested Ukraine must compromise by giving up territory in exchange for peace. he said in his latest nightly address. Those who advise Ukraine to give up territory fail to see the ordinary people, he said, “who actually live in the territory they propose to exchange for the illusion of peace.” Ukraine’s foreign ministry said Moscow’s plan to simplify the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied regions violates international law. The ministry’s statement came after Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, signed a decree simplifying the process of handing Russian citizenship to residents of Ukraine’s Russian-occupied Kherson and Zaporizhzhia region. Russian lawmakers have voted to approve a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Zelenskiy responded: “(They) no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight.” A senior United Nations official is due to visit Moscow in the coming days to discuss reviving fertiliser exports, Russia’s UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said, stressing that the talks were not linked to a resumption of Ukrainian grain shipments, Reuters reported. Two alleged Wagner Group fighters from Belarus have been accused of murdering civilians near Kyiv, making them the first international mercenaries to face war crimes charges in Ukraine. Ukrainian prosecutors have released the names and photographs of eight men wanted for alleged war crimes – including murder and torture – in the village of Motyzhyn. Several are believed to have fought in Syria. Estonian prime minister Kaja Kallas said it would be “much more dangerous giving in to Putin than provoking him” during a speech in Stockholm and warned: “All these seemingly small concessions to the aggressor lead to big wars. We have done this mistake already three times: Georgia, Crimea and Donbas.” Russia’s foreign ministry spokesperson, Maria Zakharova," said an Italian peace plan for Ukraine was a “fantasy”. Zakharova said at her weekly briefing: “You can’t supply Ukraine with weapons with one hand and come up with plans for a peaceful resolution of the situation with the other.”""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine players show their nation’s culture is alive and kicking | Nick Ames,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jun/01/ukraine-players-show-their-nations-culture-is-alive-and-kicking,2022-06-01T07:00:11Z,The World Cup playoff semi-final in Scotland is a reminder that the war-torn country’s identity and football heritage are intact,"It would not be a huge surprise if the ball that scored Ukraine’s first official goal was still travelling. They were 3-0 down against Hungary in the western city of Uzhhorod when, with virtually the final action, Ivan Hetsko lined up a free-kick just beyond the edge of the “D” and struck it with such shuddering force that it rebounded straight out of the net. The strike meant nothing and everything: it was 29 April 1992 and Ukraine would take some years to assemble a committed XI in the post-USSR shakedown, but Hetsko’s thunderbolt had given them a form of lift-off. “It was very difficult for us at first and I think we are in a similar position now,” says Myron Markevych, who was overseeing Volyn Lutsk in the inaugural Ukrainian championship back then and later managed the national team. “Except we had to begin from zero then, and today we are basically starting from minus two.” When Ukraine face Scotland at Hampden Park it will be less a rebirth than a reminder that, much as Russia might wish to erase the country’s cultural identity, its football heritage remains truly alive. The act of playing for a World Cup place on Wednesday night, and over the next five days if all goes well, is both one of defiance and of expectation that, despite everything, good things can lie ahead. But Markevych is right: Ukraine approach the tie from a standing start at best and it would be a seismic achievement if an undercooked, though highly talented, team can overcome battle-hardened opponents in both Glasgow and Cardiff. “The team has been training here for a month, and before the war I was at a training camp with Shakhtar, so I have the impression that this is one continuous training camp,” said Andriy Pyatov, the veteran goalkeeper, before Ukraine left the facility in Slovenia where many of the squad had been working since early May. “There is a little fatigue, but everyone understands we have a big goal.” Ukraine have played friendlies against Borussia Mönchengladbach, Empoli and Rijeka but no fellow national team could offer a warm-up. Before training in Slovenia their Shakhtar and Dynamo Kyiv players had played charity games around Europe but, as the coach Oleksandr Petrakov has pointed out, there has been nothing to rival the edge of competitive football. Players such as Oleksandr Zinchenko, Andriy Yarmolenko, Vitaliy Mykolenko, the Benfica forward Roman Yaremchuk and Atalanta’s gifted Ruslan Malinovskyi will add an injection of match fitness now their domestic seasons are over; it is impossible to predict how sharp the collective will be, though, even if around half of them have had the benefit of extended time together. But the mind and body can do extraordinary things. “They will have the motivation,” Markevych says. “It will be at the highest level. The players understand the situation, they know how important this is. Whether or not we win, they will try to do everything.” Soldiers serving on the front line have, through frequent communications with the squad, made it clear football does matter in some way even as the horror remains so real in swathes of the country. There is every chance sheer adrenaline and emotion may override rustiness; the key to the outcome will lie in how that is reified. A few days ago Yaremchuk apologised for posing last summer, alongside Mykolenko, with a Russian rapper who had previously performed in occupied Crimea. Now the national team listen only to Ukrainian music, he explained. “[The national team] has changed in this aspect, they’ve become quite patriotic.” There has been a concerted effort among the squad to speak Ukrainian rather than Russian, the first language of many from the heavily-populated east and south. In other areas of society an unyielding embrace of national pride and values has brought astonishing feats of resistance, bravery and, relative to an appalling situation, success. The players hope football will be the next reflection of that. Many of them have memories of winning at Hampden. Eleven months ago Artem Dovbyk, the sought-after Dnipro striker, scored late in extra time against Sweden to give Ukraine a place in the Euro 2020 quarter-finals. That familiarity is something else to harness and so is the fact that, ignoring the context, this team would ordinarily start as slight favourites. “If the players are in good condition we have a chance,” Markevych says. “We have good players, maybe better than Scotland’s in some areas. We believe in them and they must play the best match, hopefully two matches, of their careers.” Markevych’s spell at the Sbirna helm, in 2010, ended swiftly but he played a significant role in the country’s post-independence ascent to footballing renown. His exciting Metalist Kharkiv team were Europa League mainstays during his nine years in charge and, in 2015, he took Dnipro to a narrow defeat in the final against Sevilla. He speaks nostalgically of the period between then and 1999, when a brilliant Dynamo Kyiv side reached the Champions League semi-finals; in the middle, Ukraine were World Cup quarter-finalists in 2006. “They were the golden times of Ukrainian football,” he says. “Now we will do everything to bring them back.” Should any of Petrakov’s team manage to channel the sheer power and accuracy Hetsko provided three decades ago, their return may appear closer than anyone could have expected; for Ukraine, though, one form of victory comes in the fact of being here at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Germany to relax visa rules for Russian workers despite  spy warning,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/germany-to-relax-visa-rules-for-russian-workers-despite-spy-warning,2022-05-23T13:37:12Z,Process to be eased to exempt applicants with special expertise from case-by-case assessment,"Germany is to relax visa requirements for skilled workers from Russia, just as the country’s domestic intelligence agency warned of a heightened risk that Russian nationals working for German firms could be recruited for industrial espionage. The chancellor Olaf Scholz’s government is streamlining the visa application process by exempting Russian workers with specialised expertise in areas such as IT and communication technology from case-by-case assessments through the federal employment department. The so-called “global approval for access to the labour market”, which applies only to Russian employees of German companies who are earning at least €43,992 a year, will last until 30 September. Between the start of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the beginning of May, Germany issued more than 600 visas for Russian skilled workers, which allow for a longer stay in Germany than the 90-day so-called Schengen visa. The German foreign office told the news agency dpa it had issued about 350 work visas via its Moscow embassy in April, in addition to a further 190 working visas issued by the general consulate in St Petersburg. Most of those in receipt of such visas were already working for German firms, dpa said. Germany is already home to about 235,000 Russian passport holders, more than any other country in the European Union. Only last week, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution issued a special warning that Russian nationals who were about to move to Germany, and those already working in the country, faced an increased risk of being blackmailed or otherwise put under pressure to collect information of use to a Russian economy increasingly cut off from global knowledge networks. “Russia is increasingly isolated through the sanctions imposed in reaction to the war in Ukraine”, the report said. “Its economy is cut off from the knowhow and technologies of the west.” Recruitment attempts could take place during mandatory appointments with Russian embassies or other bureaucratic bodies, Germany’s domestic intelligence agency said. “They may also try to exercise pressure via reprisals against relatives or acquaintances who have remained in Russia”, the report continued. “In general, Russian intelligence services do not shy away from methods like threats and blackmail.” Asked if the German government was introducing special measures to vet Russian working visa applicants, a spokesperson said: “Standard security checks of applicants are being made within the visa process.” The decision to ease entry for Russian skilled workers comes as human rights NGOs said the German government was not doing enough to ease the visa application process for independent journalists facing repression in Russia. About 70 Russian journalists and media professionals, most of them employees of the independent Russian TV channel Dozhd and the news website Meduza, have been put on a humanitarian visa list drawn up by the German culture ministry but do not yet qualify for the more generous visas for skilled workers. “We want to offer Russian journalists who are being persecuted in Russia protection in Germany,” a spokesperson for the interior minister, Nancy Faeser, said on Monday. “We want to ease entry and speed up processes.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of Ukrainian refugees removed from UK’s ‘unsuitable’ housing sponsors,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/08/hundreds-of-ukrainian-refugees-removed-from-uks-unsuitable-housing-sponsors,2022-05-08T08:00:24Z,Homes for Ukraine scheme ‘unravelling’ as government seeks new accommodation for 600 people at risk of being exploited by hosts ,"The government is scrambling to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme because the people they were supposed to stay with have been deemed “unsuitable”, the Observer can reveal. Refugee charities have warned since the scheme’s launch that with most of the refugees being women and children, and many matches made on social media websites such as Facebook, the scheme risked being targeted by predatory men. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC), which runs the scheme, has insisted that no visa is issued until the Home Office has completed checks on every adult in a sponsor household. However, a source with links to the DLUHC told the Observer that the department is “looking for bridging accommodation for a group of 600 refugees who have come to the UK, but the people they have come to stay with have been found to be unsuitable”. This included sponsors with a criminal record. The refugees have been placed in hotels as an emergency option, the source said, but ministers are looking for better options, including university student accommodation, until they are matched with new families. A second source, who also spoke to the Observer on condition of anonymity, said: “These 600 Ukrainian refugees had been granted visas, but their sponsors were found to be unsuitable either because they had a criminal record or for some other reason.” Robina Qureshi, director of Positive Action in Housing, a charity that set up the UK’s first refugee hosting programme and is matching 1,000 Ukrainians with families across the UK, said it was no surprise that the government’s scheme had “unravelled so quickly”. “It’s a free-for-all matching system,” she said. “We don’t agree with social media as a tool for meeting vulnerable people like this.” Qureshi is concerned that a predatory single man who is only interested in hosting a young, single Ukrainian woman would not be caught out by DBS checks. She said: “Refugees have been led along by people saying they are registered for Homes for Ukraine, which sounds like some official guarantee when that isn’t the case.” Yvonne Kachikoti, head of resettlement and integration services at charity Refugee Action, said: “The government’s reckless and unregulated approach to matching has put vulnerable refugees at considerable risk of ending up in the homes of people planning to exploit them.” She added: “Already traumatised families forced to leave their Homes for Ukraine host after a nasty experience are unlikely to want to be rematched with another sponsor.” The Local Government Association says it has been flagging up the “inevitability” of some unsuitable accommodation being offered since the start of the Homes for Ukraine scheme. Its chair, councillor James Jamieson, said: “We are asking the government to give us information on sponsors prior to matching, so we can get ahead of the game in making checks.” He said councils had been getting more advance information in the past 10 days, but it was “still far short of what we would like”. He stressed that the Home Office was responsible for checking if hosts have criminal records before a visa is granted. He added: “There is no check on accommodation before that, no local police check, and no local knowledge applied to people.” A government spokesperson said: “Homes for Ukraine has stringent safeguarding measures, and they are working. All potential sponsors and adults living in the household are subject to security checks, including criminal records, before visas are approved to allow applicants to travel to the UK. Councils also conduct further checks on the sponsor and their household as quickly as possible once a visa application has been submitted. “Local authorities will provide emergency accommodation to Ukrainians if necessary. This has not been required for the overwhelming majority of the 19,500 people who have arrived under the scheme so far.” As yet there is no system in place for universities to sponsor Ukrainian refugees. However, Universities UK, the vice-chancellors’ group, said 20 universities have expressed interest. Prof David Green, vice-chancellor of Worcester University, said: “We registered our accommodation on the Homes for Ukraine website in March. Sadly, we have no refugees with us, which is so frustrating. We remain extremely keen to do this and rooms could be made available immediately.” He said with many of the refugees being women and children, it was important they could offer 24-7 security, including police community support officers embedded at the university, as well as cooking and social facilities. He added: “We want to make every contribution, however small, to help those who have been made into refugees by this cruel, illegal invasion, as well as to those who are bravely remaining to fight.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"European unity on Ukraine growing more difficult, says Estonian PM",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/06/european-unity-on-ukraine-growing-more-difficult-says-estonian-pm,2022-06-06T12:37:09Z,"Kaja Kallas warns pain of sanctions will test relations, and also criticises Macron’s stance on Putin ","European unity over the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is proving difficult to maintain in the face of the war’s impact on inflation and living standards across the continent, Estonia’s prime minister has said. Kaja Kallas also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for trying to provide Vladimir Putin with a diplomatic way out of the conflict, saying the only effect was to give the Russian leader the belief that he will not be isolated or face justice for his army’s war crimes. “We are at a point when sanctions start to hurt our side,” said Kallas, who has gained a growing reputation for standing up to Putin. “At first the sanctions were only difficult for Russia but now we are coming to a point when the sanctions are painful for our own countries, and now the question is how much pain are we willing to endure. It is different for different countries. The unity is very hard to keep. It is getting more and more difficult because of high inflation, and energy prices.” She added: “Gas might be expensive, but freedom is priceless. People living in the free world do not really understand that.” She said that as a teenager she had been liberated from a Russian totalitarian prison – Estonia was annexed by the USSR until 1991. “I know what it feels like and this is the experience of central and eastern countries,” she said. “But this is an experience that some western European countries do not have, so the values might go out of the window as soon as you feel the pain on your side.” Estonia has the highest inflation in the EU, and Kallas’s coalition government collapsed last Friday leading her to scramble to form a new government in alliance with social democrats. Kallas criticised Macron for talking to Putin, whom she accused of committing war crimes. She said: “I do not see any point in talking to him if we want to get the message through that he is isolated and the message that he will not escape unpunished for this and will be held accountable for all the crimes committed,” she said. “I am very worried by the premature calls for a ceasefire or peace, since a ceasefire does not mean the atrocities will end in the occupied territories. We have already made this mistake three times, in Georgia, Donbas and Crimea, and we cannot make this mistake again.” She said by the end of the Soviet occupation of Estonia the proportion of Russians in the population had risen from 2% to 30%, and she feared the same fate in Russian-occupied Ukraine. Macron recently repeated his view that Putin must not be humiliated, underlining the divisions between those who say Putin must be defeated and be seen to be defeated, and those who say simply he must not win. Kallas said: “Putin can well save his face by going back to Russia because his forces are in a sovereign country.” Kallas, in London to see Boris Johnson and other UK ministers, said that if her plans to form a new coalition failed, her government was likely to be replaced by another coalition that includes rightwing extremists who sympathise with Russia, oppose Ukrainian refugees and still do not recognise that Joe Biden was elected as US president legitimately. Kallas felt forced to collapse her coalition with the Centre party last Friday after weeks of rows over preschool education and welfare benefits, leaving the Centre party to look for allies on the far right to try to form a majority government. She said the far right in Estonia “use the same speaking points as Vladimir Putin, opposing Ukrainian refugees and claiming this is all war hysteria”. She said the far right had never recognised Biden’s election because they were supporters of Donald Trump. The Centre party is trying to form a government in conjunction with the small centre-right Isamaa party and the far-right EKRE Conservative People’s party of Estonia, reproducing a coalition that was in office from April 2019 to January 2021.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scotland focused on getting job done against neutrals favourites’ Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/may/31/scotland-focused-on-getting-job-done-against-neutrals-favourites-ukraine,2022-05-31T21:30:38Z,Steve Clarke brushed aside suggestions that his side would be seen as the bad guys in the World Cup playoff semi-final,"Steve Clarke is unaware of ill will towards Scotland as they prepare to host Ukraine. It is just that the backdrop to arguably Scotland’s biggest game in a generation is so unusual that it triggers abnormal discussion. Clarke’s role is to ensure his players can fix eyes on a potential World Cup berth rather than circumstances surrounding Ukraine before this playoff semi-final. Neutral support will sit with the visitors to Hampden Park but Scottish messaging appears perfectly clear. “We have to focus on the football match and I don’t think the Ukrainian team would want it any other way,” said Scotland’s manager. “Their coach has said they are ready for the game. We are ready for the game. It’s a game of football and hopefully the better team wins. Hopefully we’ll be the better team. “It’s definitely not back to normal [in Ukraine]. But we always said we would be guided by the Ukrainians and how they felt about the situation and what they wanted from the situation. What they want is that their football team can come out of the country, prepare properly as they have for the last four weeks and be ready for a football match. “They want to give their country a lift, which is absolutely 100% understandable. But we want to go to the World Cup as well. We want to give our country a lift. It’s very difficult to do but you have to separate the situation that the Ukrainians find themselves in and the context of a football match. It’s a football match and that’s what we focus on.” In the stands, if not on the pitch, the scene promises to be different from what would ordinarily be expected for a game of this magnitude. “We will respect the Ukrainian national anthem and we will applaud the Ukrainian national anthem,” said Clarke. “Then from there the fans have to sing their hearts out, get behind the team and drive the team on.” Pressed on whether Scotland could unwittingly be the bad guys of this situation, by ending Ukraine’s World Cup dream, Clarke said: “I don’t always read a lot of media but I haven’t really felt that as a narrative, that we are at fault somehow. I’ve never felt that.” Goalkeeper Craig Gordon, who will win his 67th cap, insisted it will not be overly problematic for Scotland to avoid distraction. “Because that’s what we’re trained to do,” said the 39-year-old. “We can’t even imagine what’s going on in Ukraine. We have no clue really. We can’t understand exactly what all these players are going through, what each individual’s circumstances are. What we have to do is concentrate on football, be ready and make sure we are as prepared as we can be to try to win the match.” Clarke brushed aside social media noise directed towards his captain, Andy Robertson, who was pictured with beer in hand during Liverpool’s end-of-season parade on Sunday. The left-back joined the Scotland camp a day later. “He has joined us in a great place and that’s all I am concerned about,” Clarke said. “I don’t care about criticism. It won’t bother Andy and it certainly won’t bother me. “Liverpool had a great season, when you look at two of the four major trophies in the cabinet, missed out on the league by a point and one goal did them in the Champions League final. They should have been in front before they conceded that goal. They were very close to the quadruple, they’ve had a great season. “Finishing with two disappointments is something you learn to deal with as a professional player. It’s not as if he is going to a poor Nations League end-of-season game with Scotland. It’s one of the biggest games he has probably ever faced for his country so he will be ready to go.” Clarke’s key personnel decision surrounds who to play on the left side of his back three, owing to Kieran Tierney’s injury. Liam Cooper of Leeds is likely to fill that slot. Bologna’s Aaron Hickey is expected to play at right wing-back because Everton’s Nathan Patterson has not sufficiently recovered from ankle surgery.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia takes control of Lyman as assault on Donbas region continues,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/28/russia-takes-control-lyman-ukraine-missiles-donbas-region,2022-05-28T11:43:55Z,The Russian president warned the French and German leaders it was ‘dangerous’ for the west to supply further weapons to Ukraine,"Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz held a three-way telephone conversation with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, on Saturday, with the French and German leaders urging Putin to hold “direct serious negotiations” with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy. The call came as Russia’s assault on Ukraine’s Donbas region continues to grind on. During the 80-minute conversation, the two leaders “insisted on an immediate ceasefire and a withdrawal of Russian troops”, according to a readout from Scholz’s office. Putin is unlikely to heed such calls. Instead, he warned Macron and Scholz that western weapons deliveries to Ukraine were “dangerous” and risked “further destabilisation of the situation”, according to a Kremlin readout. Hopes for diplomacy have faded in recent weeks as Russia’s invasion reaches the three-month mark. Although Ukraine is taking heavy losses on the battlefield, there is a widespread belief in the country that agreeing to a negotiated settlement would simply give Russia time to regroup ahead of a further attack. Russia’s army confirmed on Saturday that it now controls the strategic town of Lyman in eastern Ukraine, as Moscow’s assault on the Donbas region continues to grind on. Lyman, a town of 20,000 people, lies on the road to Sloviansk and Kramatorsk, two of the major Donbas population centres not yet under Russian control. “The town of Krasny Liman has been entirely liberated from Ukrainian nationalists,” said Russia’s defence ministry in a statement, using the town’s old name. Ukraine is on the back foot in Donbas, the industrial heartland of the country where Russia-backed forces already seized territory eight years ago and which has now become the centre of Moscow’s Ukraine invasion after the failed attempts to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv. In his daily video address on Friday evening, Zelenskiy, said the Russians had “concentrated maximum artillery, maximum reserves in Donbas”, making life very difficult for the Ukrainian army. “There are missile strikes and aircraft attacks – everything,” Zelenskiy said. Attention this week has been focused on the city of Sievierodonetsk, which if captured would give Russia control of the whole Luhansk region. The city has been under intense artillery and missile bombardment all week, and the Russians have taken control of the Myr hotel on the edge of town. On Saturday morning, the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Haidai, said the Russians had so far not been able to advance any further than the hotel. “We have not yet been able to get them out of there, despite their losses. But they are not able to move further either. Their tactics are always the same: a few hours of shelling, and then they try to advance,” he wrote. Ukraine’s defence minister said foreign military deliveries were helping Ukrainian forces on the frontline, noting three systems that were now in active use against the Russians: M777 and FH70 howitzers as well as the Caesar self-propelled artillery. He also said American M109 howitzer systems had arrived in Ukraine. “To imagine this back in March would have been impossible. But today it is a reality,” Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Facebook. At the same time, Ukrainian officials continue to demand more weapons deliveries from the west, saying they risk being outgunned in Donbas and need the deliveries urgently. There were reports in Washington that the Pentagon may be preparing to send Ukraine advanced long-range rocket systems to help their battle in the Donbas, something that the Ukrainian army and political leaders have been requesting for months. Meanwhile, Russian forces also carried out a demonstrative test of a new hypersonic missile on Saturday. The Zircon missile, which was first tested in late 2020, was fired from a frigate in the Barents Sea and hit a target in the White Sea in the Arctic that was 625 miles away, said Russia’s defence ministry. The Zircon can reach speeds of up to 10-times the speed of sound and flies at a low altitude, making it more difficult to intercept. Also on Saturday, Ukraine’s former president Petro Poroshenko said he was barred from leaving the country, accusing Zelenskiy of breaking a “political ceasefire” in place since the start of the war. Poroshenko was due to travel to a Nato parliamentary assembly meeting in Vilnius. Zelenskiy defeated Poroshenko in a 2019 election and before the start of the war prosecutors were investigating Poroshenko over his participation in an allegedly corrupt coal export scheme. Many observers suggested the charges were politically motivated. After the outbreak of the war, Ukrainian authorities suspended the activities of a number of political parties with pro-Russian platforms, but others were allowed to continue, including Poroshenko’s European Solidarity party. Despite the longstanding acrimony between Zelenskiy and Poroshenko, both appeared to put their quarrels aside to focus on the threat from Russia. “There is a risk that by this decision, the authorities have broken the ‘political ceasefire’ in place during the war … which one of the pillars of national unity in the face of Russian aggression,” said Poroshenko’s office in a statement.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukraine repels Russia’s attempt to cross Donbas river, and drives invaders away from Kharkiv ",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/13/ukraine-has-repelled-russias-attempt-to-cross-donbas-river-uk-confirms,2022-05-14T04:26:56Z,"Russia incurred heavy losses during Siverskyi Donets operation, according to UK MoD, and Ukraine also claimed success around Kharkiv","Ukrainians have repelled multiple attempts by the Russians to cross a strategically significant river in the Donbas, inflicting heavy losses in the process, according to local officials and British intelligence. Ukrainian forces have also driven Russia from the second-largest city of Kharkiv in their fastest advance since Kremlin troops pulled away from Kyiv and the north-east over a month ago to focus their offensive on the Donbas. The city, which had been under fierce bombardment, has been quiet for at least two weeks and Ukraine now controls territory stretching to the Siverskyi Donets river, around 40 km (25 miles) to the east. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of the Luhansk region, said Russian forces had been repulsed three times as they tried to cross the river, losing armour and bridging equipment. “We have eliminated Russian speedboats and helicopters which they used to cover their attempts,” the governor added, while aerial photography showed destroyed pontoon bridges and armour by the riverbanks. Earlier on Friday, British defence intelligence said Russia had lost “significant armoured manoeuvre elements” from a battalion tactical group – a formation with about 800 personnel at full strength – from the failed efforts. Russian attempts to gain territory in the Donbas are increasingly focused on Severodonetsk, the easternmost town held by Ukrainian forces – and the Russian forces were trying to cross the river in an attempt to cut off the town. Ukraine’s defence ministry tweeted pictures of a smashed pontoon bridge and destroyed armoured vehicles in Bilohorivka on Wednesday, describing them as showing victims of “artillerymen of the 17th tank brigade”. The British assessment appeared to verify that, and quantify the level of loss – effectively the equipment strength of one battalion of up to 90 Russian units operating in and near Ukraine. Another open source analyst estimated 73 Russian pieces of equipment, including tanks and armoured vehicles, were destroyed, relying on aerial photography of the aftermath of the battle. “Conducting river crossings in a contested environment is a highly risky manoeuvre and speaks to the pressure the Russian commanders are under to make progress in their operations in eastern Ukraine,” the British Ministry of Defence said on Friday morning. Russian forces in the Donbas have made incremental progress on the north side of the Siverskyi Donets, and are assessed to be in control of Rubizhne to the north-west of Severodonetsk by the Institute for the Study of War. Winning control of the town has taken Russian forces “two to three weeks”, western officials added, representing an incremental pace of advance by Moscow. “Russian doctrine in this kind of conflict would have its forces moving at some 40km a day,” an official added. Nevertheless, despite suggestions by US intelligence officials earlier this week that the conflict had largely ground to a standstill, other observers still believe Severodonetsk is at risk, in what is set to be a crucial battle in the struggle for control of the Donbas. “They will likely launch a ground offensive on or around Severodonetsk in the coming days,” the Institute for the Study of War said, but added it was “unclear if Russian forces can encircle, let alone capture” Severodonetsk, as the impetus in the Russian effort in the Donbas region appeared generally to have faded. A Russian offensive further west, south of Izium, had stalled for several weeks and was appearing to lose momentum, the institute added. Izium is one of the few places where Russia had managed to cross the Siverskyi Donets, but its forces have been unable to advance from there. Western officials say they believe Russia will form a defensive line behind the river, partly to protect its supply lines to forces trying to make headway further south. “This a staged and gradual withdrawal from Kharkiv,” one said, which would allow the Russian invaders to “replenish and circulate their forces”. Elsewhere, Ukraine claimed it had damaged a Russian navy logistics ship near Snake Island in the Black Sea – which is still being fought over. Satellite imagery provided by Maxar, a private US-based company, showed the aftermath of what it said were probable missile attacks on a Russian Serna-class landing craft near the island, close to Ukraine’s sea border with Romania. Renewed fighting around Snake Island in recent days may become a battle for control of the western Black Sea coast. Russia wants to maintain air defences on the island to protect its maritime operations – while for Ukraine the struggle has become symbolic, western officials added. Olaf Scholz, the German chancellor, spoke to the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, for the first time since the start of the war, urging Moscow to reach a ceasefire agreement and raising concern about international food supplies that have been disrupted by the fighting, according to Berlin’s account of the 75-minute call. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, warned the French leader, Emmanuel Macron, was trying “in vain” to have a constructive dialogue with Putin, in an interview with Italian television – suggesting there was little appetite in Kyiv for a cessation of fighting at the moment. “We must not look for a way out for Russia,” Zelenskiy said – although the Élysée Palace said Macron had “never discussed anything with Vladimir Putin without the agreement of President Zelenskiy”.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Up to 100 Ukraine troops could be dying in Donbas each day, says Zelenskiy",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/up-to-100-ukraine-troops-could-be-dying-donbas-each-day-zelenskiy,2022-05-23T14:14:12Z,"President gives insight into country’s casualties, as Luhansk governor says Russia using ‘scorched-earth’ tactics","Ukraine’s president has given an insight into the level of losses being suffered by Ukrainian forces in the Donbas, saying between 50 to 100 Ukrainians could be dying every day. While Ukraine and its allies have made much of Russian losses since the war began, the issue of Ukrainian casualties has been something of a black hole. The heaviest fighting is focused around the twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk in Luhansk, one of the two provinces that make up the Donbas. “Today, from 50 to 100 people could be killed here in the most complicated area, in the east of our country,” Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday evening. Serhiy Haidai, the governor of Luhansk, said in a local television interview that Russia was using “scorched-earth” tactics in the region and that Severodonetsk had been attacked from “four separate directions”, though Russian forces had not succeeded in breaking into the city. The Donbas has been the scene of recent heavy fighting involving intense shelling by both sides, with Zelenskiy’s remarks appearing to be a reference to fatalities in combat. The high recent death toll on the Ukrainian side also suggests an even larger number of non-fatal casualties. Historically a ratio of one killed in action to three wounded was regarded as a rough rule of thumb for assessing casualties, although better field medical treatment and evacuation, not least for US forces in theatres such as Afghanistan and Iraq, resulted in a far higher survival rate from injuries that would once have caused deaths. According to a policy briefing paper published by the Belfer Center in 2014: “The ratio of wounded to killed in battle has increased dramatically as a result of improvements in medical care in conflict zones. This shift is particularly relevant for technologically advanced countries such as the United States, which invest significant resources in military medicine.” The new estimate came as Kyiv also revealed its worst military losses from a single attack of the Ukraine war on Monday, saying 87 people had been killed last week when Russian forces struck a barracks housing troops at a training base in the north. The disclosure that scores had been killed in the attack demonstrated Russia’s ability to inflict huge losses, even far from the front. Previously, Kyiv had said eight people died in the 17 May strike on the barracks in the town of Desna. “Today we completed work at Desna. In Desna, under the rubble, there were 87 casualties. Eighty-seven corpses,” Zelenskiy said during a speech made by video link to business leaders in Davos, Switzerland. Moscow had said at the time that it hit a training base with long-range missiles. The toll Zelenskiy announced on Monday was more than double the number killed in a similar attack on a Ukrainian training base in Yaraviv in the west in March. The updated death toll from Desna emerged following recent remarks by senior Ukrainian officials, including the president, that warned of increasing bloodshed in the next phase of the conflict, amid anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive later in the summer. Zelenskiy’s acknowledgment of the increasingly heavy toll on Ukraine’s military follows claims by the UK’s Ministry of Defence that since Russia invaded Ukraine, it has probably suffered a similar death toll to that experienced by the Soviet Union during its nine-year war in Afghanistan, although those claims could not be independently verified. Like Ukraine, western allies including the UK have tended to emphasise Russian losses while avoiding the issue of Ukrainian losses as part of the information war with Moscow that appears in part aimed at trying to shift Russian public opinion against Putin’s invasion. A combination of “poor low-level tactics, limited air cover, a lack of flexibility” and a command approach that is “prepared to reinforce failure and repeat mistakes” has led to the high Russian casualty rate, British intelligence said in its latest report released on Monday morning. Casualties are continuing to rise in the Donbas offensive, the report added. “The Russian public has, in the past, proven sensitive to casualties suffered during wars of choice. As casualties suffered in Ukraine continue to rise they will become more apparent, and public dissatisfaction with the war and a willingness to voice it may grow.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Leonid Kravchuk, first president of Ukraine, dies aged 88",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/leonid-kravchuk-first-president-of-ukraine-dies-aged-88,2022-05-10T20:49:29Z,"Former leader relinquished his country’s Soviet nuclear arsenal, the third-largest in the world","Ukraine’s first president Leonid Kravchuk, who agreed to give up his country’s Soviet nuclear arsenal, the third-largest in the world, has died at the age of 88. “Sad news and a great loss,” presidential aide Andriy Yermak said on Telegram, describing Kravchuk as “a wise patriot of Ukraine, a truly historical figure in gaining our independence”. Kravchuk led Ukraine as its Communist party boss in the waning years of the Soviet Union, and played a pivotal role in the demise of the USSR before holding the Ukrainian presidency from 1991 through 1994. He was a driving force in Ukraine’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 and later that year joined leaders of Russia and Belarus to sign an agreement on 8 December 1991, which formally declared that the Soviet Union ceased to exist. As president, Kravchuk agreed to transfer remaining Soviet nuclear weapons on Ukrainian territory to Russian control, in a deal backed by the US. He lost the 1994 presidential election to former prime minister Leonid Kuchma. In 2020 he returned to politics to try to negotiate a settlement as part of a “contact group” for the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Russia-backed separatists had fought Ukrainian forces since 2014. Kravchuk had been in poor health and underwent a heart operation last year. Ukrainian Defence minister Oleksii Reznikov wrote on Twitter that with Kravchuk’s signature to the 1991 agreement disbanding the Soviet Union “the Evil Empire disintegrated”. “Thank you for the peaceful renewal of our Independence. We’re defending it now with weapons in our hands,” Reznikov wrote Tuesday. In a post on Telegram, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko paid tribute to Kravchuk, who served as president from 1991 to 1994, hailing him for his “talent, a strong character and knowledge”. Kravchuk’s death comes a week after that of the first president of post-Soviet Belarus, Stanislav Shushkevich, who died aged 87 after treatment for Covid-19, according to his wife. After Shushkevich’s death, Kravchuk was the last survivor of the three leaders who signed the 1991 deal. Russian president Boris Yeltsin died in 2007 aged 76. Since annexing Crimea from Ukraine and throwing its weight behind the 2014 separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine, the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has sought to cast doubt on Ukraine’s statehood and falsely portray the country as an artificial construct of Communist rule – rhetoric that paved the way for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. In a televised address on 21 February , three days before the invasion, Putin blamed “historic, strategic mistakes” by Communist leaders for having led to the collapse of the Soviet state. Ukraine “turned to us for financial support many times from the very moment they declared independence”, Putin said in an apparent reference to Kravchuk’s time in office. Some participants in the historic 8 December meeting at a hunting lodge in the Belovezha forest, in what is now Belarus, pointed to Kravchuk as having played the main role in the demise of the Soviet Union. Ukraine had declared its sovereignty after an August coup by hardline Communist party members weakened Soviet president, Mikhail Gorbachev’s authority. A week before the Belovezha agreement, Kravchuk was elected president of Ukraine in a vote that also overwhelmingly approved its independence from Moscow. Participants in the Belovezha talks said Kravchuk rejected any efforts to keep the Soviet Union going with reforms. “Kravchuk was focused on Ukraine’s independence,” Belarusian leader Shushkevich, who took part in the talks and signed the deal, told The Associated Press in an interview last year. “He was proud that Ukraine declared its independence in a referendum and he was elected president on 1 December, 1991.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Ukrainian refugee families could get host who failed DBS check, says council",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/11/ukrainian-refugee-families-could-get-host-who-failed-dbs-check-says-council,2022-05-12T06:47:15Z,"Homes for Ukraine scheme’s problems continue, as council warns of potential issue with parallel processes","Ukrainian families could potentially be housed with a host who has failed a DBS check, a council has warned, as the government’s Homes for Ukraine scheme continues to face a range of problems. A DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) check allows employers or other bodies to check the criminal record of someone applying for a role. William Benson, chief executive of Tunbridge Wells borough council, said that if a host failed a DBS check, or their home was deemed unsuitable for the scheme, they would not necessarily be prevented from hosting a Ukrainian refugee as these two processes “run parallel to each other”. He added that refugees were matched to hosts before the DBS check process began. Benson said: “One of the big outstanding issues is that we do not yet know what we do if a host fails a DBS, or a house check. So under what power do we remove someone who has had a pretty traumatic experience coming over here? “There is a potential that a guest is on their way, or has arrived, to be hosted in a house that we don’t believe is suitable.” After a Ukrainian refugee is matched with a host, Kent county council performs the DBS check and Tunbridge Wells borough council performs the check to see whether the house is suitable. But, according to Benson, because they are “separate processes, it is entirely possible that the guests could have had their visa approved and have arrived in a home that we don’t believe is suitable”. Benson has called for more guidance from central government on what to do in such potential cases. Kent county council has also expressed concern regarding the lack of provision made for people coming to the UK through the Ukraine family scheme, which allows applicants to join immediate family members based in the UK, rather than through Homes for Ukraine. “We still retain concern about the operation of the family scheme,” said Roger Gough, the leader of Kent county council. “On one side, regarding the Homes for Ukraine scheme, there is clarity of how it should work, and there is government funding. On the side of those coming via the family route, there is nothing. “And equally, it is also not clear what happens if those relationships break down and people come into the system needing rematching.” According to Gough, there have been instances of family breakdowns and of Ukrainians coming to the UK through the families scheme and later presenting to the council as homeless. In one particular case, a person who occupied a room in a shared house signed up to host four people under the family scheme, who then had to be rehoused due to the unsuitability of the accommodation. Kent has seen about 7,000 households register interest in becoming a host under the Homes for Ukraine scheme and, of these, 1,104 have been matched with Ukrainian refugees so far. The Homes for Ukraine scheme has faced many problems since its launch. Most recently the government had to rehouse hundreds of Ukrainians granted visas because the people they were supposed to stay with had been deemed “unsuitable”. A government spokesperson said: “More than 37,400 people have arrived through both Ukraine schemes and the vast majority of these are settling in well. Very few sponsorships are breaking down. Where they do, councils are able to provide support or find a more suitable sponsor.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The convoy arrived in the south-eastern city of Zaporizhzhia after dark, carrying about 170 evacuees. There were 51 civilians who had been sheltering in the Azovstal complex, and about 120 others who had walked or hitched lifts across the city to a pickup point in a ruined shopping mall. The journey of just over 200 kilometres took two days, as the convoy of buses was held for hours at Russian checkpoints and the hungry, weary residents inside interrogated. “I didn’t think we would make it out alive, so I don’t have any plans for my future,” said Natalia, who worked at the Azovstal plant all her adult life and then sheltered for over two months in its network of bunkers. She had fled with little more than a collection of drawings made by children in their shelter; she had organised drawing competitions to occupy them and kept the pictures to remember. “I wouldn’t have given them up even if they shot me.” Ukraine’s Deputy prime minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on Saturday that “all women, children and elderly” had come out of the complex and were being evacuated. About 36 hours later the group filed slowly off the buses into the late evening dark, and fell upon a hot meal prepared in the registration tent. It also had clothes and toys, as most people fled with just a couple of bags. “It is a breath of fresh air to be on Ukrainian-held land,” said Tatiana, who fled with her daughter and granddaughter. Many children and elderly people were among the exhausted-looking arrivals. “I just want to live and start again … everything I have is here,” said Yegor Chekhonadsky, pointing to a cluster of bags at his feet. He, his wife and two sons had sheltered at Azovstal since early March. “Of course I’m overjoyed, and happy to be in Ukraine.” Mariupol has endured the most destructive fighting of the 10-week-old war. The plant is the last part of the city – a strategic southern port on the Azov Sea – still in the hands of Ukrainian fighters. Scores of civilians were trapped for weeks alongside them in the plant with little food, water or medicine. Pascal Hundt, the head of delegation for the ICRC in Ukraine said the group “have all endured a level of horror no human should have to go through.” The operation began on 5 May, the third safe passage coordinated in recent days, but around 2000 soldiers – many of them injured – are thought to remain trapped. Earlier on Sunday, the remaining Ukrainian fighters at the plant vowed to continue their stand as long as they are alive. “We don’t have much time,” Captain Sviatoslav Palamar told an online news conference, pleading with the international community to help evacuate wounded soldiers.

"Ukrainian man drives 3,700km to be reunited with parents and fiancee – who live just 10km away",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/22/ukrainian-man-drives-3700km-to-be-reunited-with-parents-and-fiancee-who-live-just-10km-away,2022-05-22T07:00:43Z,"Only a 10-minute drive apart but cut off by war, Serhi Belyaev took a perilous road trip to be with his loved ones again","It is a 10-minute drive from Serhi Belyaev’s house in the village of Tsyrkuny to his fiancee’s home in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second city. A quick spin west on Soborna Street, over the E40 motorway on to the Lesia Serduika highway, and you are there. That was, until the war came. It took just hours for Russian forces to sweep into Belyaev’s village on 24 February, as they advanced on Kharkiv, the closest major Ukrainian city to the Russian border. Lives across Ukraine were changed that morning. For Belyaev, the frontline of the largest conflict in Europe since the second world war now lay between him and both his girlfriend, Nataliy Drozd, 28, and his parents. No longer the familiar road into town, Lesia Serduika was now an impassable no man’s land. Belyaev was cut off, worried for his sick mother, Galina, 66, and determined to be with his terrified girlfriend. Then Belyaev, 32, a professional poker player, had an idea. A gamble. He mused on it, initially rejected it and then settled on it. He would replace the 10km drive with a 3,700km odyssey. “To the Russian border, through Russia to Latvia, on to Lithuania and Poland and then back into western Ukraine to come at Kharkiv from the west,” he says. “It was a bit crazy, yes.” But it was possible. What followed was an extraordinary adventure that brought Belyaev to the attention of the Kremlin’s secret police, the FSB, who rightly suspected him of giving away Russian positions to the Ukrainian army. He traversed cities under fire, driving in against the flow of refugees, and there were, he admits, moments of doubt. “But only briefly: I had to get to my fiancee.” In the first days of the war, Belyaev and his brother Yuri, 45, fled Tsyrkuny, which was in flames, for Strilecha, a village a short way north that was occupied but not under fire. Belyaev started talking to families who wanted to get to Poland. He decided he would join a convoy of four cars in his black Honda Accord. “The car needed repairs to the brakes and the transmission,” he recalls. “It made terrible noises, but there was no other option.” Yuri, who has a heart condition, chose to stay behind to look after their dog. His place in the car was taken by two strangers: Emil, 28, and Emil’s fiancee, Katya, 22. On 4 April at 1pm they set off. It was a jittery start. “We had been told by Russian soldiers the border, a kilometre away, would be open. But it wasn’t,” Belyaev recalls. The only viable option was to drive 70km through occupied land to a second border crossing. “That 70km was the hardest,” says Belyaev. “There were lots of checkpoints and, halfway there, we came to some Russian soldiers who wouldn’t let us through.” The convoy was turned round. They were directed by the soldiers towards what they would soon discover was a filtration camp in a local administrative building. Their lives were on the line. “We were all interrogated. They were very suspicious of Emil, who was from Luhansk in the east and didn’t have a passport as it had been burned at the start of the war. His phone was also broken because of the humidity in the cellar where he had hidden from the bombardments.” Emil was undressed to his underwear so they could search for tattoos that might offer evidence of a military affiliation. Then they went through Belyaev’s phone. “I had deleted everything,” he says. “If I hadn’t, I would be dead. I didn’t sit with my hands in my pockets when the war began. I sent locations of Russian military convoys to friends in the territorial defence.” But the group were finally handed the documents they needed at 4pm on the first day of the journey. A 5pm Russian curfew was looming. Those breaking it were liable to be shot. Belyaev put his foot down, unsure whether he was on the right road as there was no data coverage, no road signs and they were on dirt tracks. “We had to cross a bridge at the village of Rubizhne. I saw it being built when I was 10 when my brother took me fishing,” Belyaev says. Now it was in ruins. “I saw its birth and I saw its death,” he adds. There was just one lane still standing. “It wouldn’t take much weight,” Belyaev says. “I was terrified at that point. It was a 20-metre drop to the river below.” But they made it – and at the next checkpoint, the convoy of cars was waved through. The mood of the group lifted. But disaster struck. One of the drivers had got overexcited. “He was driving a bit faster – and he hit a pot hole hard.” The car’s front wheels were badly damaged and there was no way it could complete the journey. They drove to the closest city, Vovchansk, with a heavy heart. “But again pure luck,” says Belyaev. “The first person I asked about where a garage might be said he was a mechanic. He repaired the car so quickly that we could get going immediately.” It was now 7pm and the border was due to close at 8pm. But the mechanic was confident they would get through. “We went but there was no electricity, so it was pitch black,” Belyaev recalls. “I was the lead car. Then, out of nowhere, right in front of me, was a soldier with a machine gun. We were at the border.” It took five hours to get across after a thorough questioning. “And then we decided to turn right – I don’t know why because it was the wrong way,” says Belyaev. The soldiers blinked the lights on their military vehicles. They had their machine guns out and were now suspicious and aggressive. “We explained that we didn’t know the way.” The soldiers conferred. “But they accepted it and waved us on.” As the convoy went on its way, Emil joked, “What do we need to do to get shot?” But now, at 3am on the second day, they were in Putin’s Russia. “I sent a text to Nataliy telling her where I was, just saying that it was safer there,” says Belyaev. “She was actually angry because I had left the dog behind. I didn’t tell her about my plan to come back in. I was worried my communications would be intercepted.” The convoy drove on, heading to Belgorod, the closest big Russian city. Almost immediately they were waved down again. It was the FSB, the successor to the Soviet KGB. “Every single one of us was interrogated again,” says Belyaev. “But I knew my phone was clean. They asked me about my job. We must have spent 20 minutes talking about poker.” They reached Belgorod around 5am, where they slept in their cars outside a supermarket. “But this was enemy territory. We knew we had to sleep less and drive more.” They were up again two hours later. Belyaev played music on his phone. The soundtrack, Belyaev laughs, was Gwen Stefani, Jay-Z and Limp Bizkit. Their trip then took them through Kursk, Roslavl, Smolensk and Velikiye Luki, where they arrived at 5am on the second day, to snatch some sleep. Exhausted, they finally reached the Ubylinka border crossing into Latvia at 10am the following day, 6 April. It took 16 hours to get through border control. “But it was such a relief,” recalls Belyaev. “I felt I was a man with rights again. I called Nataliy and my parents and told her about my real plans. Nataliy said, ‘You have a chance to stay in safety. You should stay there because men between 18 and 60 aren’t allowed to leave Ukraine. We can be together when the war ends’.” Belyaev had no time to think. It was 2am and they were facing a 1,000km journey to Poland via Latvia. At midday they stopped at Kaunas in southern Lithuania. “This was the first wifi – in McDonald’s. I called my friends and parents. ‘I am eating McDonald’s. How about you?’,” he laughs. The convoy headed off again, this time to Warsaw, arriving at 7pm. His fellow travellers had reached their destination: a large expo hall turned into a refugee centre. Belyaev had to make a decision. He pondered during a seven-day stay in Warsaw. The risks seemed grave. He was also sick with Covid symptoms and getting worse. But he felt he had to go on. “I told Nataliy that I wanted to come back. I said, ‘Wait for me, baby’.” On 14 April, at 2pm, Belyaev left Warsaw for the Rava-Ruska border, joining a humanitarian convoy. They reached Lviv, Ukraine’s most westerly city, at midnight, loaded up some supplies, and set off. This was wartime Ukraine: every road posed a risk. “A lot of roads were closed – it added probably 100km to our 550km journey. But it is nothing when you are driving 3,700km rather than 10km to get home,” laughs Belyaev. He reached Kyiv at noon on 15 April and slept at a friend’s – in a bed for the first time in 11 days. On the morning of 18 April, he left Kyiv for Poltava, a city halfway to his destination, where his younger brother lived. “It was the first time I had driven alone,” says Belyaev. “I found it hard.” In Poltava, he picked up medicines for his parents and he was now en route to the very frontline of the war in Ukraine, where his village remained cut off and the battle of Kharkiv raged. But Belyaev had no doubts. It was perhaps even time for a little surprise. “I rang my dad and told him a volunteer was near with supplies, so he should come down,” Belyaev smiles. “And he found me.” The men hugged. With his mum, tears flowed. Then, just 50 metres from Nataliy’s house, he was stopped by police. “They were suspicious of the blankets and the state of my car. They asked if I had been sleeping in it, and why. It was only my passport stamps that persuaded them of my story.” Finally he was, however, back with the woman he loved. Had Belyaev made the right decision to head back? Nataliy smiles: “Home is home.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Pulitzer prize for Ukraine journalists rewards courageous, truthful reporting",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/10/pulitzer-prize-for-ukraine-journalists-rewards-courageous-truthful-reporting,2022-05-10T00:18:36Z,Special citation comes as at least seven journalists have died since Russian invasion,"The Pulitzer prizes have honoured the journalists of Ukraine with a special citation hailing the country’s reporters for the “courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting” that they have shown since the Russian invasion. “The Pulitzer prize board is pleased to award a special citation to the journalists of Ukraine for their courage, endurance and commitment to truthful reporting during Vladimir Putin’s ruthless invasion of their country and his propaganda war in Russia,” said prize administrator Marjorie Miller. The Pulitzer board wrote: “Despite bombardment, abductions, occupation, and even deaths in their ranks, they have persisted in their effort to provide an accurate picture of a terrible reality, doing honour to Ukraine and to journalists around the world.” At least seven journalists, including three from Ukraine, have been killed since Russian forces invaded on 24 February, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Among them was Vira Hyrych, a reporter for Radio Liberty who died after a Russian missile hit her Kyiv apartment building on 29 April. On 4 May, Oleksandr Makhov, a Ukrainian television reporter who joined the country’s armed forces, was killed while fighting Russian forces in the north-eastern city of Izyum, according to Reuters. In 2021, the Pulitzers granted their special citation to reporters in Afghanistan who reported on the impact that years of war were having on the country and its residents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russians advance into largest city in Donbas still in Ukrainian hands,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/russians-advance-largest-city-donbas-ukrainian-hands-sievierodonetsk,2022-05-30T16:28:22Z,Witnesses say tanks moving into Sievierodonetsk amid intense shelling and civilian casualties,"Russian tanks and troops have begun advancing into Sievierodonetsk, the largest city in Donbas still held by Ukraine, bringing fighting street by street as the Kremlin’s forces continue to grind forwards in the east of the country. Witnesses said Russian tanks were advancing towards the centre of the city one blast at a time, razing everything in their path that remains after intense shelling that Ukrainian authorities have said has led to conditions on the ground reminiscent of Mariupol. “Unfortunately we have disappointing news: the enemy is moving into the city,” the Luhansk regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, told Ukrainian national television on Monday. The Russian army “use the same tactics over and over again. They shell for several hours – for three, four, five hours – in a row and then attack. Those who attack die. Then the shelling and attack follow again, and so on until they break through somewhere.” The battle for Sievierodonetsk, which lies on the eastern bank of the Siverskyi Donets River, about 90 miles south of the Russian border, is in the spotlight as Russia makes slow but solid gains in the industrial Donbas, which comprises the self-proclaimed republics in Luhansk and Donetsk. Witnesses said the city was being bombed “200 times an hour” as Russian forces try to cut off reinforcement lines and surround its remaining Ukrainian defenders. The city’s mayor, Oleksandr Striuk, confirmed in a telephone interview with the Associated Press that Russian troops had “advanced a few blocks towards the city centre”. He said Ukrainian forces were fighting to push the Russians out in street fighting and that the 12,000-13,000 civilians left in the city were sheltering in basements and bunkers to escape relentless bombardment. Local authorities estimated that 1,500 civilians had already died in Russian attacks on Sievierodonetsk, including from a lack of medicines. Striuk said the city had “been completely ruined” and that the number of victims was “rising every hour, but we are unable to count the dead and the wounded amid the street fighting”. Relentless Russian artillery barrages have destroyed critical infrastructure and damaged 90% of the buildings, and power and communications have been largely cut to a city that was once home to 100,000 people. A French journalist was killed after an armoured humanitarian evacuation vehicle in which he was travelling was hit by shrapnel from a Russian shell in Sievierodonetsk. According to local authorities, shrapnel pierced the vehicle’s armour, killing Frédéric Leclerc-Imhoff as he travelled alongside civilians forced to flee Russian bombs. The evacuation was called off after the attack. Having failed to take the national capital, Kyiv, in the early phase of the war, Russia is seeking to consolidate its grip on Donbas, large parts of which are already controlled by Moscow-backed separatists. It has concentrated huge firepower on a small area – in contrast to the earlier phase of the conflict, when its forces were often spread thinly – bludgeoning towns and cities with artillery and airstrikes. “They don’t care how many lives they will have to pay for this,” said Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his latest national address, referring to Russian forces in the region. Russia has also stepped up its efforts to take the neighbouring city of Lysychansk, where, according to Gaidai, a Russian shell fell on a residential building over the weekend, killing a child. The two cities sit on either side of the strategically important Siverskyi Donets River. According to Ukrainian officials, Lysychansk is still under Ukrainian control, while the main road into the two cities has been shelled, but not blocked. The last remaining access and evacuation route, leading south-west towards the town of Bakhmut, remains under Ukrainian control. The Ukrainian defence ministry spokesman Oleksandr Motuzyanyk said Ukrainian troops were doing all they could to prevent Russian forces from completely encircling Sievierodonetsk, which if it fell could help Moscow to consolidate its grip on the Donbas – large parts of which were controlled by Moscow-backed separatists before the 24 February invastion. “The liberation of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, recognised by the Russian Federation as independent states, is an unconditional priority,” Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, told the French TV channel TF1, adding that other Ukrainian territories should decide their future on their own. Russian forces are also regrouping to resume their offensive further west in the direction of the Sloviansk region of eastern Ukraine, Motuzyanyk said. “In Sloviansk, the enemy is regrouping to resume attacks in the direction of Izyum-Barvinkove and Izyum-Sloviansk,” he told a briefing. In the south of the country, the Russian-appointed mayor of occupied Melitopol said two civilians had been wounded by an explosion that she blamed on Ukraine. No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion, which Halyna Danylchenko denounced as a “cynical terror attack by the Kyiv regime” in remarks broadcast by Russian state television. Meanwhile, the fate of the the last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, who surrendered on 20 May, hangs by a thread. According to Yuri Sirovatko, a pro-Moscow separatist official and justice minister of the self-proclaimed Donetsk people’s republic (DNR) in eastern Ukraine, the Ukrainian fighters may face the death penalty. “The court will make a decision about them,” Sirovatko was quoted as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. “For such crimes we have the highest form of punishment in the DNR – the death penalty. “All the prisoners of war are on the territory of the DNR,” he said, adding that there were about 2,300 soldiers from Azovstal among them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Russia halts gas supplies to Finland as payments row with the west escalates,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/russia-halts-gas-supplies-to-finland-as-payments-row-with-the-west-escalates,2022-05-21T05:51:01Z,Russia cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month amid an energy payments dispute sparked by Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,"Russia has halted providing natural gas to neighbouring Finland, which has angered Moscow by applying for Nato membership, after the Nordic country refused to pay supplier Gazprom in roubles. Gazprom Export has demanded that European countries pay for Russian gas supplies in roubles because of sanctions imposed over Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, but Finland refuses to do so. “Gas imports through Imatra entry point have been stopped,” Gasgrid Finland said in a statement. Imatra is the entry point for Russian gas into Finland. Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum on Friday said Gazprom had warned that flows would be halted from 0400 GMT on Saturday morning. Gasum also confirmed on Saturday that the flows had stopped. “Natural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum’s supply contract have been cut off,” it said in a statement. “Starting from today, during the upcoming summer season, Gasum will supply natural gas to its customers from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline.” Balticconnector links Finland to neighbouring Estonia’s gas grid. Gazprom Export on Friday said flows would be cut because Gasum had not complied with the new Russian rules requiring settlement in roubles. The majority of gas used in Finland comes from Russia but gas only accounts for about 5% of its annual energy consumption. Finland, along with neighbouring Sweden, this week broke its historical military non-alignment and applied for Nato membership, after public and political support for the alliance soared following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Moscow has warned Finland that any Nato membership application would be “a grave mistake with far-reaching consequences”. Most European supply contracts are denominated in euros or dollars and Moscow already cut off gas to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to comply with the new payment terms. Gasum, the Finnish government and individual gas consuming companies in Finland have said they were prepared for a shutdown of Russian flows and that the country will manage without. “The Finnish gas system is in balance both physically and commercially,” Gasgrid said on Saturday. Finland on Friday said it had agreed to charter a storage and regasification vessel from US based Excelerate Energy to help replace Russian supplies, starting in the fourth quarter this year. The vessel turns supercooled, liquefied natural gas (LNG), which arrives on ships, back into regular gas.

UK pledges to back Sweden and Finland against Russian threats,https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/may/11/uk-pledges-to-back-sweden-and-finland-against-russian-threats-nato,2022-05-11T17:56:52Z,Johnson signs security pacts with the two countries and says assistance may include ‘military means’Russia-Ukraine war: latest updates,"Boris Johnson has promised to support Sweden and Finland against potential Russian threats in any way necessary as he travelled to both countries to sign mutual security agreements, with their governments mulling Nato membership in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. Holding a press conference with the Swedish prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, on his first stop on a daylong trip, Johnson said the type and extent of possible support would largely be governed by what Sweden might ask for. Johnson had earlier signed mutual security agreements with Andersson. Later on Wednesday he signed a parallel deal with the Finnish president, Sauli Niinistö. The mutual agreements promise that if either country faced an attack or a disaster, they would “upon request from the affected country assist each other in a variety of ways, which may include military means”. At his press conference with Niinistö at the presidential palace in Helsinki, Johnson confirmed in response to a question that this could involve UK troops in Finland or Sweden: “Yes, we will come to each other’s assistance, including with military assistance.” While the wording is general, the impetus comes from the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the subsequent decisions of Sweden and Finland to consider applying for Nato membership, and Russia’s threats of consequences if this happens. Asked at the Helsinki press conference about a potential hostile response from Russia if Finland opted to apply to join Nato, Niinistö said: “If that would be the case then my response would be: you caused this. Look in the mirror.” Speaking earlier alongside Andersson in Harpsund, the Swedish prime ministerial country retreat, Johnson said: “The war in Ukraine is forcing us all to make difficult decisions. But sovereign nations must be free to make those decisions without fear or influence or threat of retaliation.” Questioned about what the UK-Sweden agreement might mean in practical terms, Johnson remained largely vague, but did not completely demur when asked if it could go as far as the UK providing assistance with nuclear weapons. “This is about our joint decision to show that we will support and defend each other,” he said. “When it comes to our nuclear deterrent, that’s something we don’t generally comment upon, but what I’ve made clear is that it’s up to either party to make a request, and we take it very seriously.” Johnson, who dodged questions on UK plans to potentially try to escape the post-Brexit Northern Ireland protocol, and his views on the Labour leader Keir Starmer’s pledge to resign if fined for breaching lockdown rules, said the deal was “the foundation stone” for closer links. “This declaration is something that is about the UK and Sweden standing together, affirming our friendship and our partnership, and our willingness to come to each other’s defence and support,” he said. Asked about Sweden’s decision over whether to apply to join Nato, Johnson said the UK would be supportive. “That’s not for me to comment upon except, of course, to say that I’m sure the UK will support whatever course of action Sweden decides to embark upon.” • This article was amended on 11 May 2022 because an earlier version referred to Sauli Niinistö as the Finnish prime minister.

Russia ‘takes control of Azovstal steel plant’; gas supply to Finland to be cut – as it happened,https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/may/20/russia-ukraine-war-russia-has-turned-donbas-into-hell-zelenskiy-says-us-senate-approves-40bn-in-aid-for-ukraine-live,2022-05-20T23:29:04Z,Plant was last part of Mariupol in Ukrainian hands; Gazprom will suspend gas sales to Finland from Saturday. This blog is now closed,"This blog is closing now but we will be back in a few hours with more rolling updates on the war in Ukraine. In the meantime you can read all our coverage of the conflict here. Russia has taken control of the Azovstal steel plant, the country’s defence ministry said on Friday evening. Ukrainian soldiers had finally ended their defence of the site in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, Prokopenko said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the Ukrainian combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. Russian troops fired on a school in Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region, killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, the head of the Luhansk regional state administration, Serhiy Haidai, said. At least seven people, including a child, have been injured in a Russian missile attack on the town of Lozova in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The missile had targeted “the newly renovated House of Culture” in Lozova, Zelenskiy said in a statement on social media. Zelenskiy has condemned the airstrike in the Kharkiv region, describing the attack as “absolute evil, absolute stupidity”. In his nightly address, Zelenskiy appealed to allies to hold Russia financially responsible for its aggression and called for “the prosecution of all Russian war criminals”. A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken of inside the plant, writing: “Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.” G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week. Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler, Gasum, starting from Saturday. The Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he will speak to Finland tomorrow regarding its bid to join Nato and maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and that he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow. A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The United States has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions on the Kremlin. Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. – Léonie Chao-Fong, Gloria Oladipo, Pjotr Sauer, Maanvi Singh Moody’s, the ratings agency, lowered Ukraine’s debt rating again. Here’s a bit from AFP: Moody’s on Friday cut Ukraine’s debt rating for the second time in three months and lowered the outlook to negative due to the growing risk the Russian invasion will affect the nation’s debt sustainability. The ratings agency cut the grade a notch to Caa3, after lowering it two notches from B3 in early March, saying the country could face “a more protracted military conflict than Moody’s initially expected” following the invasion in late February. That “increases the likelihood of a debt restructuring and losses being imposed on private-sector creditors,” the statement said. Despite large financial support from the international community to help with immediate needs, “the resulting significant rise in government debt is likely to prove unsustainable over the medium term” and could “impede further access to official financing.” The US Congress on Thursday approved a gargantuan $40-billion aid package for Ukraine to help fight Russia and keep the government operating, after a $14-billion package in March. The International Monetary Fund in March approved a $1.4-billion aid package for the war-torn country, while the World Bank has approved a loan of $350 million as part of a total package of more than $700 million. Thousands in Latvia have rallied, calling for a Soviet-era monument to be destroyed, the AFP reports: The monument has become a rallying point in the Baltic state, to call for the World War II memorial to be destroyed. “Such monuments commemorating oppressive regimes are a form of pollution. Not for the environment but rather for heads and minds,” Girts Kalnins, who organised the demonstration, told AFP. Protesters could be seen carrying placards reading “Support Ukrainians” and “Our land, Our rules” and waved Latvian and Ukrainian flags. Local media reported around 10,000 participants. “If we finally got rid of the final remaining Soviet monuments, Latvia will finally lose that unlucky ‘post-Soviet’ name,” said Kaspars Zemitis, a jazz guitarist, before playing at the rally. A crowdfunding effort to destroy the 79-metre high monument, which was built in 1985, has raised more than 250,000 euros ($263,000). The city council has given a preliminary go-ahead for the structure to be taken down. “Over the decades, that monument has turned from a war memorial into a meeting place for those who justify Russian war crimes in Ukraine,” said Martins Krusts, an economist. Every year, thousands of ethnic Russians living in Latvia, who make up 30 percent of the population, rally at the monument on May 9 to commemorate the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. In his nightly address, Volodymyr Zelenskiy appealed to allies to hold Russia financially responsible for its aggression, and called for “the prosecution of all Russian war criminals”. He said: First of all, liberation. We must fight until we clear our land of the occupiers and guarantee Ukraine’s security. Secondly, it is the prosecution of all Russian war criminals. In the Ukrainian courts, in the international tribunal and just on the battlefield while the war continues. But, thirdly, we are working to ensure that Russia compensates in one way or another for everything it has destroyed in Ukraine. Every burned house. Every ruined school, ruined hospital. Each blown up house of culture and infrastructure facility. Every destroyed enterprise. Every shut down business, every hryvnia lost by people, enterprises, communities and the state. Pjotr Sauer and Peter Beaumont report: The last group of Ukrainian soldiers holed up in the smashed Azovstal steel works has surrendered, Russia’s defence ministry said late on Friday, marking an end to the three-month siege of the defenders’ last stronghold in Mariupol. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for prisoners of war, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. Earlier this week, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had registered “hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners of war” from the Azovstal plant and asked for immediate access to them. “In accordance with the mandate given to the ICRC by states under the 1949 Geneva conventions, the ICRC must have immediate access to all PoWs in all places where they are held,” the the Geneva-based humanitarian agency said. With its urban areas sprawling along the coastline of the Sea of Azov, the besieged city of Mariupol has become a symbol of the worst violence in Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine. It was one of the first major cities to be encircled and viewed as one of the Kremlin’s key objectives both for its economic importance and as a stepping stone in building a land bridge from Russia to Russian-occupied Crimea. The city has been subjected to weeks of punishing Russian shell fire, which has targeted health facilities, including the city’s maternity hospitals. In March, hundreds of people are believed to have been killed when the Donetsk regional drama theatre was bombed. The Russian Justice Ministry added chess champion Garry Kasparov and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky to a list of individuals acting as foreign agents, reports Reuters. According to the ministry’s website, Kasparov and Khodorkovsky were added today. Both are prominent critics of the Russian government. On the website, Ukraine was mentioned as a source of financing for Khodorkovsky, a public critic of Russia president Vladimir Putin. The website also alleged that Kasparov’s funds were sourced from Ukraine and the Human Rights Foundation. Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has condemned an airstrike today that hit a cultural center in the Kharkiv region, describing the attack as “absolute evil, absolute stupidity.” Zelenskiy posted the video of the moment a historical building in the town of Lozova was stuck on his Telegram channel, alleging that Russian forces were responsible for the attack. Kharkiv regional governor Oleg Sinegubov said eight people had been wounded, including an 11-year-old girl. US vice president Kamala Harris had a phone call with France president Emmanuel Macron about how to support Ukraine amid Russia’s invasion, among other issues. Here is a readout of the phone call from the vice president’s office: Vice President Kamala Harris today spoke with President Emmanuel Macron of France. The Vice President reiterated her strong support for the close alliance between the United States and France, and congratulated the President on his recent re-election. Vice President Harris and President Macron discussed their determination to continue to support the people of Ukraine in the wake of Russia’s unprovoked and unjustified invasion, as well as the global food and security challenges exacerbated by the conflict. In the aftermath of the horrific mass shooting in Buffalo, New York, they discussed the importance of combatting the epidemic of hate, violence, and racism in both countries and around the world. Russia has taken control of the Azovstal steel plant, the country’s defence ministry said on Friday evening. “Underground structures of Azovstal where militants were hiding are now under full control of Russian armed forces,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that in total 2,439 Ukrainian fighters have surrendered. Pro-Kremlin telegram channels also released a video with Sergei Volynsky, the commander of the 36th Marine Brigade unit, in which he said that his unit has surrendered. The unit was one of the main forces defending the steelworks. If confirmed, the full abandonment of the bunkers and tunnels of the bombed-out plant would signify the end of the destructive siege that has been going on for two months. Russia earlier said that over 900 Ukrainian troops who were at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steel plant have been sent to a prison colony on Russian-controlled territory. The Kremlin’s spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, said the combatants would be treated in line with international norms for PoWs, though several senior Russian politicians demanded this week they be put on trial and one even called for their execution. A Bosnia Serb nationalist leader has said that Bosnia cannot join EU sanctions against Russia in order to stay neutrality, reports Reuters. Bosnian Serb nationalist leader Milorad Dodik told European Council President Charles Michel on Friday that Bosnia needs to maintain neutrality and not join EU sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. Michel visited Bosnia as part of his short tour of the Western Balkan countries aimed at reaffirming the bloc’s support for their EU integration plans and to invite them to join a new EU geopolitical community in light of the ongoing political and economic challenges. While embracing the EU’s renewed commitment to supporting Bosnia’s path to joining the bloc, Dodik, who is a Serb member of the country’s three-man inter-ethnic presidency, used the opportunity to outline the stance of Bosnian Serbs towards the war in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia. “I think it is of utmost importance for Bosnia to remain neutral,” Dodik said at a joint news conference with Michel and presidency Bosniak chairman Sefik Dzaferovic. “In conditions in which we exist, it would be a problem for us to impose any kind of sanctions and join the EU or global sanctions.” Dodik was speaking on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs, who have been nurturing close ties with Russia based on their common Orthodox Christian religion, as has Serbia which also refused to impose sanctions on Russia. “Besides showing solidarity with the European Union in this regard, I think that we could have grave economic consequences that would be multiplied compared to EU countries which have collective security mechanisms,” Dodik said. Bosnia’s tripartite presidency has not adopted a common stance on the war in Ukraine but its Bosniak and Croat members have strongly condemned the Russian invasion and supported all EU decisions.’ Twenty-seven years after the end of a war that claimed about 100,000 lives, the three nationalist ethnic elites are keeping the Balkan country politically divided and prone to endemic corruption while its citizens are leaving en masse. This just in: Russia just announced that they have taken control of the Azovstal steel plant. More details to come. Russia has not used laser weaponry in Ukraine, said the US Pentagon today, reports Reuters. After Russia claimed that it was fielding laser technology that could strike enemy drones, Pentagon officials quickly disputed the claim, saying that Russia has not used such technology before. “We don’t have any indication of the use of lasers, at least weaponized lasers, in Ukraine. Nothing to confirm on that,” said Pentagon spokesman John Kirby during a news briefing. A semi-naked demonstrator protesting sexual violence in Ukraine was escorted off the red carpet at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival, reports Reuters. While on the red carpet, the unidentified women tore off her gown, revealing the Ukrainian flag colours and the words “STOP RAPING US” written on her abdomen. Red handprints were also painted on her buttocks. Security officials quickly wrapped a jacket around the woman and removed her from the red carpet. A US consular officer visited detained basketball player Brittney Griner in Russia yesterday, reports Reuters. State department spokesperson Ned Price commented on the visit today, saying: The consular officer found her continuing to do as well as could be expected under these exceedingly challenging circumstances. Following the visit, the US has insisted that Russia give the US regular access to Griner and other detainees. Here’s more on intense fighting in near the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk from the Guardian’s Peter Beaumont: Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. “In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There’s hell, and that’s not an exaggeration,” Zelenskiy said. “The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk … 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army – all this is not just hostilities during the war.” According to multiple sources, Russian troops were pushing west of the Russian-occupied town of Popasna and also attempting to gain ground to the north of Severodonetsk, advancing more than 10km in at least one region with residents fleeing under shellfire. The focus of the main Russian advance appeared to be the town of Soledar amid speculation that their initial aim was to cut one of the main supply routes to thousands of Ukrainian defenders, who are outnumbered by Russian forces.

Here’s where we stand: Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders.

In a video statement, Prokopenko said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant. A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken of inside the plant, writing: “Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life.” G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, warned that Moscow is f0rming 12 new units in its western military district in response to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid. He also said that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers who were barricaded in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks have surrendered so far. The number of combatants who have surrendered has not been independently verified. Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler, Gasum, starting from Saturday. Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he will speak to Finland tomorrow regarding its bid to join Nato and maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s membership bids. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, and that he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow. A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court. Vadim Shysimarin, 21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill” on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. The United States has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Dmitry Medvedev, a former president of Russia, warned that Russia would not continue food supplies unless the west eased its sanctions on the Kremlin. Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. That’s it from me, Léonie Chao-Fong, as I hand the blog over to my colleague, Gloria Oladipo, in New York. I will be back on Monday. Thank you. Senior Russian officials have proposed a new law that would eliminate age limits for military contract soldiers, in another sign the country is facing a shortage of infantry to continue its offensive in Ukraine. Two members of the ruling United Russia party who introduced the law said the move would enable the military to utilise the skills of older professionals. “For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45,” it said. Currently, Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the army. The lawmakers added that the proposed legislation would also make it easier to recruit civilian medics, engineers and operations and communications specialists. Military experts say Russia is facing unsustainable troop and equipment losses in Ukraine after a series of military setbacks that have forced Moscow to reduce its war aims. Russia initially put about 80% of its main ground combat forces – 150,000 men – into the war in February, according to western officials. In the 82 days since, it has “suffered losses of one third of the ground combat force it committed,” British military intelligence claimed last week. The Russian military has also faced issues of low morale among its troops, as reports have emerged that hundreds of troops are unwilling to fight in what Russia calls its “special military operation”. “Russia lacks sufficient ground units with contract soldiers for a sustainable rotation. The troops are getting exhausted – they won’t be able to keep this up for a long period,” said Rob Lee, a military analyst. The US has accused Russia of holding the world’s food supply hostage during the Ukraine crisis, amid growing fears of famine in developing countries. Speaking at a UN security council meeting, the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, demanded Russia lift its blockade of Ukraine’s Black Sea ports and enable the flow of food and fertiliser around the world. At least seven people, including a child, have been injured in a Russian missile attack on the town of Lozova in the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine, according to reports. The missile had targeted “the newly-renovated House of Culture” in Lozova, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said in a statement on social media. A video of the attack shared by Zelenskiy showed thick smoke enveloping a large building near residential complexes and passing cars. Zelenskiy said: The occupiers have identified culture, education and humanity as their enemies. And they do not spare missiles or bombs. A statement by the chief of the local emergency medical centre, Viktor Zabashta, said at least seven people, including an 11-year-old child, were injured in the missile attack. From Ukraine’s culture and information policy minister, Oleksandr Tkachenko: A trip to the mall in Russia is a different experience today than it was just a few short months ago. “When I had my first child, there was all this choice. Mothercare, Zara, you name it,” said Evgenia Marsheva, a 33-year-old architect. But when she went shopping in Moscow this month for her newborn, many of those large retail brands had been shuttered. “Now, I can only find very cheap or extremely expensive Russian products. I was brought up with tales of the limited choices that my parents had during the Soviet Union. I never thought that would come back.” Three months into the war, Russia has become the most sanctioned country in the world, and almost 1,000 foreign brands – the majority of them voluntarily – have curtailed their operations there, according to records kept by the Yale School of Management. The exodus of companies continued this week with McDonald’s officially announcing it would leave Russia after three decades. Helped by surging prices for oil and gas exports, the Kremlin has so far been able to continue financing its war efforts, with the country spending as much as $300m (£240m) a day on defence last month, double that of the prewar period, according to finance ministry data. Meanwhile, capital controls that Russia imposed to shield its financial sector in late February have made the rouble the world’s best-performing currency. Yet, for many in Moscow and other Russian cities, the country’s growing political and economic isolation is having a direct impact on their livelihoods. “Since the conflict started, every step in the production line is a struggle,” said Vladimir Kukushkin, a director of a printing company in Ekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city. Read the full article by Pjotr Sauer: Cosmopolitan no more: Russians feel sting of cultural and economic rift France’s foreign ministry said it launched its first medical evacuation flight from Poland for wounded Ukrainians and child cancer patients. The flight today evacuated seven Ukrainians wounded in the war, as well as three Ukrainian children with cancer and their carers, the ministry said in a statement. The patients will be treated at the expense of France in hospitals across the country, it said. Russian gas giant Gazprom’s exporting arm, Gazprom Export, has confirmed it will suspend gas sales for Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler, Gasum, starting from Saturday. Gazprom Export said the move was because the Finnish company had not paid it for gas delivered in April under new Russian rules requiring settlement in roubles, Reuters reports. It added that it would defend its interests in arbitration proceedings initiated by the Finnish company. Aerial footage appears to show a bridge in eastern Ukraine’s embattled region of Luhansk being blown up. The video, released by Ukraine’s National Guard on Wednesday, is said to show a joint special operation between Ukraine’s security forces fighting to slow the advance of Russian troops in Luhansk. The Guardian has independently verified the location, which shows the Borova River Bridge, connecting Severodonetsk and Lysychansk to the city of Rubizhne. It’s almost 7pm in Kyiv. Here’s where we stand: Intense fighting has been reported around the Ukrainian city of Severodonetsk as Russian forces appear to be stepping up an offensive to encircle its Ukrainian defenders. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the eastern provinces of Luhansk and Donetsk – known collectively as the Donbas – were being turned into “hell” and warned that what he called the “final stage of the war” would be the bloodiest. Russian troops fired on a school in Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region, killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haidai, said. Ukrainian soldiers have finally ended their defence of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, Prokopenko said civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the plant.

Previously only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 could enter into a first contract with the military. US intelligence officials are reportedly sceptical that Vladimir Putin would be persuaded to end the war in Ukraine even if there was a dramatic change in Russian public opinion. Officials also doubt the war is likely to lead to the removal of the Russian president from power, at least in the short term, CNN reports.

noon from London, I’m Léonie Chao-Fong and I’ll continue to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to get in touch on Twitter or via email. Canada has announced additional sanctions on Russian oligarchs as well as a ban on the import and export of targeted luxury goods from Russia. The latest measures would put restrictions on 14 individuals including Russian oligarchs, their family members, and close associates of Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, according to an official statement. The statement read: These individuals have directly enabled Vladimir Putin’s senseless war in Ukraine and bear responsibility for the pain and suffering of the people of Ukraine. The import ban would target Russian goods including alcoholic beverages, seafood, and non-industrial diamonds. The export ban would target luxury goods such as footwear, luxury clothing and jewellery. Germany will deliver the first 15 Gepard tanks to Ukraine in July, a defence ministry spokesperson confirmed. Germany’s defence minister, Christine Lambrecht, had agreed on this delivery in a conversation with her Ukrainian counterpart, Oleksii Reznikov, via video link, the spokesperson added. Last month, Germany announced that it would for the first time supply Ukraine with heavy weapons, namely Gepard air-defence tanks, after accusations it had initially dragged its heels on heavy weapons deliveries to Kyiv. Since then, Germany has also pledged seven self-propelled Howitzers to Kyiv and has started training Ukrainian troops on them. The US embassy in Moscow said he was surprised, but not offended, by a proposal to name a nearby intersection ‘Defenders of Donbas Square’. Earlier this week, the Russian capital’s city assembly said its members were considering naming the intersection after soldiers fighting alleged “Nazism” in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine. Kyiv and the West say the allegation of fascism is a baseless pretext for an unprovoked act of aggression. In response, the US embassy suggested disingenuously that it was to honour Ukrainian soldiers fighting Russian aggression, Reuters reports. The embassy said: Surprised but not offended by the Russian government’s proposal to rename a part of downtown Moscow near the U.S. Embassy ‘Defenders of Donbas Square’, presumably in honour of Ukrainian soldiers bravely defending their homeland from Kremlin aggression. The country should know its heroes. Russian troops fired on a school in Severodonetsk in eastern Ukraine’s Luhansk region, killing three adults, according to a Ukrainian official. More than 200 people, including children, were sheltering at the school when the attack took place this morning, the head of the Luhansk Regional State Administration, Serhiy Haidai, said. Writing on Telegram, Haidai said police are trying to transport people to another shelter. Around 11,000 houses, of which almost 3,000 were high-rise buildings, have been “partially or completely destroyed” in Luhansk, he said. The hospital continues to operate in the city, where several doctors and other staff remain, Ukraine’s Hromadske reports, citing the head of the Severodonetsk military administration, Oleksandr Stryuk. It has not been able to independently verify this information. A Russian tank commander who pleaded guilty earlier this week to shooting dead an unarmed Ukrainian civilian has said he will accept any punishment from the court, on the third day of the first war crimes trial resulting from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Vadim Shysimarin,21, told courtroom No 201 of the Kyiv tribunal that he “was nervous about what was going on” on the day 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov died and that he “didn’t want to kill”. Standing in the glass defence box, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, his shaved head lowered, Shysimarin added: “I’m truly and sincerely sorry. I didn’t want that to happen, I didn’t want to be there, but it happened. I would like to apologise once again. And I will accept all the measures of punishment that I will be offered.” In closing arguments, Shysimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov, said his client was not guilty of premeditated murder and war crimes, and asked the judges to acquit him. In an interview with the Guardian at the end of the hearing, Ovsyannikov said his client killed a civilian by order and therefore he did not consider it to be a breach of the rules of war. “There is an absence of intent here,” he said. “It was an execution of an order … he didn’t want to kill him, and this has certain legal meaning. “I would single out those bastards that shot at the back of civilians’ heads in Bucha during the occupation,” Ovsyannikov added. “It’s quite different from the circumstances my client was in.” Read more of Lorenzo Tondo’s report from Kyiv: Russian soldier says he will accept punishment for Ukraine war crime President Vladimir Putin has said that the number of cyber attacks on Russia by foreign “state structures” had increased, and that Moscow would need to bolster its cyber defences by cutting the risk of using foreign software and hardware. “Purposeful attempts are being made to disable the Internet resources of Russia’s critical information infrastructure”, Reuters reports Putin saying. Finland and Sweden have announced their intention to submit simultaneous requests to join Nato, in what is seen as a seismic shift in Europe’s security architecture. In this new video explainer, Jon Henley, our Europe correspondent, looks at why the Nordic countries are shifting away from years of neutrality, and what the move means for the war in Ukraine. US intelligence officials are reportedly sceptical that Vladimir Putin would be persuaded to end the war in Ukraine even if there was a dramatic change in Russian public opinion. Officials also doubt the war is likely to lead to the removal of the Russian president from power, at least in the short term, CNN reports multiple sources as saying. Intelligence officials believe Putin is keenly sensitive to small shifts in public opinion, but his ability to crack down on protests and control the media has allowed him to be insulated against any significant popular rising. The assessment reflects the extent to which the US believes Putin has cemented his control over Russia. Sources told CNN Putin directly participates in decision-making such as the location of attack lines and day-to-day operational goals. One senior Nato official said: He clearly is his own decision maker. He doesn’t seem to rely even on experts within the government or the cabinet very much. So it’s a bit hard to imagine that popular opinion sways him all that much. The intelligence assessment raises questions about the effectiveness of Western sanctions against Russia, CNN reports. Russian forces have turned the Donbas region, where Vladimir Putin’s soldiers are currently focusing their efforts, into “hell”, Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in his latest nightly address. The Ukrainian president said Russian troops have killed “many” people in the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine, and that Russia was engaged in a “deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible”. The EU has disbursed €600m (£508m) to Ukraine as part of a financial assistance programme, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said. Ukraine’s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, tweeted that he was grateful to the European Commission and von der Leyen, adding: We will win and rebuild Ukraine together. G7 industrialised nations have pledged $19.8bn (£15.9bn or €18.7bn) to bolster Ukraine’s public finances as Kyiv battles Russia’s invasion, a closing statement of the group’s finance ministers said. The Group of Seven’s financial leaders – representing the US, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Italy – promised enough money to keep Ukraine’s devastated economy afloat as long as the war continues. Germany’s finance minister, Christian Lindner, told reporters that $9.5bn of the total was mobilised at meetings of the G7 finance ministers in Koenigswinter, Germany, this week. A G7 statement read: We agreed on concrete actions to deepen multilateral economic cooperation and underlined our commitment to our united response to Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine and to our unwavering support to Ukraine. The US treasury secretary, Janet Yellen, told reporters late yesterday: The message was, ‘We stand behind Ukraine’. We’re going to pull together with the resources that they need to get through this. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said he will speak to Finland tomorrow regarding its bid to join Nato, Reuters reports. Erdoğan told reporters he had discussed the issue with the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, today. He said he would also be speaking to Britain tomorrow, but did not specify who he would talk to in Finland or Britain. He maintained his opposition to Finland and Sweden’s applications to join the military alliance. A Ukrainian fighter who shared a series of powerful photographs while defending the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol appears to have been taken captive by Russian forces. Dmytro Kozatskyi posted images of wounded soldiers holed up inside the besieged steel plant that made headlines worldwide. In a message posted on Twiter this morning, he wrote: Well, that’s all. Thank you from the shelter, Azovstal is the place of my death and my life. In a separate tweet, he posted a link to a Google drive containing images he had taken of inside the plant, writing: By the way, while I am in captivity, I will leave you photos of the best quality. Send them to all journalistic awards and photo contests. If I win something, it will be very nice after the release. Thank you all for your support. “Tweets from state-backed sources containing misinformation about the Ukraine invasion will be covered with a warning notice that users will have to click through before accessing the content, Twitter has announced. The social media platform has unveiled a new crisis misinformation policy that will tackle false and misleading statements and coverage during times of crisis, such as armed conflict, natural disasters and public health emergencies. Tweets that will be affected include: false coverage or event reporting; false allegations around the use of force or weapons; demonstrably false allegations of war crimes; and false information regarding international community responses or humanitarian actions. Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, said content that falls foul of the new policy will not be pushed to users, including in their home timeline, and warning notices will be appended to “highly visible” tweets including tweets from “high-profile accounts, such as state-affiliated media accounts, verified, official government accounts”. Twitter said the first iteration of its policy will be focused on international armed conflict, starting with Ukraine. Russian state media organisations have already been banned in Europe across multiple social media platforms, including Twitter. Russia’s state-owned oil company, Rosneft, said Germany’s former chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and businessman, Matthias Warnig, had informed it they could not continue serving on the board of directors. It comes after the European Parliament urged that Schroeder be blacklisted if he did not step down from the board of Rosneft, Reuters reports. Schroeder, who served as German chancellor from 1998 to 2005, has come under intense public criticism for retaining his lucrative board position with Rosneft, which he had held since 2017. In a statement, Rosneft said it was “sympathetic” to the decision by Schroeder and Warnig and thanked them for their “continued support”. Civilians and heavily wounded Ukrainian fighters have been evacuated from the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol, according to the commander of Ukraine’s Azov regiment, Denys Prokopenko. In a video statement, Prokopenko said: We have constantly emphasised the three most important conditions for us: civilians, wounded and dead. The civilians have been evacuated. The heavily wounded received the necessary assistance and they were evacuated, to be later exchanged and delivered to territory controlled by Ukraine The process of taking out the bodies of those who had died defending Azovstal was still ongoing, he said. Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers at the steel plant had surrendered so far, but the number of combatants has not been independently verified. The fate of those troops who were holed up at the besieged Azocstal steel plant remains uncertain. The International Committee of the Red Cross said yesterday that it was undertaking a process of registering those fleeing Azovstal into Russian detention as prisoners of war. Russia will stop gas flows to neighbouring Finland on Saturday morning, Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said in a statement. The company has refused to pay Gazprom Export in roubles as Russia has requested European countries to do. The statement by Gasum read: On the afternoon of Friday May 20, Gazprom Export informed Gasum that natural gas supplies to Finland under Gasum’s supply contract will be cut on Saturday 21 May at 04.00 (GMT). The company will continue to supply gas to customers in Finland from other sources through the Balticconnector pipeline. Gasum CEO, Mika Wiljanen, described the news as “regrettable” and sought to reassure customers that there would be enough gas in the coming months: We have been carefully preparing for this situation and provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months. Some more lines from Russia’s defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, who warned that Moscow is taking “adequate countermeasures” in response to Finland and Sweden’s Nato bid. Sweden and Finland joining the military alliance have led to an increase in military threats near the border, Shoigu was quoted by Interfax as saying. He was also quoted by Ria news agency, which is owned by the Russian state, as saying that Moscow would respond to these threats by forming 12 new units in its western military district. Hello, it’s Léonie Chao-Fong with you today to bring you all the latest developments from the war in Ukraine. Feel free to drop me a message if you have anything to flag, you can reach me on Twitter or via email. Russia is engaged in a “deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address, accusing Moscow of committing genocide. He also said Russian forces had turned the Donbas region, where they are currently focusing their efforts, into “hell” and said they had killed “many” people in the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine. There was no “military explanation” for the killing and destruction, he said. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers who were barricaded in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks have surrendered so far. Serhiy Gaidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has given a short update on the situation in Severodonetsk. He said “The Russians are shelling Severodonetsk very powerfully. Up to 15,000 people remain in bomb shelters. 70% of high-rise buildings are destroyed or damaged.” The latest operational update from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces says that “Fourteen enemy attacks were repulsed in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions over the past 24 hours”. Once Russia has secured Mariupol it will likely redeploy forces there to the Donbas, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update, adding that due to the pressure Russian commanders are under however, they will probably do so “without adequate preparation”. Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko has accused Russia of shelling “for the sake of shelling” in the Luhansk region. She said “They’re just shelling the cities in the Luhansk region for the sake of shelling, and of inflicting fear and more pain and tragedy among the population in an effort to make the people surrender.” The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskiy, has said it was a quiet night in the region. He said there had been one air alert and added: “Thank you to our air defence forces that the sky over Lviv region remained calm.” Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine’s top presidential adviser and a member of the negotiating team, said a ceasefire with Russia was “impossible without total Russian troops withdrawal”. Russia’s lower house of parliament has published on its website a proposal to change the law to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. At present only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 can enter into a first contract with the military. Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde has hit back at claims by Turkey that her country harbours support for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which are part of Turkey’s objection to Sweden and Finland joining Nato. Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, has claimed there is little popular support for the move to join Nato within Sweden, and questioned why it is not being put to a referendum, accusing Sweden of being puppets of the US. Pro-Russian hackers have attacked the websites of several institutions and government ministries in Italy, police have said. The US Senate has overwhelmingly approved a $40bn infusion of military and economic aid for Ukraine and its allies as both parties rallied behind America’s latest financial salvo against Russia’s invasion. US secretary of state Antony Blinken has accused Russia of using “food as a weapon” by blockading Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. Léonie Chao-Fong will be along next to continue our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Sweden’s foreign minister Ann Linde has hit back at claims by Turkey that her country harbours support for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). She has tweeted: Due to the vastly spread disinformation about Sweden and the PKK, we would like to recall that the government of Olof Palme was first after Turkey to list PKK as a terrorist organization, already in 1984. EU followed suit 2002, when Anna Lindh was Sweden’s foreign minister. This position remains unchanged. Turkey’s president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has recently doubled down on his threat to veto Finland’s and Sweden’s applications for membership of Nato over the PKK issue. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu has said that almost 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers who were barricaded in Mariupol’s Azovstal steelworks have surrendered so far, according to reports from the Tass news agency. The number of combatants who have surrendered has not been independently verified. The International Committee of the Red Cross said yesterday that it was undertaking a process of registering those fleeing Azovstal into Russian detention as prisoners of war. Pro-Russian hackers have attacked the websites of several institutions and government ministries in Italy, Italian police have said. Italian cybersecurity group Yarix said in a statement the attack was launched on Thursday evening by the hacker group known as Killnet. Earlier this morning, it was still not possible to access the websites of the Italian foreign ministry and its national magistrates association. Reuters reports that a similar attack took place on 11 May, and last weekend police said they had thwarted a cyber-assault on the latter stages of the Eurovision song contest in Turin. Russia’s lower house of parliament has published on its website a proposal to change the law to allow Russians over 40 and foreigners over 30 to sign up for the military. Reuters reports the website claims “For the use of high-precision weapons, the operation of weapons and military equipment, highly professional specialists are needed. Experience shows that they become such by the age of 40-45.” Previously only Russians aged 18-40 and foreigners aged 18-30 could enter into a first contract with the military. The latest operational update from the general staff of Ukraine’s armed forces carries these unverified claims: Fourteen enemy attacks were repulsed in the Donetsk and Luhansk directions over the past 24 hours, eight tanks, fourteen units of combat armoured vehicles and six units of enemy vehicles were destroyed. Air defence units shot down one Orlan-10 drone. They also say that “Russian enemy naval groups in the Black and Azov Seas continue to block civilian shipping”. Here are some of the latest images that we have been sent from Mariupol over the newswires. The governor of Lviv, Maksym Kozytskiy, has posted to Telegram to report that it was a quiet night in the region. He said there had been one air alert and added: “Thank you to our air defence forces that the sky over Lviv region remained calm.” Lviv is in the far west of Ukraine, away from the main military theatre in the Donbas to the east of the country. The Ukrainian MP Lesia Vasylenko has been interviewed by Sky News in the UK, and has accused Russia of shelling “for the sake of shelling” in the Luhansk region. She accused the Russian forces of purposefully making it difficult to leave areas of conflict. She said: They’re just shelling the cities in the Luhansk region for the sake of shelling, and of inflicting fear and more pain and tragedy among the population in an effort to make the people surrender. She said she could not see an end to war, adding: “I personally do not believe in no peaceful resolution.” I don’t see how it could be possible at this point in time, when both sides are extremely fired up to go on to the end. And the Russians with the propaganda that we hear coming from Russia, set on killing every single Ukrainian. But, she said, it was down to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He is the one who has started this war back in 2014. He is the one who gave the orders to escalate on the 24 February this year. And he is the one who can make the decision to actually sit down at proper negotiations and see what can be done to end this war. Vasylenko had a defiant message for Russia, saying: We as a nation are united around the fact that we fight until the victory of Ukraine. Right until the very last Russian soldier leaves the territory of Ukraine and is pushed back beyond the borders and back into Russia. Because we are fighting for our land and we want to live as a free and independent country. Serhiy Gaidai, Ukraine’s governor of Luhansk, has given a short update on the situation in Severodonetsk. He writes on Telegram: The Russians are shelling Severodonetsk very powerfully. Up to 15,000 people remain in bomb shelters. Wells in the old districts of the city were preserved to provide people with water. All mobile towers are de-energized. 70% of high-rise buildings are destroyed or damaged, many of them need to be demolished and new ones built. Maria Zakharova, spokesperson for Russia’s foreign ministry, has just published a broadside on Telegram about Sweden’s move to join Nato. Claiming that there is little popular support for the move within Sweden, she asks why there is no referendum to be held on the change in policy. She accuses Sweden of being a puppet of the US, writing: Speaking of “friends”, it is notable that US senators were visiting Stockholm on the day the “historic” decision was announced. Not rank-and-file congressmen, but leader of the Senate Republicans Mitch McConnell. Sweden has not yet joined the alliance, but the Americans are already dictating to the Swedish authorities what to say to their people. And this is just a demo of what is in store for them. More than 200 years of neutrality, which guaranteed the Kingdom’s security and prosperity, are now history. So why wasn’t there a referendum? Just because no one has been consulting Swedish public’s opinion on anything for a long time now. The Americans call the shots for the Swedes. This is Martin Belam taking over the live blog. You can reach me at martin.belam@theguardian.com Russian shelling in Ukraine’s eastern region of Luhansk has killed 13 civilians over the past 24 hours, the regional governor, Serhiy Gaidai, has said according to Reuters. Twelve were killed in the town of Sievierodonesk, where a Russian assault has been unsuccessful, he said. The town and the city of Lysychansk are in an area where Russian troops have launched an offensive. More reporting well worth reading is the New York Times’ investigation of atrocities allegedly committed by Russian forces in Bucha, outside Kyiv. A warning that this report also contains distressing video and images. The US paper has uncovered fresh video evidence tying Russian forces to the execution of eight Ukrainian captives on 4 March. Moscow has repeatedly denied reports of wrongdoing during its occupation of the town and the Times said Russia’s ministries of defence and foreign affairs did not respond to fresh requests for comment. A Russian senator has claimed that the reason for Russia’s slow progress in Ukraine is because its forces are basically fighting against fellow Russians, the BBC’s Francis Scarr reports. Russia’s “special military operation” was proceeding with “quite some difficulty”, Frants Klintsevich said on Russian state television, adding that he didn’t want to offend anyone. However, he reasoned, the slow progress was because “we’re fighting one of the strongest and best trained armies. We’re fighting against Russian soldiers and officers with exactly the same mentality as ours.” Once Russia has secured Mariupol it will likely redeploy forces there to the Donbas, the UK’s Ministry of Defence has said in its latest intelligence update, adding that due to the pressure Russian commanders are under however, they will probably do so “without adequate preparation”. Staunch Ukrainian resistance in Mariupol since the start of the war means Russian forces in the area must be re-equipped and refurbished before they can be redeployed effectively. This can be a lengthy process when done thoroughly. Russian commanders, however, are under pressure to demonstrably achieve operational objectives. This means that Russia will probably redistribute their forces swiftly without adequate preparation, which risks further force attrition. The MoD said up to 1,700 Ukrainian fighters in Mariupol’s Azovstal steel plant had surrendered in recent days, with an unknown number still inside. In case you missed it, it is really worth checking out this extraordinary report from AP, based on the bodycam recordings of a Mariupol medic that were smuggled out in March by an AP team, the last international journalists in the city. A warning though, that the report contains graphic imagery and distressing scenes. Yuliia Paievska is well known within Ukraine under the name Taira and was a member of the Ukraine Invictus Games for military veterans, where she was set to compete in archery and swimming. She had been given the camera in 2021 to film for a Netflix documentary series on inspirational figures being produced by Britain’s Prince Harry. But when Russian forces invaded, she used it to shoot scenes of injured civilians and soldiers instead. On 16 March, the day after she handed the camera’s data card to AP, Taira was captured by Russian forces, along with her driver, Serhiy. The last time she was seen was in a Russian news broadcast on 21 March, in which she reads a statement calling for an end to the fighting. The US Senate has overwhelmingly approved a $40bn infusion of military and economic aid for Ukraine and its allies as both parties rallied behind America’s latest, and quite possibly not last, financial salvo against Russia’s invasion. The 86-11 vote gave final congressional approval to the package, three weeks after Joe Biden requested a smaller $33bn version and after a lone Republican opponent delayed Senate passage for a week. Every voting Democrat and all but 11 Republicans – including many of the chamber’s supporters of Donald Trump’s isolationist agenda – backed the measure. “Help is on the way, really significant help. Help that could make sure that the Ukrainians are victorious,” said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, underscoring a goal that seemed nearly unthinkable when Russia launched its assault in February. More on the US package here: Russia is engaged in a “deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible,” Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said in his latest nightly address, accusing Moscow of committing genocide. He also said Russian forces had turned the Donbas region, where they are currently focusing their efforts, into “hell” and said they had killed “many” people in the Chernihiv region in northern Ukraine. There was no “military explanation” for the killing and destruction, he said. In Donbas, the occupiers are trying to increase pressure. There’s hell, and that’s not an exaggeration. The brutal and absolutely pointless bombing of Severodonetsk ... 12 dead and dozens wounded in just one day. The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army - all this is not just hostilities during the war. Russian strikes at the Chernihiv region, in particular the terrible strike at Desna, debris clearance continues, many dead; constant strikes at the Odesa region, at the cities of central Ukraine, Donbas is completely destroyed - all this doesn’t and cannot have any military explanation for Russia. This is a deliberate and criminal attempt to kill as many Ukrainians as possible. Destroy as many houses, social facilities and enterprises as possible. This is what will be qualified as the genocide of the Ukrainian people and for which the occupiers will definitely be brought to justice. Hello, I’m Helen Livingstone, welcome to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. A roundup of the most recent developments: Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the Donbas, where Russia is now concentrating its main effort, has been “completely destroyed”. “There’s hell, and that’s not an exaggeration,” he said in his nightly address. “The bombing and shelling of other cities, the air and missile strikes of the Russian army – all this is not just hostilities during the war.” US secretary of state Antony Blinken has accused Russia of using “food as a weapon” by blockading Ukraine’s Black Sea ports. But Dmitry Medvedev, Russia’s former president and now senior security official, says the west should not expect Russia to continue food supplies if it slaps Moscow with devastating sanctions over Ukraine. “ Things don’t work like that, we’re not idiots.” The US Congress has approved $40bn in military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine, with both parties eagerly backing the effort. Final passage came as Blinken said the US had authorised shipping Ukraine another $100m worth of weapons and equipment from Pentagon stocks. Mykhailo Podolyak, Ukraine’s top presidential adviser and a member of the negotiating team, said a ceasefire with Russia was “impossible without total Russian troops withdrawal”. Podolyak said Kyiv was not interested in a new “Minsk”, referring to the 2015 Minsk agreement, brokered by France and Germany, which attempted to secure a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russia-backed separatists in the east of Ukraine. Russia has said a further 771 Ukrainian troops have “surrendered” at Mariupol’s besieged Azovstal steelworks, bringing the total number to 1,730 this week, while the International Committee of the Red Cross said it had started registering the Ukrainian prisoners of war who left the plant. It is not clear how many remain at the plant. Putin’s youngest daughter, Katerina Tikhonova, flew to Munich, Germany, “more than 50 times” between 2017 and 2019, travelling on chartered flights with full state support, according to an investigation by Germany’s Spiegel magazine and independent Russian media outlet iStories. Her enthusiasm for Europe appears to match that of the oligarch “scum and traitors” Putin has decried since the start of the war. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old tank commander, asked a Ukrainian widow to forgive him for the murder of her husband after pleading guilty on Wednesday to killing an unarmed 62-year-old civilian in the north-east Ukrainian village of Chupakhivka on 28 February. Russia’s promise to use lasers to shoot down drones in Ukraine has prompted widespread scepticism that the novel and possibly nuclear-powered weaponry could be deployed on the battlefield or have any significant impact on the war. Zelenskiy described it as a “wunderwaffe” – a nonexistent “wonder weapon” that was originally a propaganda invention of the Nazis. The US president, Joe Biden, said Finland and Sweden “meet every Nato requirement and then some” to join the alliance and have the “full, complete backing” of the US. Speaking at a joint press conference at the White House with Sweden’s prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, and Finland’s president, Sauli Niinistö, he also said he was confident Turkey’s concerns regarding their membership could be addressed. The former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder will lose some of his post-office privileges after failing to cut his links with Russian energy companies over the Ukraine war, the Bundestag’s budgetary committee has decided. Schröder – chancellor from 1998 to 2005 – will be stripped of his office and staff, which cost about €419,000 ($443,000) in taxpayers’ money in 2021. G7 financial leaders have agreed on $18.4bn aid to help Ukraine and said they were ready to stand by Kyiv and “do more as needed”, according to a draft communique seen by Reuters. Finance ministers and central bank governors of the US, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany, France and Italy are holding talks as Ukraine is running out of cash. McDonald’s has reached a deal to sell all its restaurants in Russia to one of its licensees in the country, the businessman Alexander Govor, who will operate them under a new name. More than a million Ukrainian refugees have already returned home, according to the country’s ambassador to the UK," Vadym Prystaiko. He said the mayors of Kyiv and Kharkiv had had to tell people not to return to the cities as it was still unsafe.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Himars: what are the advanced rockets US is sending Ukraine? ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/01/himars-what-are-the-advanced-rockets-us-is-sending-ukraine,2022-06-01T03:32:35Z,"High Mobility Artillery Rocket System can hit Russian targets up to 50 miles (80km) away, helping to ‘even the playing field’","Joe Biden has announced the US will send advanced missile systems to Ukraine. The new weapon is the Himars multiple launch rocket system, or MLRS: a mobile unit that can simultaneously launch multiple precision-guided missiles. Both Ukraine and Russia already operate MLRS, but Himars has superior range and precision. What system will the US provide? The M142 Himars system (High Mobility Artillery Rocket System) is a modernised, lighter and more agile wheel-mounted version of the track-mounted M270 MLRS developed in the 1970s for US and allied forces. The Himars that Washington is providing to Ukraine will have a range of about 50 miles (80km), a US official told reporters. Himars units carry one preloaded pod of six 227mm guided missiles (the M270 carries two pods), or one large pod loaded with an Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) tactical missile. The US will not supply Ukraine with the ATACMS, which has a range of 300km. With a small crew, the Himars can remove a spent pod and load a fresh one in minutes, without other vehicles helping. The crews will require some training. The US military already has Himars units in Europe; and Nato allies Poland and Romania have acquired the systems. Why are they valuable? Himars will give Ukraine’s forces the ability to strike further behind Russian lines, and at distances better protected from Russia’s own long-range weaponry. The GPS-guided missiles the Himars shoots have a range about double that of the M777 howitzers that the US recently supplied to Ukraine forces. At roughly 80km it generally puts Himars out of range of Russia’s own artillery, while placing the Russian batteries at risk. It also could threaten Russian supply depots, amid western belief that the Russian forces suffer logistical problems. Some analysts have said Himars can be a “game-changer” in the war at a time when Ukraine forces appear to be struggling under Russian artillery fire. But others say Himars will not suddenly turn the tables. “The Himars would even the playing field,” a senior US defence official said. Why is Washington limiting the range? The US president wrote in the New York Times that the advanced rockets will enable the Ukrainians “to more precisely strike key targets on the battlefield in Ukraine”. Yet the US plans to limit the range of the missiles it gives Ukraine to avoid them being used to hit targets deep inside Russia. “We are not going to send to Ukraine rocket systems that can strike into Russia,” Biden said. Since Russia invaded on 24 February, the US has been sensitive about taking any action to support Kyiv that might provoke Moscow to take the war beyond Ukraine’s borders. That has included not overtly backing Ukraine strikes inside Russian territory. Several times Ukraine has used its own rockets, drones and helicopters to hit nearby Russian targets in neighbouring Kursk and Belgorod oblasts. If the US provided ATACMS, they would theoretically have the ability to strike major Russian urban centres and military bases, including airfields from where attacks on Ukraine are launched. “[The] Ukrainians have given assurances they will not use these systems against Russian territory,” a US official said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Zelenskiy hails Ukraine’s Eurovision win and plans to ‘one day’ host final in Mariupol,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/15/zelenskiy-hails-ukraines-eurovision-win-and-plans-to-one-day-host-final-in-mariupol,2022-05-15T04:37:22Z,Ukraine president said ‘victorious chord’ in war with Russia was not far off as nation celebrates Kalush Orchestra’s win,"On Saturday night, far from the ruins that were once homes and the battlefields that were once cities, Ukraine secured an emphatic victory that had nothing to do with rifles, antitank weaponry or Molotov cocktails, and everything to do with hopeful words, folkloric dance moves and a continental eruption of cultural solidarity. Following the Kalush Orchestra’s triumph in the 2022 Eurovision song contest, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said he hoped next year’s final would take place in the besieged port city of Mariupol, which has endured some of the most merciless onslaughts of the Russian invasion. “Our courage impresses the world, our music conquers Europe! Next year Ukraine will host Eurovision!” Zelenskiy said in a Telegram post. “We will do our best to one day host the participants and guests of Eurovision in Ukrainian Mariupol. Free, peaceful, rebuilt! I am sure our victorious chord in the battle with the enemy is not far off.” Kalush Orchestra’s entry, Stefania – a rap-folk hybrid originally intended as a tribute to the mother of frontman Oleh Psiuk – swiftly proved a rallying cry in Ukraine and beyond. As the song’s lyrics, which include the lines “I’ll always find my way home, even if all roads are destroyed”, found new resonance, the group rededicated it to all Ukraine’s mothers. Many Ukrainians felt Stefania’s triumph had provided a much-needed psychological boost after almost three months of war. In a basement north of Kyiv, a group of soldiers watching the event also dared hope that next year’s final would be in Mariupol. “We had a victory – today in Eurovision, but soon we will have a victory in Ukraine-Russian war,” said Tetyana, a military medic, standing in the basement decorated with children’s paintings of the Ukraine flag and “Glory to Ukraine” signs. The tired-looking but happy soldiers had sat around a screen, some tapping rhythmically on their knees while Kalush performed, and when the winner was announced they clapped and cheered with delight. “We will also win,” said Vitaliy, another soldier. “We have shown that we can not only fight, but we can also sing very nice. The next Eurovision we will host in liberated Mariupol.” For Mykola Latsiuk, a bartender in Kyiv, the band’s decision to take part in the contest was more important than their victory. The six men who make up the group had received special permits to leave Ukraine and travel to Italy during the war. “The most important thing is that the guys went and performed,” said Latsiuk. “They supported us, and we supported them. It is important.” The track’s success will also live on in the name of a train that runs between Kyiv and Ivano-Frankivsk. The head of the railway service announced on Sunday that the number 43 train would be renamed the Stefania Express, and that stations in Kyiv, Kalush and Ivano-Frankivsk would play the song when the train rolled in. Kalush released a new music video for the track on Sunday, which showed Ukrainian servicewomen rescuing children from shelled and ruined towns. Psiuk’s mother, the eponymous Stefania, said she had been startled by her new-found celebrity and by the requests for photos when she went to her local market. “I didn’t connect it to myself – that the song was written for me,” she said. “I thought someone had made a mistake and meant his girlfriend Sasha and got the names mixed up.” Psiuk’s sister Iryna described watching the final with her mother in the band’s home town of Kalush, which lies in the foothills of the Carpathian mountains in Ukraine’s western Ivano-Frankivsk region. “She was really worried,” said Iryna. “We wept. We sat up until half past six, watching the press conference … Emotions were off the scale, we didn’t believe that our little town of Kalush would bring Ukraine victory this year in the Eurovision.” Psiuk himself took advantage of the global stage to make an impassioned plea to free the fighters still trapped beneath the sprawling Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. “Help Azovstal, right now,” he said. The European Broadcasting Union, which organises the contest, said no action would be taken against the band for using the stage to make a statement. “We understand the deep feelings around Ukraine at this moment and believe the comments of the Kalush Orchestra and other artists expressing support for the Ukrainian people to be humanitarian rather than political in nature,” the EBU said. Stefania had been bookmakers’ favourite among the 25 competing performers in the grand finale. The public vote from home, via text message or the Eurovision app, proved decisive, lifting them above the British TikTok star Sam Ryder, who led after the national juries in 40 countries cast their votes. The 439 fan votes is the highest number of televote points ever received in a Eurovision contest, now in its 66th year. Psiuk thanked the Ukrainian diaspora “and everyone around the world who voted for Ukraine”, adding: “The victory is very important to Ukraine. Especially this year.” Psuik told journalists the group wanted to “show that Ukrainian culture and Ukrainian music are alive, and they have their own and very special signature”. One of the band’s original members had stayed to fight, while the others will be back in Ukraine in two days when their temporary exit permit expires. Before traveling to Italy, Psiuk was running a volunteer organisation he set up early in the war that uses social media to help find transport and shelter for people in need. “It’s hard to say what I am going to do, because this is the first time I win Eurovision,” he said. “Like every Ukrainian, I am ready to fight and go until the end.” Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Pete Buttigieg calls for new Marshall plan to rebuild Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/20/pete-buttigieg-says-us-backs-new-marshall-plan-to-rebuild-ukraine,2022-05-24T18:35:31Z,Exclusive: Transportation secretary says there is global support for reconstruction effort to help recovery from Russian invasion,"A leading figure in the Biden administration has backed a recovery programme for Ukraine in the style of the Marshall plan, which helped rebuild Europe after the second world war. Pete Buttigieg, the US transportation secretary, said there was plenty of political will at home and internationally towards cooperating in long-term reconstruction efforts including to buttress existing infrastructure in Ukraine. “With the memory of the Marshall plan in mind, what we’re talking about is not only about how we fund immediate needs and support their ability to maintain the war effort, but how we support the ability of Ukraine to be economically viable and generate a sustainable future for themselves, even as they’re under attack,” the former presidential candidate said in an interview with the Guardian. Buttigieg admitted that while “the destruction of Ukrainian homes and infrastructure is still under way”, to talk about reconstruction might feel premature “and yet in my encounters with Ukrainian leaders, and particularly my counterpart [Oleksandr Kubrakov], who I speak to regularly, they are already thinking about reconstruction even as they’re thinking about defending their homeland and it’s inspiring to see and it deserves strong and unified support from us.” He said a “major topic of conversation” among transport ministers at the world meeting in Leipzig this week for the International Transport Forum was how they could help to get grain and other produce out of Ukraine, which is stuck because of blocked and destroyed ports and railway lines and is threatening to create a global food shortage. “This is not only something that concerns us, as friends to Ukraine, but also concerns us because the world needs that production, especially on the agricultural side,” he said. “Without access to the Black Sea, it’s always going to be a major disadvantage. We’re committed to helping there in any way we can. “But I really admire in my Ukrainian counterparts that they’re thinking about the short and the long term at the same time – how to shore up infrastructure in the immediate term – the heroic work by the railway workers to restore connections so that goods can be moved from west to east and people from east to west. “But they’re also thinking about very long-term questions and recognising that what they rebuild towards will not simply be a reconstruction of the Soviet-era infrastructure that this generation of Ukrainians has inherited.” Buttigieg was speaking on the sidelines of an event hosted by the German Marshall Fund NGO in Berlin to mark the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan, a multibillion-dollar recovery programme initiated by the US in 1947 that provided humanitarian and economic assistance to millions of Europeans to ease their recovery after the second world war. The plan was named after George Marshall, the man who was then US secretary of state. Buttigieg, who is in charge of implementing and overseeing a large swathe of projects in the US enabled under the $1tn (£800bn) infrastructure bill that passed six months ago, stressed the relevance to the US as well as Ukraine of Marshall’s insistence about the need to create a “virtuous circle” between the economic security of a nation and its political stability based on its capacity to deliver. He said that decades of disinvestment in the US had turned the virtuous cycle into a vicious one, with political institutions that lacked the resources to deliver well losing their legitimacy, leading to an erosion of trust, “which has given credence to those who would undermine those institutions, further diminishing their capacity to deliver”, he said. The infrastructure fund was intended to break that cycle, he added. “If we can deliver as we’re setting out to do … then citizens will see what it means for them. We’ve got all kinds of things that have scrambled up our political and social life right now, including the information environment, the forms of extremism … and shocks like the pandemic, and economic reverberations from the war in Europe. It’s all the more reason for us to focus on delivering for people.” He said that the stakes included not just comfort and convenience, but “perhaps also the credibility of governance itself”. “In the 1930s, another season when democracy was in doubt, and when it had become fashionable in some circles in Washington to point approvingly to the rise in dictators, some would say by way of praise for fascism that Mussolini makes the trains run on time. “This turns out to not be particularly true, by the way … but how revealing it is that this excuse for autocrats comes on the basis of their supposed prowess in providing transportation.” Regarding Ukraine, Buttigieg said he was interested in President Volodymr Zelenskiy’s calls for reconstruction on a cities and regional level, under a plan apparently gaining traction, by which cities and communities across the world would adopt similar communities in Ukraine to their own ones. “Understanding the needs and different capacities of different parts of the country is going to be very important,” Buttigieg said. Asked if his government’s legitimacy over helping to rebuild a country was to be trusted after its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, Buttigieg, who served in the country as an officer in the US Navy Reserve, said: “Part of what we were up against in Afghanistan is just how fundamentally different the society, the values, the governance culture and the economics of that country are … it’s very different in Ukraine … one of the things that unites us to Ukraine are some of those core values around democracy. “It’s so early to know what will be at the end of this upheaval. What we know is that the kind of united approach we have that reflects shared values among our partners and with Ukrainians is a very powerful one and will be an important basis of the relationship. “Not just in getting us through this war, whatever the endgame looks like, but in a reconstruction that really does hold the promise of leading to new and innovative things.” He praised the leadership he said Germany had shown since the start of the invasion, contrasting with the criticism the government of Olaf Scholz has received. “I think it’s understood in Washington that the new steps that Germany has taken are major steps in security and energy policy … none of us knows what lies on the other side of this Zeitenwende,” he said, adopting the phrase used by Scholz meaning “turning point”, “but all of us should recognise that the only way for it to lead to a good place is for us to find our way to it together.” Earlier on Thursday, Buttigieg took a tour of Berlin’s Hauptbahnhof or central station, a symbol of German unification, and met a group of Germans and US citizens of Ukrainian origin working as volunteers to receive refugees, about 2,000 of whom are arriving on trains from Ukraine each day. “Just make sure you help us by keeping the narrative alive back home,” one of the volunteers, Natalia, from Minnesota and of Ukrainian descent, told him as Buttigieg thanked the women for their work. Buttigieg, who ran for the US presidency in 2020 but withdrew in favour of supporting Joe Biden, would not be drawn on whether he had plans to run again in 2024. “Right now my ambitions are to be the best secretary of transportation that I can,” he said. “I think there’s never been a better time to have this job.” • This article was amended on 23 May 2022. It is the 75th anniversary of the Marshall plan’s initiation, not the 50th as stated in an earlier version. The headline was amended on 24 May 2022 to better reflect that Pete Buttigieg had called for a new Marshall plan for Ukraine, rather than this being decided US policy as an earlier version may have implied.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hundreds of Ukrainian troops evacuated from Mariupol steelworks after 82-day assault ,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/hundreds-of-ukrainian-troops-evacuated-from-azovstal-steelworks-after-82-day-assault,2022-05-17T03:25:13Z,"Blow for Ukraine as removal of soldiers, many wounded, suggests city that became symbol of resistance has fallen into Russian hands","More than 260 Ukrainian soldiers, many of them wounded, have been evacuated from the besieged Azovstal steel plant in the port city of Mariupol, appearing to cede control of the city to Russia after 82 days of bombardment. Ukraine’s deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said late on Monday that 53 heavily wounded soldiers were evacuated to a hospital in the Russian-controlled town of Novoazovsk. More than 200 others were transported through a corridor to Olenivka, Maliar said. The General Staff of Ukraine’s Armed Forces said that the soldiers defending the steel plant had “performed their combat task” and now the main goal was to save the lives of personnel. By holding the steelworks, they stopped Russian forces from rapidly capturing the southern city of Zaporizhzhia, its statement on Facebook said. It was unclear how many soldiers remained in the steel plant, but Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said: “We hope to save the lives of our boys”. “I want to underline: Ukraine needs its Ukrainian heroes alive. This is our principle,” he said in a video statement. The evacuation is likely to mark the end of the longest and bloodiest battle of the Ukraine war and a significant defeat for Ukraine. Mariupol is now in ruins after a Russian siege that Ukraine says killed tens of thousands of people in the city. For Ukrainians, the Azovstal plant has become a symbol of resistance, with hundreds of troops continuing to fight on there even after the rest of the city had fallen to Russian forces. Some 600 troops were believed to have been inside the steel plant. The Azov regiment said it was fulfilling orders to save the lives of its troops. The regiment, which has in the past had nationalist far-right affiliations, was a militia formed to fight the Russians after the invasion of Ukraine in 2014 but has become a unit of the Ukrainian national guard. It said its troops in Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov in the south-east, had held out for 82 days, buying time for the rest of Ukraine to battle Russian forces and secure western arms needed to withstand Moscow’s assault. Hours before the evacuation, Russia said it had reached an agreement to remove the wounded soldiers. “A humanitarian corridor has been opened through which wounded Ukrainian servicemen are being taken to a medical facility in Novoazovsk,” Russia’s defence ministry said. Azovstal’s last defenders had been holding out in bunkers and tunnels built deep underground to withstand nuclear war. Civilians were evacuated from inside the plant, one of the largest metallurgical facilities in Europe, earlier this month. The wife of an Azov regiment member described conditions at the plant earlier on Monday: “They are in hell. They receive new wounds every day. They are without legs or arms, exhausted, without medicines,” Natalia Zaritskaya said. As the Azov evacuations were under way, fighting continued on frontlines across Ukraine. In eastern Ukraine, the focus of Russia’s military campaign, nine civilians were killed in attacks on Donetsk, the region’s governor said. A series of explosion also struck the western Ukraine city of Lviv, with reports of about 10 blasts in quick succession. Ukraine said troops defending its second-largest city, Kharkiv, had repelled Russian forces and advanced as far as the border with Russia. The reports could not be immediately verified. With Moscow showing no sign of relenting nearly three months into its invasion, Finland and Sweden were poised to give up decades of military non-alignment by joining the Nato military alliance. The move faces resistance from Turkey, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan confirming his country’s intention to block the applications, accusing Finland and Sweden of harbouring terror groups, including outlawed Kurdish militants. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Hirokazu Matsuno, said on Tuesday it respected Sweden’s “serious decision” to apply for Nato membership as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was an issue affecting not only Europe but also the Indo-Pacific region. Russian president Vladimir Putin said that while Finnish and Swedish membership of Nato posed “no direct threat for us”, he warned “the expansion of military infrastructure to these territories will certainly provoke our response”. In other developments: The US Air Force said on Monday it had successfully tested a hypersonic weapon on Saturday off the Californian coast. The US has previously tested a hypersonic missile in March but did not disclose it until later, reportedly over concerns it may inflame tensions with Russia. Russia has fired hypersonic missiles at targets in Ukraine. Their speed and manoeuvrability make them difficult to track and intercept.

"‘Cash, coal, cars and trees’: what progress has been made since Cop26?",https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/14/cash-coal-cars-and-trees-what-progress-has-been-made-since-cop26,2022-05-14T06:00:04Z,"Six months on, the war in Ukraine and ongoing Covid-19 pandemic have derailed some changes agreed on in Glasgow","In the run-up to Cop26, the UK government used the mantra “Cash, coal, cars and trees to keep the world to 1.5C” to highlight four key areas on which the conference would focus. Cash At Cop26, rich countries were supposed to fulfil a longstanding promise, made in 2009, to provide $100bn a year in climate finance to the developing world from 2020. The actual amounts provided are still falling short, but developed countries did produce evidence that they would meet the promise this year or next, with the five-year average from 2020 to 2025 at around $100bn. Developing countries have also been promised a new financial settlement that would see greater flows from 2025, with details yet to be decided. In the months since, however, there has been little advance on the Cop26 promises of cash. Rachel Kyte and Lord Stern, both former top World Bank officials, told the Guardian of several concerns over the World Bank’s programmes on climate. Stern said the bank’s resources would be stretched by the additional strains of high energy and food prices around the world, and the effects of the war in Ukraine. Kyte cast doubt on whether the World Bank was truly committed to the climate fight: “[The World Bank’s] weak showing at Glasgow and continued questions about their appetite for urgent action has meant that coalitions form without them at the helm. Broader questions of whether the Bretton Woods institutions are fit for purpose for the climate crisis grow.” The private sector has also come under closer scrutiny. The GFANZ network – the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero – was announced with fanfare by Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England and UN climate envoy. It is unclear, however, how much of that is flowing to the poorest countries that need it most. There are also questions, raised by the Guardian’s carbon bubble investigation, over whether investors are pouring more money into fossil fuels, now enjoying a bonanza, rather than clean tech. There is little in the GFANZ rules to stop them. Carney said it was the job of governments to regulate and provide incentives that would encourage capital into the right directions: “Finance will not drive the net-zero transition on its own. Finance is an enabler, a catalyst that will speed what governments and companies initiate. If there is commitment to move to a sustainable, resilient and fair energy system, and the right policies are made, finance will be there.” Coal Coal was a clear focus of Cop26, though some of the successes the UK initially trumpeted for commitments to phase out coal turned out to be less solid than claimed. In the closing moments of the talks, coal also became a flashpoint as China and India refused to sign up to a “phase-out” of coal, and insisted on changing the term to “phase-down”. Since then, new evidence has emerged of coal expansion as recovery from Covid has quickened, and the war in Ukraine has spurred some countries to consider a return to coal, or a delay to its phasing out. Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), said coal must be at the forefront of Cop27: “The biggest risk is the growing appetite for infrastructure investments in coal. If we are not able to slow that down or stop it, we may lock in our future … If I had to pick one issue [for Cop27], that would be the one.” Cars Electric vehicle sales doubled in key markets last year, as manufacturers ramped up production and consumers embraced new models. But the future of the market this year is looking more uncertain; the war in Ukraine has disrupted key supply chains, and Volkswagen in Germany said earlier this month that it had sold out of electric vehicles for this year for its EU and US markets. Other manufacturers are also struggling with rising costs and looking for alternative sources for components. Many green campaigners are also concerned that talking about cars is the wrong focus – they say we should be talking about transport. Investment in public transport, making it cheaper or even free, is one of the quickest ways to bring down demand for oil, according to the IEA. Trees The UK made action on forests a key focus at Cop26, with a gathering of world leaders to discuss forests and land use and a separate two-day programme of events. A deal to halt global deforestation, signed by China, the US and Brazil among other nations, was the first big “win” of the Glasgow fortnight. But in the past months, Brazil’s deforestation rate in the Amazon has soared to devastating record levels, and a report on the Congo – one of the world’s most important remaining rainforests – has cast doubt on the government’s willingness to take the action needed to halt logging and destruction. Meanwhile, another key forestry meeting this year – the Convention on Biological Diversity (meant to be held in Kunming, China, in 2020, but delayed) – is now in limbo due to the Chinese government’s response to the resurgence of Covid-19. Whether or when the conference will take place at all is now unknown. Lord Goldsmith, the UK minister in charge of the Cop26 forestry efforts, has been on a frantic round of diplomacy this year to shore up the forest deal. He said the UK wanted world leaders to meet every year to discuss progress. “The contribution of forestry to the overall global emissions reductions needed is potentially huge. It could contribute about 10%-15% to the global emissions target.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The cold logic behind Russia’s crude, nihilistic tactics in Ukraine | Jack Watling",https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/may/26/russia-crude-tactics-ukraine-bombardment-kyiv,2022-05-26T11:35:23Z,"Constant bombardment threatens to produce a stalemate that would cost Kyiv dear economically and politically, says Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute","Russia’s offensive in the Donbas region is making slow progress. Having rushed to launch the operation to avoid giving Ukraine time to bring up new weapons from the west, Russia has found that its depleted and exhausted units are unwilling and unable to assault Ukrainian positions without incurring unacceptable losses. The Russian army has, therefore, fallen back on the mass application of artillery, destroying village after village, which they occupy after Ukrainian units withdraw. For the Ukrainian military, the current Russian tactics may be unsophisticated and nihilistic, but they are also dangerous. To stop the Russians from advancing, the Ukrainian armed forces must occupy the ground. This subjects their units to heavy bombardment, and is producing a steady accumulation of Ukrainian casualties. The Ukrainians are trying to limit the weight of Russian fire by raiding and striking the logistics supporting the Russian artillery. The challenge for the Russian military is maintaining troop levels. Moscow has begun an unannounced mobilisation of citizens with former military service, complementing a recruitment drive for volunteers to take up short-term service contracts. The short-term contracts are intended to keep up the strength of units until mobilised personnel are organised and equipped. But with little training, low morale, poor unit cohesion following significant casualties and a steady influx of new personnel, Russian units continue to perform badly and suffer disproportionately in engagements. Although the short-term military trends currently favour Ukraine, the country faces hard choices. So long as Russia has a significant number of artillery systems and its air defences deny Ukraine air support, the Ukrainian military is forced to remain dispersed, limiting its available combat power at any one point and slowing the rate at which it can liberate territory. Ukraine must also guard against the risk that Russia moves into a large and more overt mobilisation of its population that, while politically risky, would threaten a significant offensive late in the year, requiring Ukraine to hold forces in reserve. If the Ukrainian military cannot liberate significant tracts of territory or bleed out the Russian army this summer then there is the risk of a protracted conflict. The principal security concerns for Kyiv are economic and political. Without a peace settlement, Ukraine will remain economically paralysed, its ports blockaded, its cities heavily damaged, and investment or reconstruction deterred by the ever looming prospect of missile strikes. Kyiv is expected to lose almost half of its GDP this year. Many internally displaced Ukrainians have been living off their savings. These will begin to run out. A protracted conflict also risks damaging internal cohesion. Ukraine has so far been politically unified, with Russia’s sympathisers in the Ukrainian state keeping a low profile or enthusiastically supporting the war effort. It would be dangerous to do anything else. As curfews and movement controls are lifted, however, and the political clarity of the need to defend Kyiv dissipates, there are renewed opportunities for subversion. How the government ensures it can provide heating for citizens away from the front as winter approaches, for example, is an issue over which criticism may be justified. But such issues can also be weaponised by Russia to degrade the country’s internal unity. In a protracted conflict, Ukraine will probably depend upon financial assistance from abroad, but it is also likely to need that assistance precisely when its international partners are under the greatest economic strain. Inflation in the UK is approaching 10%. There is a serious risk of recession. If job losses come in the autumn, it will coincide with people’s renewed need to heat their homes. Energy prices, meanwhile, are expected to remain high, and Russia has so far kept supplying Europe. Under these conditions European citizens may become less supportive of aiding Ukraine to fight a grinding war in Donbas when there is acute pain felt at home. Given these dark clouds on the horizon, Ukraine’s partners must pursue two courses of action. First, Ukraine must improve its security position as much as possible over the summer. To do this it requires long-range artillery that can challenge Russia’s fires dominance. The US provision of M777 155mm howitzers is a good start. Ukraine’s partners must also help in training new Ukrainian brigades so that the country can withdraw and reconstitute some of its units. It is also critical that the Russian army not be given the opportunity to recover the initiative. To prevent this, it is important to keep the rate of Russian casualties in Donbas high, so that mobilised personnel have to be immediately pushed into maintaining Russian positions rather than organised into new units able to open up new axes. The second line of effort must be a coordinated approach across Europe to build resilience for this winter and to begin working out the best means of offering economic support to Ukraine. There is also a need to inform the public early and clearly as to the direct correlation between Russia’s actions and the economic pain to come. Russian disinformation will inevitably portray the economic pain as a consequence of supporting Kyiv. Such distortions need to be preemptively undermined. Finally, there is the question of alliance unity. There are growing calls across Nato to consider negotiated solutions, often premised on trading Ukrainian territory for peace. While negotiations should never be abandoned, pushing for a ceasefire that would lock in Russian gains, allow the Russian army to recover and prepare for a renewed offensive and leave Ukraine economically crippled, is deeply naive. It is vital that the disagreements about objectives between key European partners are thrashed out and resolved as soon as possible. As Ukrainian citizens are put through filtration camps, and Russia plots the annexation of more of its territory, it must be understood that peace on Russia’s terms would be a very violent affair.

Maduro glimpses political lifeline as US rethinks Venezuela policy,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/19/venezuela-nicolas-maduro-us-relations,2022-05-19T09:15:15Z,Putin’s war on Ukraine and political deadlock in Caracas have combined to herald a new dawn in US-Venezuela ties,"It was little more than a year ago that US officials were publicly rubbishing the prospect of engagement with Venezuela’s President Nicolás Maduro, who they described as a “dictator”. “His repression, corruption and mismanagement have generated one of the most dire humanitarian crises this hemisphere has seen,” the state department spokesperson, Ned Price, declared in February last year. “We certainly don’t expect any contact with Maduro any time soon.” Yet 2022 appears to have heralded a new dawn for Washington-Caracas ties, as geopolitical shifts caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and political deadlock in the economically devastated South American country prompt a major policy rethink from members of Joe Biden’s administration – and offer Venezuela’s authoritarian leader a once improbable political lifeline. On Tuesday, the US announced a gentle easing of the economic sanctions it has spent years using to push for political change in Venezuela – including against a nephew of its first lady – a move senior members of Maduro’s government celebrated. “Venezuela hopes that these decisions by the United States of America will pave the way to the total lifting of the illegal sanctions which affect our entire people,” the country’s vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, tweeted in English as the news emerged. Simultaneously, her brother, another top Chavista called Jorge Rodríguez, shared a photograph of himself shaking hands with the chief negotiator for Venezuela’s opposition, Gerardo Blyde, signalling the reactivation of stalled talks designed to bridge the country’s toxic political schism. “Congratulations!” tweeted Marcelo Ebrard, the foreign minister of Mexico, where those negotiations were happening until their suspension last October after the extradition of the Maduro ally Alex Saab to the US. Some see Washington’s change of heart as a direct consequence of Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine. In March, days after Russia’s onslaught began, senior US officials flew to Caracas for their first encounter with Maduro representatives in years. That visit was partly motivated by a US desire to increase oil production in Venezuela – which boasts the world’s largest proven reserves – in order to restrain global oil prices, which have soared as a result of Putin’s war. Christopher Sabatini, a Chatham House Latin America expert, said the war in Ukraine had also prompted a rethink in Caracas, which desperately needed new markets for its oil as well as access to western refineries, banking systems and investment. “It’s true that oil prices have gone up with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine but, because of sanctions, Russia is now increasing the sale of its oil to China, which was Venezuela’s principal market,” he added. Yet Sabatini believed Washington’s shift had been planned well before Putin’s invasion and reflected the US’s realization that the Trump-era “maximum pressure” policy – by which harsh sanctions were used to try to topple Maduro and replace him with the young opposition leader Juan Guaidó – had failed. “It is a demonstration that the US and much of the international community bet on a solution that simply hasn’t worked,” Sabatini said. “That’s anathema to some people in the US Congress. It’s anathema to some elements of the Venezuelan opposition who always hoped and dreamed for some sort of cathartic collapse of the government and the fleeing of Maduro and his cronies. But clearly Maduro has hung on, [albeit] at a huge cost to his country … and now the US has to [engage].” Representatives of Venezuela’s mainstream opposition, and the rival government Guaidó created when his campaign to unseat Maduro started in January 2019, now accept dealing with their foe is the only way forwards as the country heads towards its next scheduled presidential election in 2024. Speaking to the Guardian during a recent tour of Europe, Guaidó’s deputy foreign minister, Isadora Zubillaga, admitted: “The reality is that we must talk. We were not able to wipe them out and they were not able to wipe us out either. That negotiation process must include discussion of the lifting of sanctions and penalties.” However, Zubillaga warned the west against boosting what she called a Putin-led autocratic coalition by offering too many concessions to Maduro. “The Maduro regime is sustained by the international alliance, including countries like Iran, Russia, Cuba and China. If Maduro is helped, so is Putin,” Zubillaga said. A senior US administration official said that it would calibrate its sanctions policy depending on the behaviour of Maduro’s administration and whether “ambitious, concrete and irreversible” steps towards free and democratic elections were achieved at talks. Members of the US right denounced the loosening of sanctions, which include allowing limited contact between the US oil giant Chevron and Venezuela’s government. “Biden continues his effort to appease anti-American communist dictators,” tweeted the Republican senator Marco Rubio, one of the cheerleaders for Trump’s bungled anti-Maduro drive. A Wall Street Journal editorial condemned Biden’s “dance with a Latin dictator”. Others expressed cautious optimism that, while there would be no overnight solutions to Venezuela’s profound economic, humanitarian and political crises, the return of negotiations – and incentives for Maduro and others around him to offer concessions – was a step towards a democratic transition. Geoff Ramsey, the director for Venezuela at the Washington Office on Latin America, said: “The only feasible transition is a pacted transition which is going to require some level of negotiations with political, military and economic elites. “What we are seeing is a recognition of that reality. I don’t think that means that the US or other actors of the international community are ignorant or naive about the difficulties that lie ahead,” he added. “If the problem in Venezuela were simply a lack of dialogue we would have seen the crisis solved years ago.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
‘I’m never going back’: the high-profile Russian defectors rejecting war,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/25/im-never-going-back-the-high-profile-russian-defectors-rejecting-war,2022-05-25T04:00:26Z,Gazprombank’s Igor Volobuyev and diplomat Boris Bondarev are among the Russian elite to oppose Putin’s invasion of Ukraine,"Igor Volobuyev spent two decades working in the heart of the Russian business establishment, first for Gazprom and then for its affiliate Gazprombank, where until February this year he was vice-president. Then Vladimir Putin launched his war on Ukraine in late February, and Volobuyev decided he could no longer stand living in Russia. He packed a small rucksack of possessions and a stack of cash, and flew out of the country on 2 March, pretending he was going on holiday. A few days later, he crossed from Poland into Ukraine, where he spent his childhood years. Now, he spends his days trying to convince officials to provide him with Ukrainian documents and allow him to sign up for military service. “I want to go to the place where I can defend my homeland with a weapon, I’m trying every day,” he said, in an interview in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv. “I am never going back to Russia.” Hundreds of thousands of Russians are believed to have fled the country since Putin launched the war, and many intellectuals, journalists and activists have voiced their opposition to the conflict. However, among the political and business elites, defections have been extremely rare. Despite reports of widespread dismay over the invasion of Ukraine, only a tiny handful of people have spoken publicly to condemn the war. On Monday, Boris Bondarev, a career diplomat posted to the Russian mission to the UN in Geneva, became the highest-level Russian diplomat to denounce the war. When he resigned, Bondarev published a scathing letter in which he wrote that he was “ashamed” of his country and called the invasion a “disaster”. Bondarev said he made his mind up to resign on the day Russia launched its invasion, but it took months to gather the resolve to go public. Like many fellow diplomats, Bondarev had remained in his post over the past decade, despite Russia’s growing isolation due to a series of crises, including its annexation of Crimea and the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 in 2014. “You understand that it is wrong,” he said in a telephone interview. “That it’s not good. But it doesn’t really touch you, your life. These bad things they happen somewhere far away. It’s not right but that’s how most people think.” “But now this is totally different: Russia attacked another country. This is Ukraine who we always considered to be our brothers and attacked them in the most brutal manner. Bombing cities. Claiming them to be Nazis and denazified. It’s something ridiculous. It’s something unimaginable.” Bondarev said he believed many of his fellow diplomats were also opposed to the war, but he never discussed it with them. “It isn’t something you really talked about with other people, it isn’t something you can speak about openly these days,” Bondarev said. “Everyone is silent.” Volobuyev said that after 2014, he had started to speak openly about his concerns over Russian politics in the workplace, and while many people were scared of getting involved in a discussion, he felt that most people he knew agreed at least partially. “In Gazprom there were a few passionate Putinists, but the majority of people understood exactly what kind of country they lived in. A lot of people in Russia are just scared,” he said. “You have this internal censorship, that it’s dangerous to say certain things, and you live with this permanently. Ukrainians look at this and they don’t understand it because they are a free people,” he said. Volobuyev grew up in the Ukrainian city of Okhtyrka , and left for Moscow in 1989, when he was 18. After spending some time in journalism, he joined Gazprom, where he worked for 15 years before moving to become one of Gazprombank’s vice-presidents in 2015. As he tells it, he was originally a supporter of Putin, and voted for him in 2012, but his “eyes were opened” by the Maidan revolution in 2014 and subsequent Russia-backed war in Donbas. He wanted to return to Ukraine then, but said he could not, for family reasons, about which he declined to elaborate. “It was a choice between my homeland and my family, and at that time I chose my family. On 24 February this year, I understood I could not put it off any longer,” he said. Volobuyev was a mid-ranking cog in the Gazprom machine; among the higher business echelons few people have dared to break ranks. Oleg Tinkov, a self-made billionaire who set up one of Russia’s leading banks, has so far been the most outspoken public opponent of the war among the business elite. In one of a series of critical Instagram posts, Tinkov wrote: “I don’t see ANY beneficiary of this crazy war! Innocent people and soldiers are dying.” After his statements, Tinkov said he was forced to sell his assets at a knockdown price to an oligarch loyal to the Kremlin. In an interview with the Russian journalist Yury Dud, he said he was sure that the entire business elite backed his statements but were too scared to say the same publicly. “I have spoken to 12 of the top 20 on the Forbes list personally, and they all support me, there is a full consensus,” he said. He said half of those he had spoken to justified their silence by claiming to fear for their tens of thousands of employees, who could be affected if they fell out of favour with the Kremlin. “The other half say, ‘We’ll make a statement and then lose our business, like you, and then what, what have you achieved?’” Putin has referred to those who oppose Moscow’s actions as “scum and traitors”, whom the Russian people will “spit out like a fly”. In the current climate it is clear that public opposition to the war makes it dangerous to return to Russia. Bondarev said he was worried about the response to his statement and said he would “welcome” an offer of asylum in the west. Tinkov has said he has hired bodyguards. As a Russian citizen of Ukrainian origin, Volobuyev’s position is a little different. His arrival in Ukraine has given him a feeling that he has finally returned home, he said. But he accepts that he has a lot of work to do to persuade Ukrainians of his sincerity. “All these years, I said I was Ukrainian but I continued to live and work there. I understand that I have to repent, and to prove for many years that I should be allowed to live here and that I can be trusted,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Is Putin involved in strategic battlefield decisions in Ukraine invasion?,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/17/is-putin-involved-in-strategic-battlefield-decisions-in-ukraine-invasion,2022-05-17T17:18:56Z,Analysis: western military planners believe Russian president is operating at ‘level of a colonel or brigadier’ amid push into Donbas,"It is Vladimir Putin’s war – or least that’s how the west characterises it. Not only was the decision to invade Ukraine made by the Russian president, but western military officials now say Putin is engaged in battlefield decision making “at the level of a colonel or brigadier” as the Donbas offensive in eastern Ukraine unfolds. In part, the observation is not very surprising. Any idea that the Russian president – as commander in chief – would not be involved in the battle plans, particularly once the war in Ukraine started going badly, would be impossible to believe. Autocratic regimes tend not to favour military decentralisation. But it also comes at a point of embarrassing military failure. An attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces last week resulted in nearly 500 killed and the loss of over 70 armoured vehicles in a disastrous attempt to cross the Siverski Donets river, which took place, western sources said, not under the cover of darkness but in broad daylight . So if the western claim is to be believed, Putin would have approved the battle plan. Decision making at the “level of a colonel or brigadier” implies a brigade level command of two or more battalions, the movement of 1,500 or more troops: precisely the kind of force that tried and failed to ford the strategic river. Prof Sir Lawrence Freedman from King’s College London, said he judged the military statement about Putin’s level of involvement to be plausible: “Putin has chased the military operation, first by giving very little notice he would launch an attack and then pushing hard for quick wins. That’s particularly been the problem with the second stage of the war, in the Donbas.” Yet claims about Putin goes further still. It brings to mind the idea of a political leader impatient of, or no longer trusting their generals – most notably the downfall of Adolf Hitler, who in the latter stages of the second world war, as described by biographer Ian Kershaw, refused to heed his generals’ calls for tactical retreats in the east and insisted instead upon overoptimistic counteroffensives, as in the Ardennes in the winter of 1944/5. But there are no shortage of other examples. In the early stages of the Vietnam war, US president Lyndon Johnson and his administration began a bombing campaign aimed at communist North Vietnam in 1965 called Rolling Thunder, which defined the targets that could be attacked to avoid offending China or Soviet Russia. The confused strategy was an attempt to break the resolve of Hanoi by bombing lesser targets from the air, and a step in an escalating war that the US would ultimately lose. In the run up to the final Iraq war, the country’s dictator Saddam Hussein decided that the country’s air force should play no part in the war, with its planes “in palm groves or buried them in the sand” according to an account in Foreign Affairs written three years after the war. The belief was the Iraqi air force would be no match for the western invaders – and that it was best saved for a post war future under his leadership that never transpired after the capture of Baghdad. But despite all the stories of meddling, the relationship between political leadership and military command has always been complex and at times fraught. Freedman, also the author of a soon to be published book on the subject called Command, says military decisions during war time are “intensely political” and that it is up to political leaderships to “set objectives, push senior commanders, ask questions”. The goal, Freedman argues, is to ensure there is “a dialogue between politicians and the military” and to that leaders are not overruling legitimate objections or trying to micromanage the battle-plans at a time when they should be concentrating on wider diplomatic or political strategies. For Putin, as the war in Ukraine approaches its twelfth week, the question arises whether the Russian leader has the time to focus on all that is before him if he is embroiled in tactical decision making in a Donbas offensive that is stalling – and the impact that further military failures would have on his standing. In the past few days some Russian military bloggers and experts have begun to question the strategy. One popular Russian blogger who uses the pseudonym Vladlen Tatarzky on his Telegram channel wrote: “Until we know the name of the ‘military genius’ who put a battalion tactical group by the river and he doesn’t answer for it publicly, then there will never be reforms in the army.” It turns out the writer might have been criticising Putin himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Revealed: EU plans loans and grants to help rebuild Ukraine,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/16/revealed-eu-plans-loans-and-grants-to-help-rebuild-ukraine,2022-05-16T17:20:57Z,Leaked report also suggests assessing feasibility of using assets seized from sanctioned Russians,"Ukraine could receive loans, grants and possibly the proceeds of seized Russian oligarch property to help pay the multibillion-euro cost of rebuilding the country after the ruinous war launched by the Kremlin, according to a leaked EU reconstruction plan. In the plan drafted in Brussels, the European Commission states that the Ukrainian government will have to take out loans to pay for rebuilding its war-ravaged country. Non-repayable grants from EU member states would provide another tranche of the funds needed to rebuild destroyed homes, schools, roads, railways, airports and bridges. The EU also proposes assessing the feasibility of using assets seized from sanctioned Russians and Belarusians after a proposal from the head of the European Council, Charles Michel, earlier this month. “I am absolutely convinced that this is extremely important not only to freeze assets, but also to make possible to confiscate it, to make it available for the rebuilding of the country,” he told Ukraine’s Interfax news agency. Lawmakers in the UK and the US have also proposed seizing Russian property to aid Ukraine’s reconstruction and ease the plight of the country’s refugees. Brussels officials have also called for the EU to borrow as a bloc on international capital markets to finance loans for Kyiv, according to the leaked report. If agreed, it would be only the second time in its history that the EU has borrowed as a whole rather than as individual member states, after funding the landmark €750bn (£635bn) Covid recovery plan in 2020. The idea is floated in a Ukraine relief and reconstruction plan seen by the Guardian that the commission is expected to publish on Wednesday. Figures have been left blank in the document, pending further discussions in Brussels. The paper notes, however, that the financial needs “are expected to be substantial” and that reconstruction would take more than a decade. It also estimates that damage to physical infrastructure alone may run to more than €100bn. To pay the bill, the commission proposes a mix of grants and cheap loans in which EU member states and non-EU countries could make contributions via the bloc’s reconstruction programme. Ukraine will need “significant short-term financial relief” to sustain basic services, provide humanitarian aid and fix essential infrastructure, the EU document states. To meet these urgent needs, the commission proposes loans at low interest rates with long-term repayment deadlines. The US president, Joe Biden, proposed a $33bn (£27bn) aid programme for Ukraine last month, which includes more than $20bn in military spending. The EU has provided €4.1bn in emergency loans and humanitarian aid since the start of Russia’s invasion and agreed to fund weapons and other non-lethal military assistance worth €1.5bn. This does not include the money that individual EU member states have provided. The EU’s reconstruction plan would be jointly led by Brussels and Kyiv, according to the document. Although it does not explicitly mention Ukraine’s hopes of joining the EU, the plan would be intended to bring the aspirant member in line with EU standards, including on the rule of law, anti-corruption, energy and the climate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Kharkiv hit by fresh strikes amid fears city is still on Russian agenda,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/kharkiv-hit-by-fresh-strikes-amid-fears-city-is-still-on-russian-agenda,2022-05-27T01:00:01Z,Life had begun to return to normal in Ukraine’s second city after Moscow’s troops were forced to retreat,"Artillery has pounded the city of Kharkiv for the first time in two weeks, just as life in Ukraine’s second city was starting to return to normal after Russian troops were pushed back from its outlying towns and villages. Kharkiv’s regional governor, Oleh Synehubov, said at least nine people had been killed and 17 injured in the attacks on the northern part of the city. “There’s no logic to it, it’s just terror against the local population, to sow panic and to destroy critical infrastructure,” said Synehubov, dressed in military fatigues with a pistol at his hip, in an interview with the Guardian in central Kharkiv shortly after the attacks. The largely Russian-speaking city near the border of the two countries was heavily attacked during the first days of the war as Russian forces tried to take control, but they were pushed back to the suburbs. The Russians sent artillery and missiles into the city, on one occasion destroying the regional administration building, housed in a grand Stalin-era structure. The Russians have been pushed further back over the last six weeks as Ukrainian forces regained control of several towns and villages, but they remain well within artillery range of the city centre. “For two weeks it’s been relatively quiet … I think this is them saying hello, telling us they are still there, trying to create panic,” Synehubov said. The booms of incoming and outgoing artillery fire were audible throughout Thursday, shaking buildings and setting off car alarms in central Kharkiv. In the afternoon, a deep shell crater was left on Otakara Yarosha Street in front of a block of flats from which the windows on all five floors had been blown out. Police at the scene said they did not know how many people had died there. Outside the 23 August metro station, a blast had brought down large branches from several trees, and dead pigeons and tangled electricity cables lay scattered across a wide expanse of concrete. Shrapnel had torn holes in a nearby second world war monument. It was not immediately obvious whether people had died at the scene, and there were few people around to ask, as air raid sirens and the booms of artillery sounded. A steady flow of residents had started to return to their homes in the city. A few cafes and restaurants had opened, people were strolling in city parks on Thursday morning and this week, and the metro began operating again for the first time since the invasion. In recent weeks, its main use has been as a bomb shelter, with thousands living on its underground platforms. The city mayor, Ihor Terekhov, told residents: “We will not stop the metro, but we will allocate special sectors where you can stay and shelter from bombing.” After Russia failed in its assaults on Kyiv and Kharkiv in the early days of the war, Moscow has concentrated much of its efforts on a bloody offensive to take more territory in the Donbas region. But Thursday’s attacks raised fears that Kharkiv could still be on the agenda. “The Russian troops are engaged in a counter-offensive, and are trying to reoccupy territories that were liberated by our troops just a month ago,” said Oleksandr Filchakov, Kharkiv region’s chief prosecutor, in an interview with the Guardian. He said he believed the ultimate aim was to launch a renewed assault on the city itself. Filchakov also noted reports that Russian troops were unloading Iskander missiles at the railway station in Belgorod, just across the border. For now, said Synehubov, a renewed ground assault on the city was not possible. “They are firing from the positions they have held for a long time; they are constantly trying to counterattack but our forces are holding their positions.” He said there was not a significant enough buildup of new troops and equipment on the other side of the border to signal the capacity for a new assault on the city. “But that’s right now, and the situation can change at any minute,” he added. However, Synehubov said, the main problem for the Kharkiv region, unlike others, was that the Russians continued to shell settlements after they had retreated. “In Kyiv, Sumy, Chernihiv regions, the Russians fought for a certain period, realised they had hit a wall and then took the decision to retreat, and they retreated fully from these territories,” he said. “Here, even if we liberate a place, then the enemy stays in its positions and keeps hitting it, and we can’t properly evacuate people, we can’t bring humanitarian aid, because these places are under permanent fire. We can’t bring in de-mining teams because of the shelling, so we need to push the enemy back even further so they would focus on our positions and not on population centres,” he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Bravo! Music at reopened Kyiv opera replaces noise of Russian artillery,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/21/bravo-reopened-kyiv-opera-drowns-out-russian-artillery,2022-05-21T18:43:26Z,"Three months after the invasion, the capital’s grand old venue stages an emotional comeback","The lights dimmed, a hush came over the auditorium and the orchestra struck up the first notes of the overture. This ritual has taken place thousands of times at Kyiv’s grand opera house over the past century, but the performance on Saturday afternoon was something out of the ordinary. In a city that over the past three months became used to wailing air-raid sirens and the thuds of artillery from the suburbs, the audience was instead treated to the frothy melodies of Rossini’s The Barber of Seville. It marked the first performance since the missiles and shells of Vladimir Putin’s invasion rudely interrupted the opera season – and everything else in Ukraine – in the early hours of 24 February. Now, less than three months later and with fierce battles still raging in the eastern part of the country, the opera is back, although with some changes. Performances will only take place on weekend afternoons, a maximum of 300 tickets are sold, and the audience has to be ready to move quickly to the basement cloakrooms if air-raid sirens sound during a performance. Saturday’s audience was a mix of couples enjoying their first opportunity for weeks to wear their most elegant outfits, and soldiers in military fatigues taking a break from their army service for some high culture. Only the stalls were full, with the four tiers of gilded balconies off-limits to ensure an evacuation could take place more quickly if needed. “I can’t say opera is my usual entertainment, but it is an incredible feeling to hear this music and to be in a different world for a little while, before coming back to our reality,” said Volodymyr, a soldier who only wanted to give his first name. Many of the opera troupe are still abroad, and some in the orchestra are fighting on the frontline or serving in the territorial defence forces. Oleksii Potiomkin, the principal dancer of the ballet, has joined up and is serving in the army, posting daily updates on Instagram. But enough artists and technical staff are back at work for the company to put on full-scale opera stagings. Soprano Olha Fomichova, who sang the lead role of Rosina on Saturday, struggled to hold back tears as she spoke of her emotions before going on stage. “I had the feeling this morning that I was coming to sing a premiere, even though I have been singing this role for years. I feel like I’m coming out on to this stage, which I know so well, for the first time,” she said. Fomichova mostly stayed in Kyiv during the invasion but sent her son to safety in Germany. She saw him recently when she travelled there to take part in a charity gala to help Ukraine, and both the family reunion and the concert were emotional, she said. “When you take a Ukrainian flag on to the stage for the curtain call and you are met with a 10-minute standing ovation, I don’t have words to describe the feeling,” she said. Over the past three months, the soloists have kept in touch in a chat group on Viber, swapping stories about how the war was going for them, said Natalia Nykolaishyn, a soprano who has been at the theatre for 20 years. “We were all very close before, but now we feel like family,” she said. On Sunday, Nykolaishyn will sing the lead role in the opera Natalka Poltavka by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko. “We wanted to open with symbolic performances: first a European classic and then a Ukrainian classic,” said culture minister Oleksandr Tkachenko, who attended Saturday’s performance. Kyiv’s opera house has seen a lot over the years, on and off the stage. Opened in 1901 after a fire destroyed the previous building, a decade later it was the scene of a dramatic assassination. Prime minister Pyotr Stolypin, attending a Rimsky-Korsakov opera with Tsar Nicholas II, was shot dead during the interval while standing in the front row of the stalls. The pause in performances during the Russian invasion is only the third lengthy gap in activity over the past century, said the theatre’s archivist Larisa Tarasenko. The first was between the end of the Nazi occupation and the return of the evacuated Soviet troupe. The second was due to Covid. Otherwise, performances continued even as regimes, empires and ideological slants changed. Now, with the Russian invasion, the theatre plans to remove all of its Russian repertoire, at least for the time being. Tkachenko said the culture ministry is actively lobbying opera houses abroad to remove Russian works from their repertoires, an issue which has stirred a debate in many countries over whether Russia’s cultural heritage should be separate from the actions of Putin’s government. “We’re trying to argue that in a time of war, it is a symbolic move, and we should find ways to celebrate French, Italian and certainly Ukrainian composers,” said Tkachenko. Nykolaishyn said she grew up on the Russian classics, and singing Tatyana in Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin was one of her first and favourite soloist roles. “But right now, this is not the time for anything Russian. Maybe one day it will be possible again, I don’t know,” she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine farming group calls for urgent end to ports blockade,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/may/17/ukraine-farming-group-warns-of-cascade-of-export-bans-without-new-grain-routes,2022-05-17T18:16:59Z,"Group warns of ‘cascade of export bans’ amid failure to ease grain bottlenecks fuelling shortages and inflation, MHP said","One of Ukraine’s largest farming groups has called for an urgent solution to unblock the country’s Black Sea ports as exports of grain, sunflower and rapeseed are being held up by the Russian naval blockade, driving inflation and shortages around the world. G7 ministers have held urgent talks about trying to open routes through Romanian and Baltic ports, potentially fed with an army of 10,000 trucks making a five-day trip from Ukraine. John Rich, the chairman of MHP, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said: “If we had a UN agreement in place it would solve an enormous amount of issues.” But he said that without the war ending such a deal was unlikely, piling pressure on prices for grain and seeds used for cooking oil and ethanol around the world into next year. “We are now in a vicious cycle,” Rich said. “Normally what happens is that farmers cure high prices as [when prices go up] farmers produce more and prices collapse. This time it could be different,” Rich said pointing to a combination of climate change, the Covid pandemic, the war in Ukraine, as well as fertiliser shortages which are hitting production around the world. He said the world could be looking at a “cascade of export bans”, following India’s block on the export of wheat and Indonesia’s block on palm oil exports, raising the prospect that “the whole concept of globalisation in food production is dead”. Exports from Ukraine, which produces as much as half the world’s sunflower seeds, a tenth of wheat and up to a fifth of barley and rapeseed, have been severely interrupted by the closure of Ukraine’s ports following Russia’s invasion. Only about 1m tonnes of grain and seed were exported in April compared with more than 5m tonnes of grain and 700,000 tonnes of oilseeds a month in a typical year. Before the war, about 80% of Ukraine’s grain and oilseeds were exported via the Black Sea but that route is now cut off, creating a bottleneck as farmers prepare to harvest the summer crops. Efforts are being made to increase the pace of exports, by increasing the use of trucks and improving rail capacity and links, which are hampered by differing track gauges in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. However, Rich said road and rail could replace little more than a quarter of the capacity that once flowed through Ukraine’s ports and would take time to develop. He said MHP was fairly confident its own crops could be sent out via truck and train to ports in Poland and Lithuania, and the company was processing more sunflower seeds into oil within Ukraine, for example, to help lower transport and storage costs. The blockade means grain silos are full and farmers are struggling to find storage for the summer crops. Without a solution, he said that many would be reluctant to plant for the winter. “There is going to be a lot of soul searching when it comes to winter 2022 and it is going to be all about logistics and storage,” he said. “We are in a real dilemma at present,” he said. “There is a huge bottleneck and it is not easily solved, certainly not in the next six or eight weeks. Unless the Russian fleet is sunk, I don’t see a solution. I can’t see any solution to this in a very, very long time.” Production of wheat, sunflower oil and other crops in Ukraine is expected to be down by about 35% this year as planting and harvests in east of the country have been affected by fighting. Rich said production in the rest of the country was good with “growing conditions excellent” and MHP’s farms had been able to secure enough fertiliser and other inputs. “We are in good shape, the season so far is going well,” he said, although the long range forecast for the region is that it will be unusually hot this year. But he said production could be lower as it was not clear how many small and medium-sized farms had been affected by shortages and price rises on diesel and fertiliser as well a concerns on storage.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
UK expands import sanctions against Russia and Belarus,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/08/uk-expands-import-sanctions-against-russia-and-belarus,2022-05-08T21:30:12Z,Latest £1.7bn sanctions include UK import tariffs on metals and chemicals,"The UK government has expanded its sanctions against Russia to include punitive import tariffs on Russian precious metals, as well as export bans on certain UK products, to increase economic pressure on Moscow over the invasion of Ukraine. The third wave of sanctions was announced by the Department for International Trade just hours ahead of Russia’s 9 May Victory Day celebrations, when the country celebrates the end of the second world war with military parades and when President Vladimir Putin is expected to repackage details of the war in Ukraine to citizens. The latest £1.7bn sanctions on Russia and neighbouring Belarus – which has joined in the invasion of Ukraine and been used as a base for Russian soldiers – are aimed at knocking Putin’s ability to fund his war. The announcement came shortly after G7 leaders, including Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden, held a video call with Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in a show of unity with the country ahead of the Kremlin’s Victory Day parades. The new package of restrictions includes £1.4bn of UK import tariffs – border taxes paid by buyers on goods shipped from Russia – that will affect imports of platinum, palladium and other products including chemicals from Russia. The international trade department said Russia was highly dependent on the UK for exports of the precious metals, which will be subject to additional 35 percentage point tariffs. The government will also ban the export of more than £250m of goods in sectors where the Russian economy is most dependent on UK products, including key materials like chemicals, plastics, rubber and machinery. The latest measures, announced by the international trade secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, bring the total value of products subject to full or partial trade sanctions since Russia’s invasion to more than £4bn. Previous rounds of measures have targeted the energy sector, and have also included an asset freeze on Russia’s largest bank, and sanctions against people and organisations principally involved with information and media. Trevelyan said: “This far-reaching package of sanctions will inflict further damage on the Russian war machine. “It is part of a wider coordinated effort by the many countries around the world who are horrified by Russia’s conduct and determined to bring to bear our economic might to persuade Putin to change course.” Sunak said: “Working closely with our allies, we can and will thwart Putin’s ambitions.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukraine refugees staying with UK hosts not cleared by DBS criminal record checks,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2022/may/14/ukraine-refugees-staying-with-uk-hosts-not-cleared-by-criminal-record-checks,2022-05-14T16:00:06Z,Concerns grow for safety of those heading to Britain amid delays to local authority vetting• Russia-Ukraine war: latest developments,"Ukrainians fleeing the war are being housed with UK hosts who have not had a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) criminal record check, in the latest concern to blight the government’s response to the refugee crisis. Under increasing pressure to iron out flaws in its schemes, government sources told the Observer they were creating a “rematching” service to house Ukrainians with people willing to help. Tens of thousands of people who have registered an interest with the UK’s Homes for Ukraine scheme will be contacted to say the government is working with councils and charities to match them with Ukrainians who have arrived in the UK but find themselves homeless after their initial place fell through or family members could not host them. So far, more than 102,000 visas have been issued under the two government refugee schemes for Ukrainians, and 46,100 have arrived in the UK. Before refugees arrive in the UK, their hosts are subject to criminal records checks by the Home Office, which are then followed by DBS checks carried out by local authorities. However, teething problems continue to beset the government’s initiatives. In many cases, people have been housed for weeks by hosts who still are waiting for their DBS checks. Karen Liebreich, from west London, collected her 21-year-old Ukrainian refugee from the airport five weeks ago but said she was still waiting for the results of the checks. She said: “My husband and I have now filled in our forms for the DBS checks, but she has been here for five weeks and we still haven’t been approved.” The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities – which is responsible for the scheme – contacted her last week to ask if it could use her as a case study, but Liebreich refused. In an email to the department, she said: “[Your] department was all over the press assuring us that everyone housing a Ukrainian has had a completed DBS check. As this is a categoric lie ... I’m not prepared to facilitate an interview to bolster a government message for ministers that seem not to understand the value of the truth.” A DBS check allows employers and other organisations to look at the criminal record of someone applying for a role, if they have one. On Thursday another host of a Ukrainian mother and son in Essex also said they had arrived but that she “hadn’t been checked” and had asked the council for an explanation. Another host from Essex wrote on Facebook: “Our guests, including young child, arrived on 14 April and we were only sent the links for the enhanced DBS check last Friday [6 May].” Essex county council said the delays had arisen due to the “volume” of cases but that it was “prioritising those who already have guests with them”, and last week started face-to-face DBS checks at two offices to “speed things up further”. In response to such issues and concerns over homelessness, a parliamentary committee will this week urge the government to sort out its “completely dysfunctional” schemes. Clive Betts, chair of the levelling-up committee, said he had written to refugees minister Richard Harrington, about fears for the safety of Ukrainians and their potential to end up homeless. Maggie Filipova-Rivers, of the City of Sanctuary network of 120 local councils, said the delay between Ukrainians being housed and DBS checks conducted on their host was worrying. She highlighted one recent case where a family in Worcester were at risk of becoming homeless after problems arose with their host. “Someone was hosting a family living on a mattress in the kitchen and asking them for money; it was a potential exploitation case,” said Filipova-Rivers. Worcester city council said that although no safety issues had been identified in this case, it had found the property to be “unsuitable”. But the host had ignored this and gone ahead with the placement. Then the council had become aware of “problems in the relationship between sponsor and their guests” – the Ukrainian family had appealed for help on Facebook, which led to a support group providing alternative accommodation in Derby and then Sheffield. Misha Lagodinsky, who runs a matching scheme called UK Welcomes Ukraine, which has 100 Ukrainian- and Russian-speaking volunteers connecting people, said: “Some people are finding that they are homeless straight away because they have a visa granted and then their host fails DBS checks.” Charlie Richards, a volunteer with another scheme, said that he had heard of Ukrainian families sleeping on benches after becoming homeless. Concerns have been building over the failure of the government to release the data it holds on the number of Ukrainians presenting themselves to councils as homeless. A source said it was due to unveil the data shortly, and that numbers relating to the Homes for Ukraine scheme were “very small so far”. The government source added that the intention was never to carry out DBS checks on all hosts before Ukrainians arrived because the priority was getting people “out of danger” first. A government spokesperson said: “The Homes for Ukraine scheme has stringent safeguarding measures in place, and the Home Office conducts security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor’s property.” • The headline, sub-heading and first paragraph of this article were amended on 17 and 22 May 2022 to clarify that the reported concern relates to DBS checks, rather than the Police National Security checks conducted in respect of hosts before visas are issued to refugees. A sentence relating to the Home Office’s pre-visa security checks was also added.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Negative views of Russia mainly limited to western liberal democracies, poll shows",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/30/negative-views-of-russia-mainly-limited-to-western-liberal-democracies-poll-shows,2022-05-30T04:00:19Z,Annual global survey of attitudes to democracy finds many countries maintain positive views of Russia,"The sharp polarisation between mainly western liberal democracies and the rest of the world in perceptions of Russia has been laid bare in an annual global poll of attitudes towards democracy. Within Europe, 55% of those surveyed for the Alliance of Democracies said they were in favour of cutting economic ties with Russia due to Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, whereas in Asia there was a majority against, and in Latin America opinion was evenly split. Negative views of Russia are largely confined to Europe and other liberal democracies. Positive views of Russia have been retained in China, Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Algeria, Morocco, Malaysia, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. The annual Democracy Perception Index, carried out after the invasion of Ukraine, covers 52 highly populated countries in Asia, Latin America, the US and Europe. Majorities in a total of 20 countries thought economic ties with Russia should not be cut due to the war in Ukraine. They included Greece, Kenya, Turkey, China, Israel, Egypt, Nigeria, Indonesia, South Africa, Vietnam, Algeria, the Philippines, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand, Morocco, Malaysia, Peru, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Colombians were evenly split. By contrast, among the 31 countries that favoured cutting ties, 20 were in Europe. Although Russian diplomats will point to the findings as evidence that global public opinion does not share western interpretations of events in Ukraine, the level of distrust of Russia in some countries was high. The countries with a widely held most negative view of Russia included Poland (net negative 87%), Ukraine (80%), Portugal (79%), Italy (65%), UK (65%), Sweden (77%), US (62%) and Germany (62%). Even in Hungary – whose leader Viktor Orbán is an ally of Putin – a net 32% have a negative view of Russia. In Venezuela, often seen as propped up by Russia, the local population has a net negative view of Russia of 36%. Countries with a net positive view of Russia included India (36%) Indonesia (14%), Saudi Arabia (11 %), Algeria (29%), Morocco (4%), and Egypt (7%). Despite the mixed views about Russia, strong sympathy was shown for Ukraine. Most people surveyed in Asia, Latin America and Europe thought Nato, the US and the EU could do more to help Ukraine. In Latin America, 62% of respondents thought Nato has done too little and only 6% too much. In Europe 43% said Europe has done too little and 11% too much. In China, 34% said the US has done too much to help. Nearly half (46%) globally said that the European Union, United States and Nato were doing too little to assist Ukraine, while 11% said they are doing too much. Negative perceptions of China are not as widespread as for Russia. British respondents were the most likely to want to cut economic ties with China if it invaded Taiwan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ukrainian court sentences Russian soldier to life in prison for killing civilian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/23/ukrainian-court-sentences-russian-soldier-to-life-in-prison-for-killing-civilian-vadim-shishimarin,2022-05-23T10:29:46Z,Vadim Shishimarin shot dead Oleksandr Shelipov as he rode his bicycle in village in Sumy region during early days of invasion,"A court in Kyiv has sentenced a Russian soldier to life in prison for the killing of a Ukrainian civilian, in the first verdict in a trial related to war crimes carried out by the Russian army during its invasion of Ukraine. Vadim Shishimarin, a 21-year-old sergeant, was found guilty of killing 62-year-old Oleksandr Shelipov in the Sumy region during the first days of the invasion. The verdict was delivered on Monday by the judge Serhii Ahafonov in a packed courtroom, with dozens of Ukrainian and foreign television cameras crammed into the small chamber. The judge said although Shishimarin cooperated with the investigation and expressed remorse, the court could not accept his claim he did not mean to kill Shelipov when he fired at him. “The murder was committed with direct intent,” he said. Shishimarin, wearing a grey and blue hoodie, listened to the judge deliver his long verdict with his head bowed from inside the glass box for defendants. He was given a translation of the judge’s words from Ukrainian to Russian by a court-appointed translator. Shishimarin was commanding a tank division from the Moscow region that came under attack on 28 February, prosecutors said. The attack led the Russian soldiers to disperse and Shishimarin ended up stealing a car with four other soldiers. When they saw Shelipov riding a bicycle and speaking on his mobile phone, one of the other soldiers told Shishimarin to shoot him, for fear he would give away their positions. Shishimarin fired three or four shots at Shelipov from his Kalashnikov. “I was ordered to shoot, so I opened fire on him and he fell. We carried on driving,” he said in a video interrogation released by Ukraine’s SBU security services. Shishimarin pleaded guilty to the crime, but his lawyer argued that his client was following an order and did not have intent to kill. Shishimarin also apologised to the wife of the victim. “The court cannot recognise the sincerity of his repentance,” Ahafonov said in his verdict. Shishimarin was whisked away from the court after the hearing in the back of a police van. He has 30 days to launch an appeal. Speaking outside the courthouse, Shishimarin’s lawyer, Viktor Ovsyannikov said he would challenge the verdict. “This is the most severe sentence and any level-headed person would challenge it,” he said. He added that he believed “societal pressure” had influenced the court’s decision. The prosecutor Andriy Syniuk said the ruling was “lawful and justified”. It is the first in a number of war crimes cases that Ukraine prosecutors want to try as quickly as possible. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Iryna Venediktova, has said she is preparing more than 40 cases related to war crimes that could come to trial soon, and Ukrainian authorities say they have registered more than 10,000 war crimes across the country. Trying cases so quickly, while the conflict rages on, is extremely unusual and may violate elements of the Geneva conventions, legal experts say. However, Ukraine has made swift justice a priority, partly as a warning to Russian troops still occupying parts of the country that they may face justice for any crimes they commit. In an interview with the Russian independent news outlet Meduza, Shishimarin’s mother, Lyubov, claimed her son was a caring and kind young man who had joined the army partly because there was a lack of opportunity in their home town, and partly to help support the family after his stepfather was killed last year. She said her son called in late February and said: “Mummy, I won’t have a telephone for a week, I have to give it up. If someone tells you I went to Ukraine, don’t believe them.” The next she heard of him was when she found out he was a prisoner in Ukraine, she said. Shelipov’s widow, Katerina, identified Shishimarin as the man who shot her husband during a court hearing last week, and told the court she hoped he would receive a life sentence. “But if he is traded for our defenders of Azovstal, I would not mind,” she said. There has been some speculation that once convicted, Shishmarin and others may be used as part of an exchange for Ukrainians held by Russia, including the more than 2,000 defenders of the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol who recently surrendered to the Russians. Russian officials have veered between calling for harsh punishments, including even the death penalty, for some of the fighters, and suggesting they may be open to an exchange. On Monday Denis Pushilin, the leader of Russia-backed Donetsk separatists, said there should be an “international tribunal” for the Azovstal defenders, many of whom have been called “Nazis” by Russian authorities. “If an enemy [soldier] has laid down his arms, his future fate is decided by a court, if he is a Nazi criminal, this will be a tribunal,” Pushilin said. The Kremlin said on Monday it was following the Shishimarin case. “Of course we are worried about the fate of our citizen. Unfortunately we have no possibilities to defend his interests there,” said Vladimir Putin’s spokesperson Dmitry Peskov on Monday. He said the Kremlin would use “other channels” to assist Shishimarin.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Russian forces have ‘upper hand’ in Donbas fighting, Ukrainian officials say",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/26/ukraine-burying-civilians-mass-graves-russia-advances,2022-05-26T15:02:23Z,"Governor of Luhansk says Ukrainian troops retreating in some areas, as city of Lyman reportedly captured","Officials in Ukraine have admitted that Russia has the “upper hand” in fighting in the country’s east, as Ukrainian forces fell back from some of their positions in the Donbas region. Amid reports that Lyman, the site of an important railway junction, had largely been taken by Russian forces, Ukraine’s general staff reported that Russian forces were also advancing on Sievierodonetsk, Bakhmut and Avdiivka. The governor of Luhansk region, Serhiy Haidai, said just 5% of the region now remained in Ukrainian hands – down from about 10% little more than a week ago – and that Ukrainian forces were retreating in some areas. “It is clear that our boys are slowly retreating to more fortified positions – we need to hold back this horde,” Haidai said. Hinting at further withdrawals, he said it was possible that troops would leave “one settlement, maybe two. We need to win the war, not the battle.” Separately, a senior Ukrainian military official conceded at a briefing on Thursday that Russia had the upper hand in fighting in Luhansk. “Russia has the advantage, but we are doing everything we can,” Gen Oleksiy Gromov said. Haidai said police in Lysychansk were burying the bodies of civilians in mass graves, with about 150 people having been buried in such a grave in one district. If confirmed, Russia’s continuing advances in Lyman, which has been contested for a month, would make it easier for Russian forces to isolate the key city of Sievierodonetsk, which has been under relentless shelling for days. According to accounts posted on social media, Lyman’s Ukrainian defenders had pulled back to the southern outskirts, although fighting was continuing, in particular around the railway sidings in the city. Outside Sievierodonetsk, now the focal point of Moscow’s renewed offensive in Donbas, Haidai said fighting was “very difficult”. Predicting the “coming week will be decisive”, Haidai said the city was being subjected to a “colossal amount of shelling” by Russian troops attempting to batter it into submission. After failing to seize Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv, or its second city, Kharkiv, in its three-month war, Russia is trying to take full control of Donbas, comprising two eastern provinces that Russia claims on behalf of separatists. Moscow has poured thousands of troops into the region, attacking from three sides in an attempt to encircle Ukrainian forces holding out in Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. Their fall would leave the whole of Luhansk province under Russian control, a main aim of the Kremlin’s war. Meanwhile the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, issued a bitter rebuke to the west for not doing enough to help Kyiv win the war. Calling for help “without limits”, specifically shipments of heavy weaponry, he also criticised recent suggestions that a negotiated peace deal could include territorial concessions. Zelenskiy has said Russian troops heavily outnumber Ukrainian forces in some parts of the east, and Kyiv has been trying unsuccessfully to arrange a prisoner swap with Moscow. The heavy attrition on Ukrainian defenders in the east – where between 50 and 100 soldiers are dying every day, according to Zelenskiy – has also led to claims by Russia of large numbers of prisoners being taken. Ukrainian prisoners of war held in the Russia-backed self-proclaimed people’s republics of Luhansk and Donetsk number about 8,000, the Luhansk official, Rodion Miroshnik, was quoted by Tass news agency as saying. “There are a lot of prisoners,” Miroshnik said. “Now the total number is somewhere in the region of 8,000. That’s a lot, and literally hundreds are being added every day.” His claims could not be verified. As Russia seeks to solidify its grip on the territory it has seized, Vladimir Putin signed a decree simplifying the process for residents of newly captured districts to acquire Russian citizenship and passports. The Russian parliament scrapped the upper age limit for contractual service in the military on Wednesday, highlighting the need to replace lost troops. In a late-night video address, Zelenskiy said of the changes to the Russian enlistment rules: “[They] no longer have enough young men, but they still have the will to fight. It will still take time to crush this will.” Earlier in the day, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, told the World Economic Forum in Davos his country “badly” needed multiple-launch rocket systems to match Russian firepower in the battle for Donbas. In the eastern town of Soledar, Ukraine’s salt manufacturing hub, the ground shook moments after Natalia Timofeyenko climbed out of her bunker on Wednesday. “I go outside just to see people. I know that there is shelling out there but I go,” the 47-year-old said after a blast smashed apart a chunk of a salt mine where she worked with most of her friends and neighbours.

"Russian invasion in eastern Ukraine reaching stalemate, says US official",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/may/11/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-forces-pushing-back-russia-troops-in-kharkiv,2022-05-11T11:27:44Z,Pentagon intelligence chief suggests neither side winning despite claim by Kyiv that its forces are pushing Russian troops back,"Russian and Ukrainian forces appear to be settling into a gruelling and deadly stalemate in Ukraine’s east, amid warnings from a senior US military official that neither side can win in the present circumstances. Despite an announcement from Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, that Ukrainian counter-offensives around the city of Kharkiv were pushing invading Russian forces back, Ukrainian successes appeared to be confined for now to the far north-eastern and south-western flanks of the 300-mile frontline. Further south-east, along the frontline in the Donbas region, Russian forces have deployed a relentless artillery barrage and managed to take some territory. Ukrainian forces announced their retreat from the city of Popasna at the weekend. Severodonetsk, the easternmost city still held by Ukrainian forces, is virtually surrounded and the last parts of Luhansk region not under Russian control are within range of its heavy artillery. In towns and cities near the frontline, constant Russian shelling and bomb and missile attacks on civilian targets have largely emptied the streets. They include a weekend strike on a school in Bilohorivka thought to have killed at least 60 people. The government urged those who could to evacuate areas that may experience heavy fighting, and though tens of thousands of people unable or unwilling to leave are still in their homes, they venture out into the streets only for essential errands. On Wednesday, rocket strikes hit two districts of Slovyansk city, Vadym Lyakh, head of the city administration, said. Russian forces also shelled civilian buildings in the town of Bakhmut, around 30 miles south, authorities there said. “The Russians aren’t winning, and the Ukrainians aren’t winning, and we’re at a bit of a stalemate here,” said Lt Gen Scott Berrier, director of the Pentagon’s Defense Intelligence Agency, who gave evidence on Tuesday alongside Avril Haines, the US national intelligence director, to the Senate armed forces committee. The assessment was delivered as the Russian military claimed its forces had advanced as far as the border between the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, potentially edging to securing control of the Donbas region despite losing ground around Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. Zelenskiy said in his nightly address on Tuesday that he had “good news” from Kharkiv. “The occupiers are gradually being pushed away,” he said. “I am grateful to all our defenders who are holding the line and demonstrating truly superhuman strength to drive out the army of invaders.” The tenuous nature of the advances was highlighted by the head of the Kharkiv regional state administration, Oleg Synegubov, who conceded that, while the four villages had been retaken, fierce battles were still raging. Tetiana Apatchenko, a spokesperson for the 92nd Separate Mechanised Brigade, the main Ukrainian force in the area, confirmed that Ukrainian troops had in recent days recaptured the settlements of Cherkaski Tyshky, Ruski Tyshki, Borshchova and Slobozhanske, in a pocket north of Kharkiv. Russia and Ukraine have made inflated claims about their successes, with assessments from western defence and intelligence officials in recent weeks often painting a more subdued picture. On Wednesday, the latest update from the UK’s Ministry of Defence pinpointed the continuing struggle for Zmiinyi Island as increasingly crucial for Russian efforts to dominate the Black Sea. The MoD said: “Fighting continues at Zmiinyi Island, also known as Snake Island, with Russia repeatedly trying to reinforce its exposed garrison located there. “Ukraine has successfully struck Russian air defences and resupply vessels with Bayraktar drones. Russia’s resupply vessels have minimum protection in the western Black Sea, following the Russian navy’s retreat to Crimea after the loss of the Moskva. “Russia’s current efforts to augment its forces on Zmiinyi Island offer Ukraine more opportunities to engage Russian troops and ‘attrit materiel’. If Russia consolidates its position on Zmiinyi Island with strategic air defence and coastal defence cruise missiles, they could dominate the north-western Black Sea.” Recent aerial images from the island following Ukrainian drone attacks showed columns of smoke from Russian positions. A Russian landing craft hit close to the island at the weekend appeared to have been involved in efforts to reinforce Russian troops there. Graphically underlining the grim nature of the fighting, the press service of the Azov brigade, a Ukrainian unit that has historical far-right affiliations and which is trapped by Russian forces inside the Azovstal steel mill in Mauripol, released images of wounded soldiers, many missing limbs and being cared for in unsanitary conditions. Warnings of a “prolonged war” not least from Haines in her testimony to Senate members, has come amid a mounting recognition in western capitals that both Moscow and Kyiv are increasingly bound by more maximalist war aims, making a negotiated end to the fighting complicated. With many analysts viewing any backing down by the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, over the refocused Russian campaign in the south and east of the country as political suicide, Kyiv appeared to be insisting that its war aims now included regaining territory lost in 2014. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Ukrainian foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, said Ukraine initially believed victory would be the withdrawal of Russian troops to positions they occupied before the invasion. “Now if we are strong enough on the military front, and we win the battle for Donbas, which will be crucial for the following dynamics of the war, of course the victory for us in this war will be the liberation of the rest of our territories.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As war drags on, Ukrainians start to ask: could we have prepared better?",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/03/ukraine-russia-war-ukrainians-question-mistakes-preparations-buildup,2022-06-03T12:04:24Z,Some are looking back at weeks before invasion and asking if more could have been done,"When Russia’s invasion of Ukraine began in the early hours of 24 February, with mass missile strikes and the advance of a land force from several directions, many key Ukrainian officials were apparently caught by surprise. Some were fast asleep. There had been rumours of a Russian invasion for weeks, and the previous evening US and Ukrainian intelligence received information that pointed to an invasion that night with almost certainty. Yet there was little in the way of last-minute efforts to fortify towns close to the border, or to warn citizens to brace for the inevitable. President Volodymyr Zelenskiy was at home with his wife and children. Numerous officials in charge of key regions close to the border, and mayors of cities containing strategic military targets, have told the Guardian in interviews over recent weeks that they were in bed and woke up in shock at the sound of booms, rather than having spent the final hours of peace coordinating the defence of their towns. It is possible it would not have made a difference anyway, but as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine reaches the 100-day mark some are starting to look back at the period in the buildup to the war and ask if more could have been done. There is widespread acknowledgment, even among Zelenskiy’s fiercest political opponents, that his wartime leadership has been defiant and inspirational. But along with the praise there are also questions about those weeks before the war, in January and February. Why did Zelenskiy remain sceptical of the increasingly alarming warnings from US intelligence that Vladimir Putin was planning a full-scale invasion? Could he have done more to prepare the country? Would it have had much effect? “We don’t want to initiate an investigation for a while, but we cannot avoid it in the future,” said Volodymyr Ariev, an MP with the European Solidarity party of the former president Petro Poroshenko. He said his party had been pushing for weeks in the run-up to the invasion for the government to take the threat of war more seriously. For much of January and February, the Americans were claiming privately and publicly that their intelligence showed there was a very high likelihood that Russia’s military buildup was not a bluff. Zelenskiy, meanwhile, was impressing on the Americans that he had to balance preparations for war with concerns for the economy, and telling Ukrainians not to panic. “If everyone thinks there will be war tomorrow, the economy will be in real trouble,” a high-ranking government official said at the time. In the first weeks of the year, Ukraine’s long-planned “territorial defence” structures were formalised, and many Ukrainians began to search for their nearest bomb shelter, as the talk of war hung in the air. But few people genuinely believed the threat was real, and many millions of Ukrainians did not make even elementary preparations for the onset of full-scale conflict and weeks of life in bomb shelters or basements. For some, this lack of planning would have terrible consequences when the war did come. Many people were reassured by the calming messaging coming from senior Ukrainian officials. In late January Zelenskiy called the frequent US warnings of possible war a “mistake”. On 6 February his adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the chances of resolving the crisis through negotiations were “substantially higher” than the threat of attack. Ukrainian officials became increasingly frustrated with Washington’s public warnings of invasion. When US defence officials briefed media outlets that Russia had moved supplies of blood close to the border, seen as a sign of imminent military action, Ukraine’s deputy defence minister, Hanna Maliar, categorically denied the report. “The purpose of such information is to spread panic and fear in our society,” she told the Guardian at the time. But as February went on, US officials became more and more convinced that the Ukrainians – and some European allies – were not taking the threat seriously enough. There were frequent phone conversations between various senior officials in Washington and their counterparts in Kyiv. On 11 February the US embassy in Kyiv called in diplomats from a large number of embassies in the city. The visitors were brought to a secure part of the embassy, small groups at a time, and handed sheets of paper on which was printed information about the likelihood and severity of Russian military action, according to three people with knowledge of the meetings. They were allowed to take notes but not to take the papers away. Soon after, the remaining US diplomats in Kyiv were evacuated to Lviv. “It isn’t just time to leave Ukraine, it is past time to leave Ukraine,” a senior US administration official said. Several other embassies followed the Americans west. Ukrainian intelligence was also receiving its own information, and around 17 February it got word about a number of Russian military orders that had been signed off that suggested something major was brewing. But still there was disbelief that this could mean the Americans had been right all along. “Most people believed it would be limited to something in the Donbas and the Russians would not try the full-scale operation,” said a source close to the Ukrainian intelligence services. Some people in the services were much more worried than others. “You could tell from what people were saying to you, and how worried they were, which foreign intelligence services they had contacts in,” said the source. When the invasion did come, Zelenskiy and his team ignored offers from western countries to evacuate, and provided spirited leadership that helped kickstart the fierce Ukrainian defence efforts. For now, this bravery and determination, as well as the need for unity during wartime, has prevented any backlash over possible mistakes in the buildup. Serhiy Taruta, a businessman and MP who in 2014 was the Kyiv-appointed governor of the Donetsk region, said it was too early to raise issues about the buildup, but later a discussion would be necessary. “Of course there are a lot of questions, the Russians were already drawing the letter Z on their equipment and everyone was saying something is coming, and our guys here were saying ‘don’t worry’. But that’s for after the war. Now is the time for the consolidation of society,” he said in an interview. In retrospect, perhaps the best argument for why many in the Ukrainian elite did not believe the US intelligence could be accurate can be found in the dismal failure of Russia’s attempt to take the major cities of Kyiv and Kharkiv. “It just didn’t compute,” said the source close to the intelligence services. “A takeover of Kyiv and the whole country in a few days? We thought it would be a disaster for Russia. And it was. We didn’t think Putin could be that stupid.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus, robot recruiters might be to blame if you are struggling to get a new job<br>","Good morning. Ukraine’s government has suggested Kyiv could expand its own war aims with an intensifying counteroffensive against Russia’s forces, and said it would suspend the flow of Russian gas through its country to Europe. With the war now in its 11th week and Russia pounding the vital port of Odesa with missile strikes in an apparent effort to disrupt supply lines, the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said late last night that the military was gradually pushing Russian troops away from the key city of Kharkiv and back towards the border with Russia. The Ukrainian military’s general staff said its forces drove the Russians out of four villages to the north-east of Kharkiv, a key city that has been under attack from the Russians since the beginning of the conflict. Meanwhile, trapped and wounded Azovstal soldiers are pleading for rescue. In what way might they expand? Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, seemed to indicate that the country could go beyond merely pushing Russia back to areas it or its allies held on the day of the 24 February invasion and mean “the liberation of the rest of our territories”. What else is happening? Here’s what we know on day 77 of the invasion. Pro-choice states rush to pledge legal shield for out-of-state abortions After the bombshell leak of a supreme court draft opinion last week revealed that the majority of justices plan to overturn Roe v Wade, a handful of states have been reaffirming and expanding their abortion care. In recent days, a flurry of bills and statements have been emerging in largely Democratic-run states as lawmakers and organizations scramble to prepare for the possibility of a post-Roe America. As some states seek to become “safe havens” for out-of-state abortion seekers, other states have been increasing abortion funding, expanding provider access and offering legal protections from lawsuits launched by citizen “bounty-hunters” against those involved in abortions. Only 38% of women of reproductive age live in states that have shown support for abortion rights, according to the research organization Guttmacher Institute. In contrast, 58% live in states that have demonstrated hostility towards abortion rights. Only 4% of women live in middle-ground states. Last month, the New York state senator Liz Krueger introduced a bill that would shield New York doctors who offer abortion services to out-of-state patients. Al Jazeera accuses Israeli forces of killing journalist in West Bank Al Jazeera has accused Israel of deliberately killing one of its reporters during a firefight between Israeli security forces and Palestinian gunmen in the occupied West Bank town of Jenin. Shireen Abu Akleh, 51, a Palestinian American and one of the Arab world’s most well-known reporters who had covered the conflict for decades, was shot in the head this morning and taken to hospital in critical condition. She had been covering a military raid in a northern town and nearby refugee camp, a historical flashpoint in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Abu Akleh was wearing a helmet and body armour clearly marked as “press”. The Qatar-based television network said her colleagues at the scene said the veteran reporter was shot by Israeli forces. In a statement, Al Jazeera called on the international community to hold Israeli forces accountable for their “intentional targeting and killing” of Abu Akleh. “In a blatant murder, violating international laws and norms, the Israeli occupation forces assassinated in cold blood Al Jazeera’s correspondent in Palestine,” it said. What has the Israeli military said? A statement said its troops had shot back after coming under “massive fire” in Jenin and that “there is a possibility, now being looked into, that reporters were hit – possibly by shots fired by Palestinian gunmen”.

Ukraine more than doubles interest rates as it fights economic crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/02/ukraine-raises-interest-rates-to-25-in-first-increase-since-russian-invasion,2022-06-02T16:58:36Z,"Central bank moves to stem double-digit inflation and protect currency, taking borrowing to highest level since 2015","Ukraine more than doubled interest rates to 25% on Thursday in a move to try to stem double-digit inflation and protect its currency, which has collapsed since Russia’s invasion. In the first interest rates intervention since Vladimir Putin’s troops attacked on 24 February, the Ukrainian central bank’s governor, Kyrylo Shevchenko, increased the benchmark interest rate from 10% to 25%. It takes borrowing costs to their highest level since September 2015 – when Ukraine’s economy was reeling from Russia’s annexation of Crimea – and the highest in Europe. The Russian invasion has devastated Ukraine’s economy, which the World Bank has forecast could shrink by at least a third this year. The war has forced businesses to close, destroyed infrastructure, blocked shipping routes and reduced whole towns to rubble. Shevchenko called for talks with the International Monetary Fund on a new aid programme. The increase was criticised by an adviser to President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s office, who said the rate was too high and dangerous to the economy during wartime. It was not clear whether he was speaking in a personal capacity. The National Bank of Ukraine had frozen its main rate 10% at the start of the invasion, but last week signalled it could resume regular monetary policy reviews as business activity partially recovered in safer parts of the country. It is betting that a sharp rate rise will also nudge the government to lift the yield on domestic bonds, making assets held in its currency, the hryvnia, more attractive and preventing household incomes and savings from being eroded by inflation. Inflation was already in double digits before the conflict began and climbed further to about 17% in May from 16.4% in April, according to central bank estimates. It said inflation could double in 2022 from 10% in 2021, pushed up by rising global prices and the damage of the war on domestic production and supply chains. The number of small businesses that had suspended operations in April fell to 26% from 73% in March, according to a survey by the European Business Association, the union of businesses operating in Ukraine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
